https://www.dw.com/en/germany-undeterred-by-global-turmoil-scholz/a-67860274,POLITICS,Germany undeterred by global turmoil — Scholz 30.12.2023,"In his New Year's message, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz acknowledged the tough global landscape but expressed confidence that ""Germany will get through it.""
""So much suffering; so much bloodshed. Our world has become a more unsettled and harsher place. It's changing at an almost breathtaking speed,"" Scholz said, according to the text of his speech released by his office ahead of the broadcast on New Year's Eve.
""The result is that we, too, are having to change. This is a worrying thing for many of us. In some, it is also causing discontent. I do take that to heart.""
The German leader, however, struck an optimistic note and highlighted the obstacles the country successfully overcame in 2023, both domestically and internationally.
""Our strength resides in our readiness to compromise – in the efforts we put in for one another,"" Scholz asserted. 
With many key general elections to be held worldwide in 2024, most notably in the United States, United Kingdom, India and the European Parliament, Scholz reiterated the importance of these elections — particularly in the US — with wars still raging in Ukraine and the Middle East.
The chancellor emphasized that Germany's strength resides in the European Union.
""It's so important for Europe to emerge unified and strengthened from the European elections in the coming year,"" he said.
""After all, Russia's war in the east of our continent is not over. Nor is the armed conflict in the Middle East. The year ahead will also bring presidential elections in the United States, which may have far-reaching consequences — including for us here in Europe.""
With inflation having sunk from an average of 7.9% in 2022 to 3.2% in November 2023, the lowest level in two years, Scholz spoke of a much brighter economic outlook than a year ago — even if Germany's rate of inflation is still some way higher than the Eurozone average of 2.4%.
He also referenced Germany's replenished gas supplies, which he described as ""filled to the brim"" and said the country avoided an economic downturn.
""Do you remember where we stood one year ago?"" Scholz asked. ""Numerous experts had forecast an economic downturn of three, four, five percent. Many feared that prices would keep on rising. There were concerns about power cuts and cold homes.
""Things have turned out differently,"" he concluded. ""Inflation has gone down. Wages and pensions are going up. Our gas storage facilities are filled to the brim for the winter.""
""We held back that economic downturn,” Scholz added. ""We saved energy, and we made timely preparations. We all did - together"".
Scholz, who is the leader of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD), also said the coalition government will prioritize upgrading road and rail infrastructure in what he described as a need to ""invest powerfully in the future.""
The SPD governs alongside the Greens and the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP).
""As anyone will have noticed who travels by train these days, or sits in a traffic jam on the approach to a crumbling bridge, our country has been driven into the ground for too long,"" he said. ""That's why we're investing now — in decent roads and a better railway.""
But he acknowledged the Constitutional Court decision in November that unused pandemic funds could not be repurposed for climate and green industry projects meant, ""we will not be able to implement all the plans we had envisaged.""
Scholz believed that every person in Germany plays a vital role, and with mutual respect, ""we need to have no fear about the future.""
""Then the year 2024 will be a good year for our country  even if some things do turn out differently from the way we imagine them today, on the eve of that New Year.""

https://www.dw.com/en/taiwan-presidential-candidates-debate-in-shadow-of-china/a-67860072,POLITICS,Taiwan: Presidential candidates debate in shadow of China 30.12.2023,"Taiwan's presidential candidates argued over ways to handle the island's relationship with Beijing during a TV debate on Saturday, two weeks ahead of the election set for January 13.
Beijing, which sees Taiwan as part of its territory, had previously halted high-level communications with the administration of outgoing Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen amid the rising threat of conflict.
Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has campaigned for the election on a ticket of sovereignty separate from China.
During Saturday's often testy debate, the DPP's candidate Lai Ching-te described himself as a ""pragmatic worker of Taiwan independence.""
But his opponents accused the current vice president of trying to ""undermine Taiwan's security.""

Lai remained defiant, at one point insisting that, ""The sovereignty of Taiwan belongs to the 23 million people in Taiwan. It does not belong to (China).""
The vice president, who currently tops most opinion polls, promised to help strengthen Taiwan's defense and economy if elected.
Lai also accused Hou Yu-ih, the candidate for the Kuomintang (KMT) party — which has closer ties with Beijing — of being pro-China.
""I will not go backward (to the past) like the Kuomintang and be willing to become a vassal of totalitarianism... There are so many uncertainties regarding their policies and this is not the path we want to take,"" Lai insisted.
The KMT's Hou accused Lai of smearing him, saying he opposed both Taiwan's independence and China's ""one country, two systems"" model of autonomy that has been offered to the self-ruled island.
The same model has been used by Beijing to govern Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to China in 1997.
""The current status quo is that the Taiwan Strait is on the brink of war. So, to maintain close ties with the United States while also making peace with China is the solution to the problem,"" Hou insisted.
The third presidential candidate, former Taipei mayor Ko Wen-je from the small Taiwan People's Party, said his bottom line on engaging with China was the protection of Taiwan's current political system and way of life.
""With this bottom line, I'm willing to talk to [Beijing],"" he said.

Taiwan split from China amid a civil war in 1949, but Beijing has vowed to retake the island by military force if necessary.
The January 13 presidential and parliamentary elections will take place amid the backdrop of strong military and political pressure from Beijing, which in recent months has included sending daily warplanes and naval vessels around the island.
Differences over Taiwan are also a major flashpoint in US-China relations.
The US officially follows the ""One China Policy"" which does not recognize Taiwan as an independent nation. At the same time, however, Washington has close ties with the island and has vowed to ensure that Taiwan has the resources to defend itself. The US also seeks to prevent any unilateral changes of Taiwan's status by Beijing.
After the debate, Beijing criticized Lai's performance as ""full of confrontation mentality,"" in comments reported by the Xinhua news agency.
A spokesman in China's Taiwan Affairs Office said Lai's DPP was ""sabotaging the peaceful development of cross-strait relations.""

https://www.dw.com/en/emboldened-iran-silences-critics-as-world-looks-elsewhere/a-67859305,HUMAN RIGHTS,Emboldened Iran silences critics as world looks elsewhere 30.12.2023,"As least 690 prisoners were executed in Iran in 2023, as of December 1, according to the human rights organizations Center for Human Rights in Iran and the Oslo-based Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, whose data was based on official Iranian statistics.
However, rights organizations believe a considerable number of unreported executions have been carried out hidden from the public eye and often only come to light years later, when bereaved relatives have the courage to speak out.
""The world is distracted by the Gaza war. The Islamic Republic of Iran is taking maximum advantage of this situation to crack down on its critics, especially with executions that I would characterize as state murder for revenge, and to intimidate society through violence,"" Saeid Dehghan, an Iranian human rights activist, told DW.
Dehghan, who has lived in Canada since 2022, has founded a worldwide network of Iranian lawyers. He heads a legal center called Parsi Law, which provides legal advice to people in Iran. The center also supports international organizations, such as UN bodies, in their efforts to improve human rights in Iran. 
""The sad reality is that as soon as the streets in Iran are emptied of protesters, the country is forgotten and the global community returns to business as usual with the Islamic Republic,"" said Dehghan. 
""Human rights activists understand that every country worldwide pursues its own interests. Nevertheless, the massive oppression in Iran must not be ignored. Especially not by politicians in Western countries, where human rights are one of the fundamental principles of politics,"" he added.
At least eight people who were arrested during nationwide women's rights demonstrations under the slogan ""Woman, Life, Freedom"" have been sentenced to death in sham trials and executed in recent months.
One of them was 21-year-old Milad Zohrevand. On November 30, he was executed without warning, and without the opportunity to say goodbye to his family. According to human rights activists, Zohrevand was not allowed access to a lawyer or family visits during his imprisonment. 
""Slaughter and killing do not only happen in war,"" wrote imprisoned Iranian Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi in a letter to UN Human Rights Commission.

In this open letter, which Mohammadi's husband shared with DW, she asks the UN human rights commissioner to take urgent, decisive and swift action to stop executions in Iran. 
""In this world where everything is globalized, is humanity an exception? Is it enough to make a statement on paper? Is the global will to stop the unsafe and widespread executions in Iran's cities paralyzed by empty and baseless excuses?"" Mohammadi wrote.
Since December 3, Iranian authorities have cut off all of Mohammadi's connections with the outside world. She is not allowed to make phone calls or receive visitors. Her voice, and that of other critics, has been silenced. 
On December 2, Iranian rapper Toomaj Salehi was arrested several days after being released from prison. The judiciary justified the arrest with statements he made in a video allegedly ""spreading lies and violation of public opinion."" 
The musician had posted a video sharing details of how he had been arrested and harassed. Salehi was initially arrested for showing solidarity with the nationwide women's rights protests in the fall of 2022, and was later sentenced to six years in prison.
Journalists and media professionals in Iran are under enormous pressure not to publish any critical articles. 
At the end of November, the public prosecutor's office in Tehran took legal action against the newspaper Etemad, which is cautiously critical of the government. 
The newspaper had published a secret document showing an excerpt from a ministerial directive for ""arrests"" and ""other measures"" against women who refuse to wear the obligatory headscarf in public.

According to the document, the duties of Iran's ""morality police"" include taking photos and videos of women to ensure dress code compliance in the ""metro areas,"" including ""inside the wagons."" 
The newspaper published this document after Iran's interior minister claimed on November 22 that female morality watchdogs are citizens who want to ""fulfill their religious duties and prohibit evil."" 
The last victim of this ostensible religious sense of duty was a 16-year-old schoolgirl, who was on her way to school at the beginning of October and wasn't wearing a headscarf. According to a source who spoke with the British newspaper The Guardian, she was attacked by a morality police officer on the subway. 
Instead of going to school that day, she fell into a coma and was taken to hospital. She later died and was buried at the end of October.

https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-prepares-for-another-rowdy-new-years-eve/a-67852283,SOCIETY,Berlin prepares for another rowdy New Year's Eve 30.12.2023,"In Germany, Christmas is all about contemplation and family. New Year's Eve, however, is all about partying.
In Berlin, up to 65,000 people are expected on the ""party mile"" at the Brandenburg Gate alone, where a large stage has been under construction for days. The annual ""Celebrate at the Gate"" show will feature a food truck festival, and numerous musicians are performing. The show will be broadcast live on TV, and of course, the whole thing will be crowned with a big firework display at midnight.
It all sounds like exuberant merriment, but no one can be sure of how much fun it will be in view of the increased risk of terrorist attacks. Security measures are elaborate, and access to the cordoned-off area will only be possible with a prepaid ticket. Bags and backpacks won't be allowed, and fireworks, food, drinks and flyers are also outlawed. And political sloganeering has been banned at party, especially amid Israel's ongoing war with Hamas.

The Berlin police have said there is an increased risk of violence on New Year's Eve due to the conflict in the Middle East. Berlin Police Chief Barbara Slowik has spoken of an ""immense need to protect Jewish and Israeli people,"" following numerous pro-Palestinian demonstrations in major German cities in the last few weeks.
Slowik has also described the heightened emotions ""due to the conflict in the Middle East,"" saying that, with a view to New Year's Eve, ""we are certainly assuming that these emotions will also be acted out on the streets.""
The Berlin police, fire departments and medical services are all on alert. Throughout the year, emergency and rescue services have been targeted by attacks. In a nationwide survey conducted by the German Fire Service Association, around half of the firefighters surveyed said they had been insulted, abused, threatened, or had experienced direct violence while on duty in the past two years.
Last New Year's Eve, rescue and emergency services were attacked with firecrackers and rockets in several cities in Germany. In Berlin, rescue workers were even lured into ambushes, said Slowik. And nobody expects things to be any less aggressive this year. Federal Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has also expressed concern that ""blind rage and senseless violence"" could once again break out in some cities on New Year's Eve.

Police unions have called for tougher action against attackers. ""Ever since last year's violent excesses in Berlin, but also in numerous places in the Ruhr region and even in Bonn, which is actually a peaceful city, everyone knows that something has gone wrong in our society,"" said Jochen Kopelke, head of the GdP police union, in an interview with the Rheinische Post newspaper. ""We must finally react.""
For months, police officers in Berlin have been more visible in what they've deemed as problematic neighborhoods. Meetings have been organized in schools and youth clubs, where police and firefighters have reached out to youth to promote understanding for their work. Authorities have even sent out letters to parents through the schools to ask them for their help.
""Please talk to your children in advance, and tell them that we also want to be treated with respect and tolerance and start the new year unharmed,"" the letter reads.
Berlin police have prepared for their largest New Year's Eve operation in decades. An additional 2,500 police officers from Berlin and other states are on the streets, and 500 federal police officers have also been stationed at suburban and long-distance train stations.
Another 1,000 police officers are set to be on duty in police stations and patrol cars. In some cases, the fire department will be accompanied by police protection, and rioters are to be arrested immediately.
The public prosecutor's office has also added extra shifts, and Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner has announced they are planning decisive action. ""Anyone who attacks the police and fire department must expect a forceful response from the state,"" he said.
As a precautionary measure, private fireworks have been banned in three Berlin districts where last year people repeatedly engaged in street battles with pyrotechnics.
If it had been up to environmentalists and the police union, Berlin would have imposed a citywide ban on fireworks and firecrackers. Instead, after the bans in the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, sellers of pyrotechnics broke new records last year, with around €180 million ($199 million) worth of fireworks set off to mark the end of 2022. Germany's Association of the Pyrotechnic Industry expects the demand for fireworks to be just as high this year.
In addition to the legal rockets and firecrackers that have been on sale since December 28, there are plenty of illegal explosives in circulation, especially in Berlin. The border with Poland isn't far away, and unauthorized fireworks with a much higher explosive force are freely available there.
Instead of the standard black explosive powder, these fireworks use a stronger and faster-reacting substance that can result in uncontrollable explosions. Some of the projectiles contain small hard parts which, like bullets, can cause extremely serious injuries, possibly leading to amputations and death.
Hospitals in Berlin are already preparing for a busy night.

https://www.dw.com/en/albania-former-pm-put-under-house-arrest-in-corruption-case/a-67859246,CRIME,Albania: Former PM put under house arrest in corruption case 30.12.2023,"Albania's right-wing opposition leader Sali Berisha was placed under house arrest on Saturday over a corruption case during his time as prime minister.
A special court responsible for corruption and organized crime granted a request by public prosecutors to have the 79-year-old confined to his apartment in the capital Tirana until further notice, the ATA news agency reported.
""No criminal charge or new evidence supported this new request,"" Berisha's lawyers  Genk Gjokutaj and Sokol Mengjesi said. ""None of the legal criteria required for imposing or escalating such restrictions are met in this case.""
Berisha's legal team plans to appeal the decision, which also bans any foreign travel.
Albanian media outlets reported that several police officers arrived at Berisha's apartment building in downtown Tirana on Saturday.
Berisha has been accused by prosecutors of abusing the power of his office during his first term as prime minister, between 2005 and 2009.

The case involves the privatization of a sports center in Tirana, from which his son-in-law is said to have profited.
The public land was used to build 17 apartment buildings. 
Berisha denies the allegations and has accused current Prime Minister Edi Rama of carrying out political repression to silence the opposition.
Albania's parliament lifted his immunity earlier this month, paving the way for the criminal investigation to proceed.
Lawmakers loyal to Berisha tried to disrupt the session and boycotted the vote.
Two years ago, Berisha was added to US and UK sanctions lists due to suspected corruption and links to organized crime.
He is barred from entering both countries.
Berisha was elected as Albania's first freely elected president in 1992 after the collapse of communist rule. He served as head of state until 1997.
He was prime minister from 2005 to 2013.
Until 2013, Berisha also led the Democratic Party of Albania (PD), currently the country's largest opposition party, a post which he returned to last year.

https://www.dw.com/en/whats-in-store-for-eu-southeast-asia-ties-in-2024/a-67852275,POLITICS,What's in store for EU-Southeast Asia ties in 2024? 30.12.2023,"European Parliament elections will be held in early June, triggering possible changes at the top of the European Commission and the European Council.
At present, it remains unclear whether European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will run for reelection. Continuity within the EU's executive would augur continuity in its engagement with Southeast Asian countries, which has been on an upward trajectory in recent years.
However, a surge by the far right in the elections or a hung parliament, sparking post-election politicking, could disrupt the EU's foreign policy agenda, analysts have said. 

In February, some 200 million voters in Indonesia will also head to the polls to vote for a new president and parliament, and their decisions will have ramifications across the region. 
""Indonesia is regarded as primus inter pares in [Southeast Asia], thus the outcome of the presidential and parliamentary elections in the largest Muslim country in the world will be closely watched,"" said Alfred Gerstl, an expert on Indo-Pacific international relations at the University of Vienna.
""A likely positive outcome is that it can be expected the election will be free and fair, proving that democracy works in Southeast Asia,"" he added.
According to most opinion polls, the front-runner is Prabowo Subianto, the current defense minister and the purported status-quo candidate.
Subianto will put a ""stronger emphasis on strengthening Indonesia's defense capabilities but will otherwise likely follow the traditional free-and-active foreign policy credo,"" said Gerstl.
However, some reckon he will be even more assertive than Joko Widodo, the incumbent president, over the EU's deforestation and environmental regulations.
Indonesia and Malaysia — which together account for around 85% of global palm oil production — in 2021 launched cases against the EU at the World Trade Organization, while their governments decried what Jakarta called ""regulatory imperialism."" 
From December 2024, the EU rules will ban the import of numerous goods, including palm oil, timber and rubber, unless companies can prove they aren't causing deforestation, a requirement that several Southeast Asian governments have said is too burdensome on their countries' small businesses.
Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand are the world's three largest exporters of palm oil, as well as major exporters of other products that could be banned under the EU's incoming laws.
Speaking in November at a forum organized by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta, Subianto said that Indonesia doesn't ""really need Europe anymore.""
""We open our market to you, but you won't allow us to sell palm oil, and now we have problems trying to sell coffee, tea, cocoa,"" he added.

The EU will continue with free-trade agreement negotiations with Indonesia and Thailand which progressed in 2023.
Peter Stano, an EU spokesperson, said he reckons Thailand's parliament will approve the EU-Thailand Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in 2024, allowing many of the engagement mechanisms under this pact to come into force.
Some pundits also think formal EU trade talks with Malaysia and the Philippines could begin next year; the governments of both countries this year voiced their ambition to advance discussions.
Meanwhile, Malaysia and Indonesia, two Muslim-majority nations, have been vehemently opposed to Israel's ongoing military offensive in Gaza and have repeatedly called out Western countries for their apparent ""double standards"" in not supporting a cease-fire in Gaza at the same time as they have militarily aided Ukraine.   
Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after Hamas, which has been recognized as a terrorist group by the EU, the United States, Germany and other governments, carried out a series of major terror attacks in southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostages.
Tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza have since been killed in the fighting, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza.
Calming the tensions over the situation in Gaza will be high on the agenda at the EU-ASEAN Ministerial, a meeting of EU and Southeast Asian foreign ministers, in Brussels on February 2. It will be the ""highlight of the year"" for European-Southeast Asian relations, according to Stano.
""We aim to adopt a joint statement on enhancing our strategic partnership and defending multilateralism in the face of increased global instability,"" said the EU spokesperson.
Laos — a communist-run state and arguably the Southeast Asian country with the least diplomatic engagement with the EU — takes over the chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for 2024 and will host the bloc's annual events and summits for the entire year.
Because of Laos' close partnership with China, some other Southeast Asian governments are concerned Laos could use its chairmanship to advance Beijing's interests in the region, especially over the South China Sea, a maritime area in which China is engaged in increasingly hostile territorial disputes with several Southeast Asian countries.

Another unknown is Myanmar, a country that has been in political crisis since a military coup in early 2021. In the final months of 2023, a major offensive launched by several ethnic armed groups appeared to be tipping the balance against the military junta.
But those groups in December sat down for China-mediated talks with the generals — a possible sign that the most militarily competent of the ethnic organizations might not automatically side with the shadow National Unity Government and its ambitions to build a federal democracy. 
The EU has imposed several rounds of sanctions on the Myanmar junta and its affiliated businesses and increased humanitarian aid to the country this year, as well as engaging more openly with government officials.
But most analysts don't expect a sea change in EU policy, certainly not formal recognition of the National Unity Government as the legitimate government or funding for anti-junta forces.

https://www.dw.com/en/political-tensions-high-in-serbia-amid-vote-fraud-protests/a-67859188,RULE OF LAW,Political tensions high in Serbia amid vote fraud protests 30.12.2023,"""I will continue to come despite the holidays,"" said a student, as she moved through the small crowd in central Belgrade.
Many fellow demonstrators also brought along sleeping bags and blankets to the road blockade, ahead of an even bigger protest planned for Saturday.
""We want proper electoral registers and new elections under fair conditions. I hope many more people will take to the streets,"" she told DW on Friday evening.
But despite these small daily protests in the Serbian capital, the vast majority of people are staying home. Few believe they can make a difference.
""For 99% of people, the election is over,"" political scientist Boban Stojanovic told DW. People are preparing for New Year's Eve parties, and the family celebrations to mark Orthodox Christmas at the beginning of January.
But the pro-European opposition alliance Serbia Against Violence, which ended up as the second-strongest force in the December 17 election, is still trying to spark public interest by resorting to drastic measures.
In the two weeks since the vote, seven politicians have gone on a hunger strike. Some have already given up due to health reasons, but Marinika Tepic, one of the leading opposition figures, has held out the longest at 12 days.
""I'm just hungry for freedom and justice,"" she told reporters.

According to official results, President Aleksandar Vucic's powerful ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) won another landslide victory in the parliamentary and local votes — via massive fraud, claims the opposition, which has called for a new election.
The results of the symbolically important election in Belgrade have sparked the most unrest. The reason: in the capital, the SNS and its coalition partner, the Socialist Party of Serbia, won exactly half of the 110 parliamentary seats. They need just one more to continue governing.
Another possible coalition partner is a surprise wild card, the controversial doctor and conspiracy theorist Branimir Nestorovic. His right-wing populist movement We — The Voice of the People won six seats in Belgrade.
""We are certain that the elections in Belgrade were rigged,"" said Rasa Nedeljkov, program director for The Center for Research, Transparency and Accountability (CRTA). The opposition has said the ruling party used vote buying, voter intimidation, and above all, widespread falsification of the electoral register to rig the election, Nedeljkov told the Belgrade weekly Vreme.
CRTA reported one example of 40 voters registered in a single Belgrade apartment of just 58 square meters (528 square feet) in size, among many similar such cases.

The opposition has also claimed that tens of thousands of voters from other cities or the neighboring Republika Srpska, a Serb-run mini-state in Bosnia, were chauffeured to Belgrade to bolster support for the SNS.
""There were tens of thousands of these 'phantom voters' who don't even live in Belgrade. A third of them actually voted and had a decisive influence on the result,"" a source inside the Belgrade election commission told DW.
According to Serbian law, it is possible for citizens to re-register and vote immediately at a new place of residence. However, bogus addresses would be a case for the police and the public prosecutor's office.
The opposition has also accused the Serbian judiciary of lacking independence. Like most of the media, public employers and oligarchs, it is kept on a tight leash by President Vucic and his SNS.
Vucic has ruled Serbia with an iron fist for more than six years, appearing in almost daily TV monologues speaking about Serbia's economic successes and criticizing the failures of the opposition and the few remaining critical media sources.
Vucic himself was not up for election on December 17 — yet everything revolved around him. He claimed the opposition was aiming to destabilize the country on behalf of Western states, with tabloids reporting they were planning a ""color revolution"" like Ukraine's Maidan protests in 2014 which ousted pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych.
Germany has been cited as a suspected supporter of the protests. The Federal Foreign Office called the events on election day ""unacceptable for an EU candidate country,"" citing a critical report by observers with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
While European politicians have been critical, Vucic has received some support — and not just from Moscow.
On Monday, Christopher Hill, the US ambassador to Serbia, struck a conciliatory tone on X, formerly Twitter. ""I have every confidence Serbia will come through these challenges with its democracy strengthened,"" he wrote. ""All of Serbia's citizens have a right to be heard and a responsibility to express their political views peacefully and without resort to violence.""
The current wave of protests is nothing new for Vucic. In the spring, there were large demonstrations after two mass shootings left 18 people dead, back-to-back tragedies which would give rise to the opposition coalition Serbia Against Violence. So far, Vucic has remained unfazed by such protests.
It could be the same this time, said Zoran Stojiljkovic, who teaches political science at the University of Belgrade. ""Success requires the synergy of three factors: opposition cohesion, the energy and perseverance of the demonstrations and pressure on Vucic from abroad,"" he told DW.
Currently, it doesn't appear the protests will achieve their aims. Observers suspect Vucic will send ""a sign of goodwill"" to the EU by repeating the election in Belgrade — supposedly because he doesn't expect to find a majority there. But many suspect they haven't seen the end of election fraud.

https://www.dw.com/en/belgiums-ambitious-goals-for-the-eu-council-presidency/a-67856899,POLITICS,Belgium's ambitious goals for the EU Council Presidency 30.12.2023,"Asked what makes Belgium especially suited to take over the EU Council Presidency in January, a smiling liberal Foreign Minster Hadja Lahbib recently said ""compromis a la belge [Belgian compromise], that is our secret."" At the December presentation of Belgium's presidency agenda, she added that ""we are better in finding solutions than creating problems.""
Lahbib, who is from the French-speaking region of Wallonia, only entered politics a year and a half ago after a career as a television journalist. She describes Belgium as a ""multilingual, multiethnic country with many ideas"" that is used to discussions and seeking out compromise. Lahbib herself was born to Algerian immigrant parents.
It is up to the Belgian Council Presidency to finalize over 100 outstanding legislative projects in the EU together with the European Parliament until the end of April. Among them are efforts to reform asylum processing in the bloc and regulate artificial intelligence.
At the end of April, the European Parliament will meet for its last plenary session before the European elections are held in the first week of June. Any legislative projects that have not been completed by then will have to be tackled by the next European Parliament and a newly formed EU Commission in the fall.
The Belgian government therefore has little time to waste. Liberal Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, who hails from Belgium's Dutch-speaking Flanders region, wants to push through laws that will facilitate a green restructuring of the economy and increase Europe's global competitiveness. De Croo says Europeans expect the EU to deliver results ahead of the European elections.
""That means protecting our people, that means strengthening our economy, that means preparing a shared future,"" De Croo said, summarizing Belgium's agenda for the EU Council Presidency. ""For Belgium it is the 13th time that we will take over the presidency, we should be knowing what we are doing, I am convinced that we have quite some experience.""
At a special summit on February 1, the Belgian government must try to work out a long-term EU budget that includes €50 billion ($55.3 billion) in aid for war-torn Ukraine. At the last December summit, Hungary blocked this with a veto.
""It is important that we show our continued support for Ukraine,"" said De Croo. Who added that ""the unity of that union will be of critical importance to determine our shared success in the many challenges that are ahead."" He did not, however, spell out how he intends to change Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's mind.
Working with euroskeptic Hungary is difficult, but cooperation is necessary because Hungary will take over the rotating EU Council presidency in the second half of 2024, after Belgium. Hearings will be held over rule of law issues in Hungary, according to Lahbib. Even so, she remained optimistic. ""We work in a trio, for me it is a presidency like any other.""
But it is unclear whether the first intergovernmental talks on the agreed opening of accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova will take place in the first half of 2024. Belgium wants to focus on enlarging the bloc and preparing the EU to take in new members.

The EU cannot continue operating as before, according to Janis Emmanouilidis of the European Policy Centre. Discussions about the EU's internal mechanisms and strategic foreign policy goals are urgently needed, he said at an event in December. The coming year, Emmanouilidis argued, poses many potential challenges for the bloc, among them possible Russian expansionism towards EU borders, a rightward lurch in the European elections, and the possible re-election of Donald Trump in the US.
""If Putin is watching us, if the European elections don't go well, if the US elections don't go well, he might challenge us,"" Emmanouilidis said. ""Are we prepared for such a situation?"" He also said that ""the old logic no longer works, but the fact that we have at least understood how bad the situation is, that we are more brutally honest, is good news, not bad news."" That is why, he said, strategic discussions are overdue under the Belgian EU Council Presidency.
Some Belgian journalists, however, doubt the Belgian government has the strength to push through its ambitious agenda, in view of the local, regional and federal elections being held alongside June's European elections. It is far from clear whether Belgium's seven-party coalition government can stay in power.
The alliance comprises the Socialists, Greens, Liberals and Christian Democrats but is falling behind in the polls. Right-wing parties and radical right-wing separatists in Flanders, on the other hand, are making gains. Their rise could make forming a government even more complicated. After the last election, it took almost 500 days for the current coalition to form.
Prime Minister De Croo, however, does not believe the election campaign will complicate or influence his country's EU Council Presidency, though he himself is unlikely to return as head of government, as his party, the Flemish Liberals, have plummeted in the polls.

https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-police-primed-for-tough-action-on-new-years-eve/a-67858248,POLITICS,Berlin police primed for 'tough action' on New Year's Eve 30.12.2023,"German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser on Saturday said police would be deployed en masse to Berlin for New Year's Eve amid fears of a repeat of violence in the capital 12 months ago.
Faeser also promised that security services would monitor Islamist extremist groups with ""utmost vigilance"" amid fears that anger over Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza could further fan the flames.
""Our emergency services had experienced blind rage directed against them time and again,"" Faeser told the German newspaper Tagesspiegel. ""The answer to this must be tough action by police, but also by judicial authorities.""
The minister's comments came against a backdrop of New Year's Eve 2022 when there were attacks on police officers, firefighters and paramedics in some Berlin neighborhoods. In some cases, the assailants used firecrackers and other fireworks.
Faeser said her ministry would boost the number of federal police at train stations — seen as potential flashpoints  — to help the local Berlin police.
""We are strengthening our federal police forces at the train stations in Berlin with four operational units and other additional units. We will have around 500 federal police forces deployed there,"" she said.
""Apart from that, we are also supporting the Berlin police with another 300 federal police officers.""
Meanwhile, Berlin Police Commissioner Barbara Slowik has promised that some 2,000 to 2,500 officers would be deployed in the city on New Year's Eve, with extra support from the states of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt. 

""Many millions of people in our country are looking forward to a peaceful and happy turn of the year,"" said Faeser. ""After a year that has taken a toll on many, no one wants to experience senseless violence on New Year's Eve.""
Earlier this week, the head of a German police union blamed politicians for failing to prevent an expected repeat of last year. He also called for a ban on the sale of fireworks.
Faeser also addressed the additional threat posed as Israel pursues its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, saying authorities had taken extensive action against the radical Islamist scene in the past few weeks.
Faeser warned there was an increasing risk of radicalization in Germany and elsewhere in Europe, promising that security authorities were monitoring the Islamist scene with ""extreme vigilance.""
Recent weeks saw heightened security at Cologne cathedral after indications that an attack had been planned there for New Year's Eve.

https://www.dw.com/en/who-will-finally-be-the-next-nato-chief/a-67855736,POLITICS,Who will (finally) be the next NATO chief? 29.12.2023,"It's finally clear that NATO will get a new secretary-general. Jens Stoltenberg will soon be stepping down after nearly a decade of service in which he was asked to stay on four times — once even after he'd accepted a new job as head of the Norwegian central bank.
Over those years, given the ruptured relationship with Russia and true trans-Atlantic tension with former US President Donald Trump, it wasn't surprising no one wanted to risk replacing the stoic Stoltenberg, who earned the nickname the ""Trump whisperer"" for his ability to placate the acerbic American leader. But the baton is now expected to be passed at the alliance's 75th anniversary summit in Washington in July, with Stoltenberg's term officially up on October 1, 2024.
Stoltenberg's former spokesperson has suggested the new chief should be chosen sooner than that, to avoid distraction and complications.
Oana Lungescu, herself the longest-serving NATO spokesperson, emphasized that ""it's really important a choice is made early enough and that it is delinked from both the European Union elections [in June 2024] and the campaign for the United States elections.""
Lungescu, now a distinguished fellow at the Royal United Services Institute think tank in the UK, warned that ""the worst thing that could happen would be the secretary-general of NATO being a sort of 'leftover' from late-night negotiations over the EU table or getting caught up in a very messy United States election.""
But they sure don't make it easy. It's one of the most high-profile job openings in the world, yet there's no formal job description, no checklist of required skills nor any way to ""apply."" Those pining for the post will not be invited to interview and should not appear overly eager to be chosen.
While Washington is widely seen as the kingmaker (more about any possibility of a ""queenmaker"" below), any one of NATO's 31 governments can play the spoiler. ""It's really a lot of backroom diplomacy across the Atlantic,"" said Ian Lesser, the Brussels-based vice president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think tank. ""Everything from paperclips to nuclear strategy is done by consensus, so this is part of that process.""
Along those lines, NATO's new secretary-general must oppose Russia — but not so vehemently as to spark fears of escalation — and be prepared to defend the very existence of the alliance without further provoking its detractors. Over the many years a new chief has been pondered, ""nice-to-have"" qualities have also been mentioned, such as being from a country with robust defense spending, from a southern or eastern ally for a change after almost 15 years of Nordic leadership, and how about finally putting a woman in charge?
Many names have come up … and gone down. Previous potential front-runners such as Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and former UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace even reportedly spoke in person with US President Joe Biden about their chances, but both removed themselves from consideration afterwards without explanation.

Currently, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, Latvian Foreign Minister Krisjanis Karins and outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte all openly want the job. Rutte has gradually emerged as the favorite. The second longest-serving prime minister among NATO allies after Hungary's Viktor Orban, Rutte is considered a ""safer"" choice than a Baltic politician, with Moscow's war on Ukraine dominating the alliance agenda.
The outspoken Kallas is both popular and polarizing, and Karins, albeit a former prime minister as well, isn't getting much traction.
""There is the sense that having somebody from the Baltic states to be at the helm of NATO would be somehow counterproductive, not helpful,"" noted Kristi Raik, deputy director of the International Centre for Defence and Security in Tallinn. She disagrees.
""It's difficult to see what exactly the problem is because the relations with Russia are frozen at this point. In any case, we are not talking about the likelihood of starting to restore a diplomatic relationship anytime soon,"" she said.
Nonetheless, and significantly, Rutte is the only candidate who has been discussed by NATO ambassadors, Lungescu revealed, in an informal process parallel to leaders' consultations called a ""dean's coffee."" This takes place when the most senior national representative, currently Croatian Ambassador Mario Nobilo, convenes his 30 counterparts to discuss matters of importance.
""There are some countries that still need to finalize their positions as far as I know,"" said Lungescu, ""but they're working towards a consensus"" [on Rutte].
Even though this all happens behind the scenes, Kallas isn't pretending she hasn't noticed. Speaking at an event with Politico in the US in November, she joked publicly about the apparent downgrading of qualities that used to be considered priorities in a new secretary-general.
""It should definitely be from a country that has spent 2% of its GDP on defense. And it would be nice if it would be a woman,"" she recalled, quipping, ""so it's logical it's Mark Rutte."" The audience laughed uncomfortably, and Kallas' disappointment was obvious. Estonia's defense spending will top 3% of GDP next year, while the Netherlands will not quite reach the targeted 2%. Asked by the host whether she still wants to be considered for the job, Kallas answered in one word: ""Yes.""
How would military penny-pinching play in the US ahead of a presidential election whose outcome could be, as Ian Lesser puts it, ""very challenging politically for Europe""?
Kallas could stand tall behind her budget, but Rutte might have his own ""trump card."" In a White House meeting from 2019, Rutte and Trump were shown joking and clapping each other's shoulders jovially. ""We've become friends over the last couple years,"" Trump said.
Despite the evident consensus-building around Rutte, the Dutchman may hit a near-term setback in Europe in the person of Hungary's Orban, with whom he's clashed on the European Union side of town in years past and who is said to have already announced his opposition to the appointment.
Observers don't rule out a last-minute dark-horse candidate who might tick more of the unofficial boxes. ""Nothing is decided until everything is decided,"" cautioned Lungescu. Whoever ""wins,"" said Kristi Raik, ""it's going to be a pretty bumpy road for sure. It's in any case our job as Europeans to make sure that the US remains committed.""
The only thing that seems certain at this point is that Stoltenberg will get to drop out of another race himself: that of the record for longest-serving NATO secretary-general. Although it's getting close, Dutch politician Joseph Luns was in the job for 13 years.

https://www.dw.com/en/argentina-formally-rejects-brics-membership/a-67856848,POLITICS,Argentina formally rejects BRICS membership 29.12.2023,"Argentina's President Javier Milei has sent letters to BRICS leaders to formalize his decision to withdraw his country from its planned entry into the alliance of major emerging economies, it was announced on Friday.
Milei said the moment was not ""opportune"" for Argentina to join as a full member.
The bloc — made up of G20 nations Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — in August announced it was admitting six new members.
The membership of Argentina, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates was due to take effect from January 1, 2024.
The BRICS nations currently account for about 40% of the world's population and more than a quarter of the world's GDP, with as many as 14 nations mostly from Asia, Africa and the Middle East interested in joining the bloc.
The letters signed by Milei and published by several media houses said Argentina's membership was ""not considered appropriate at this time"" but Milei has expressed his readiness to hold meetings with each of the five BRICS leaders.
The libertarian outsider Milei took office this month after his resounding defeat of Argentina's traditional political parties, and he had vowed on the campaign trail not to join BRICS.
In his letters he said his foreign policy ""differs in many aspects from that of the previous government. In this sense, some decisions made by the previous administration will be reviewed.""
Milei's predecessor, former center-left president Alberto Fernandez, had endorsed joining the alliance as an opportunity to reach new markets.

During his election campaign, Milei said ""our geopolitical alignment is with the United States and Israel. We are not going to ally with communists.""
Throughout the campaign for the presidency, Milei disparaged countries ruled ""by communism"" and announced that he would not maintain diplomatic relations with them despite growing Chinese investment in South America.
Despite vowing to cut ties with major trading partners China and Brazil, he has taken a more conciliatory tone since coming to office.
Milei defines himself as an ""anarcho-capitalist"" and has implemented a series of measures to deregulate the economy, which in recent decades has been marked by state interventionism.
Soon after taking office Milei warned of his economic plans, claiming that there is ""no alternative to austerity and no alternative to shock treatment.""
He insisted that his predecessors had left the country without funds and on a path to hyperinflation.

https://www.dw.com/en/after-a-new-constitution-whats-next-for-chad/a-67851992,POLITICS,"After a new constitution, what's next for Chad? 29.12.2023","Chad's new constitution has entered into force after being approved by the country's Supreme Court, paving the way for civilian rule.
The court on Thursday confirmed the results of the December 17 referendum, which saw the new constitution pass with 85.9% approval and 14.1% against. Voter turnout was 62.86%, with about 8 million people eligible to vote.
Petitions by opponents seeking to overturn the referendum were rejected by the court. It ruled that although there were some irregularities, they weren't enough to affect the outcome.
Fidel Amakye Owusu, an international relations expert with the Conflict Research Consortium for Africa, told DW that Chad's latest move toward civilian rule appears to set it apart from its politically unstable neighbors in the Sahel region. Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger are all under military rule.
""The [Chadian] leaders want the world to see Chad to be a little different or to have a situation that is more unique from what is happening in the Sahel,"" he said.

Chad's transitional president, General Mahamat Idriss Deby, seized power in 2021 after his father and long-term ruler Idriss Deby was killed while fighting insurgents. Deby signed the new constitution into force on Friday.
The new Chadian constitution, however, will maintain a centrally-governed state, despite some opponents pushing for a federal state to help speed up development.
In fact, the referendum didn't even make room for people to decide on the issue as it wasn't on the ballot paper. Chad has had a centralized government since gaining independence from France in 1960.
""No"" campaigners for the referendum had favored a transition to a federal state, arguing that a central government has failed to develop Chad, among the world's poorest nations. A survey published in early 2023 by the Network of Chadian Journalists and Reporters showed that more than two out of three Chadians, or 71%, were in favor of moving to a federal system.
Chadian analyst and professor Gilbert Maoundonodji, of the University of N'Djamena, said concerns about the failure of the centrally-governed state were legitimate.
""After 60 years of unitary state, the weaknesses are obvious. The unitary state has not contributed to achieving national unity, to creating the conditions for sustainable development and prosperity of the unity of the country,"" Maoundonodji told DW.
""And when we see the crises, the different conflicts that the country has experienced, the fears are well-founded.""
Proponents of the new constitution have instead created local level governments and representatives, aiming to allow citizens to vote for their representatives in next year's elections.
But Owusu said that arrangement won't be enough to address the political and developmental needs of Chad's 18.5 million citizens.
""Many Chadians wanted a federal system, but it did not happen. When the system is centralized it gives the central authority more power than otherwise. So, we don't see anything changing,"" he said.
""We are still going to see a unitary system that has not been very effective in place and so much power in N'Djamena [the capital], rather than decentralizing the system for regional government to have that kind of autonomy to take decisions,"" he added.

Remadji Hoinathy, a senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies in Chad, told DW that despite the opposition to the centrally-governed system, it still has some advantages.
""In a highly decentralized unitary state, part of the skills [get] passed to other types of entities outside the central power outside of these entities. Even if they remain dependent on the central entity, they are autonomous entities and therefore a certain amount of power [is] passed to these entities to act at the local level,"" he said.
Presidential, legislative, senatorial and municipal elections are scheduled for 2024, and transitional leader Deby will also be allowed to run for president under the new constitution.
Owusu said it was obvious that the referendum was intended to legitimize Deby.
""This referendum was a way to legitimize the kind of transition that the military in Chad wants for the country, and not necessarily a reflection of the will of the people,"" he said.
Chad's military leaders believe the new constitution is a vital step toward next year's elections, and a return to a civilian regime. Owusu expects Deby to become president when the elections are held, to continue the Deby dynasty started when his father took power in a coup 33 years ago.
""Just like his father did, we would see what is like a pseudo civilian leadership going forward,"" he said.

Many opposition groups had called for a boycott of the referendum, fearing the junta had too much control over the process. That has left many people in Chad, Africa's fifth biggest nation by area and home to some 200 ethnic groups, unsatisfied with the transition process.
""The most important element required for democracy to deepen in Chad is when the people are allowed to own the democracy,"" said Owusu. ""If you deny the people the constitution they want for themselves, then the people cannot own the democracy.""
Owusu warned that allowing the military to dominate the government after the general election could spell doom for the country.
""In the Sahel, what is becoming common and also erroneous is the thinking that the military can do better that the civilian government when it comes to fighting extremism or ensuring stability,"" he said. ""That has proven to be wrong.""

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-braces-for-more-heavy-rain-in-flood-affected-areas/a-67855657,NATURE AND ENVIRONMENT,Germany braces for more heavy rain in flood-affected areas 29.12.2023,"Continued heavy rainfall is expected in some areas of Germany already affected by flooding, the national weather service DWD said.
Much of the country has been hit by severe rain since Christmas Day, causing some rivers to burst their banks, while others are close to their breach point.
DWD said that up to 40 millimeters of rain could fall within 24 hours in some areas of the western state of North-Rhine Westphalia and in the Harz Mountains in central Germany.

Areas along the Aller, Leine and Weser rivers in the northwestern state of Lower Saxony had already been flooded, according to regional authorities.
Lower Saxony requested help from Germany's military, the Bundeswehr, on Friday, with state Interior Minister Daniela Behrens speaking of a ""very tense situation.""
According to the Bundeswehr, six helicopters were put on standby.
A spokesman said that the operation would center around securing dikes in the area around Oldenburg and the region north of Hanover. Personnel and material transport and evacuations of people at risk could also be carried out.
The city of Oldenburg had declared an ongoing ""extraordinary event,"" allowing districts to access emergency services more easily.
Lower Saxony's Premier, Stephel Weil, said on Thursday that the state had never seen flooding of this magnitude.
""Experts have been warning for a long time that the increasingly frequent extreme weather events are linked to climate change,"" he said.
Rising water levels were also expected on the Elbe River in the city of Dresden, which is the capital of the eastern state of Saxony.
The water level reached its peak at 5.92 meters (19.5 feet).

Saxony's flood center had expected the water to exceed 6 meters, which would have triggered the second-highest alert level.
The state's environment agency said that the risk of flooding had been completely averted for other rivers in Saxony.

https://www.dw.com/en/nigeria-government-inaction-blamed-for-escalating-farmer-herder-conflict/a-67843008,POLITICS,Nigeria: Government inaction blamed for escalating farmer-herder conflict 29.12.2023,"The latest attack in the Plateau State reads like a nightmare: 17 communities were targeted, numerous houses burned down, scores of people killed.
""In Mangu local governorate alone, we buried 15 people … in Bokkos, we are counting not less than 100 corpses,"" said Plateau Governor Caleb Mutfwang.
But this is only the latest of many cases of such mass killings in Nigeria's Plateau State this year, which have widely been attributed to the persisting farmer-herder crisis in the West African nation.
While authorities are yet to establish the exact number of casualties from the Christmas attack, Amnesty International has confirmed at least 140 deaths in the Bokkos and Barkin-Ladi areas alone.
The rights organization also cited a slow response by security agencies — a concern also raised by an anonymous victim in Bokkos, who spoke to DW.
""We thought the government would bring in back-up, but unfortunately, that is yet to come,"" the source said despondently

Visiting Bokkos on Wednesday, Nigeria's vice president, Kashim Shettima, tried to reassure locals that they were not being left alone. 
""While it may seem that we have failed you in your time of dire need, while it may seem that you are all alone, I assure you that this government, and most particularly (President) Bola Ahmed Tinubu is here to protect you,"" Shettima said, promising to ""deliver justice.""
But the situation appears to have moved on from a quest for justice to an all-out humanitarian crisis.
Solomon Lukas, another Bokkos resident, told DW that in the absence of government support, most of the vulnerable population had escaped to safety in recent days, while he and other men were staying behind to protect what was left of their community.
""There is serious tension on the ground. We have not slept since Sunday. Our eyes are 24 hours open. People are tired, and the security says they don't have manpower,"" Lukas said.
While Governor Mutfwang described the spate of attacks as ""senseless and unprovoked,"" the head of the Bokkos farmers' community, Edward Dikos called the rate of destruction in Plateau State ""simply unbearable.""
""The Fulani came and for no just reason, they began to kill our people, burn our houses, destroy properties, animals and everything. We don't have food to eat or water to drink,"" noted Dikos.
But meanwhile, the Fulani community is also counting its losses: ""They came and started burning Fulani houses, and all their belongings and they had to run for their lives,"" Garba Abdullahi Muhammad, the State Chairman of the Gan Allah Fulani Development Association of Nigeria, told DW. ""Over one hundred houses have been destroyed, many dead, and several others are missing""
With victim numbers amassing and violence persisting on both sides of the conflict, a resolution of the situation appears elusive, especially in the absence of government-led solutions.
Security analyst Kabiru Adamu, a Principal Partner at Beacon Consult, a Security Research Outfit in Nigeria, told DW that ethnic divisions between the two groups are being exacerbated, as competition for land resources, political manipulation, and the spread of misinformation on social media weigh in on the conflict.
""There are essentially two communities that are divided along several lines. So, the farming communities see themselves as indigenouss and of different tribes. And then you have the other group, which is essentially nomadic,"" he told DW.
Adamu adds that the situation is further being complicated by the religious divides between the two communities.
""The Fulani are mainly Muslims, unlike the first group, who are Christians,"" he said, blaming shortcomings in both the traditional religious justice systems and the inadequate response of government security forces on the escalation.

Both Fulanis and farmers are calling for sustainable solutions and looking for a sense of peaceful coexistence. Dikos has pleaded for dialogue and understanding, emphasizing the need to bridge the divide between farmers and herders.
""They are into grazing and farming just like us. They have the same opportunities and positions as our people. We are not troublemakers; we are peace-loving people,"" he elaborated.
Muhammad meanwhile highlights the role of cattle rustling as a trigger, calling for a thorough investigation with lasting solutions:
""We the Fulani people are not happy with what is happening, and we are calling on relevant authorities to do what is  needed and not take sides. A very strong investigation should be put in place, and a lasting solution should be sought,"" he stressed.
Both community leaders agreed that violence was not the solution, but Muhammed added that while ""violence is unnecessary and uncalled for, if there is injustice, that may trigger violence.""
To prevent further bloodshed, Dikos and Muhammad agree that sitting together to understand why things escalated is the only way forward.
Nigerian President Bola Tinubu's directive to apprehend the perpetrators of the violence and provide aid to survivors offers a glimmer of hope, as locals continue to blame the government. 
""We came to power, promising to uphold the sanctity of every citizen's life, and now is the time to assure you that this inter-community violence which has hijacked the humanities and serenities of this beautiful state, will never persist under our watch,"" Shettima said during his visit.
However, the lack of coordination between State and Federal security structuresand a failure to cooperate with local forces might mean that there will be little in the way of change, says security analyst Adamu:
""The state government's efforts, no matter how well-intentioned, need to be integrated into the Federal Security structure to achieve the objectives of peace and stability in the region,"" he told DW, adding the criminal justice system also needs to be bolstered to prevent future bloodshed:
""Strengthen the criminal justice system so that offenders of both sides, irrespective of identity, political affiliation or whatever are arrested and then they are prosecuted.""

https://www.dw.com/en/yemens-peace-plan-boosts-houthis-regional-influence/a-67853393,POLITICS,Yemen's peace plan boosts Houthis' regional influence 29.12.2023,"2024 heralds a good chapter for war-torn Yemen, hopes Hans Grundberg, the United Nations special envoy for the  country.
""Thirty million Yemenis are watching and waiting for this new opportunity to provide for tangible results and progress towards lasting peace,"" he said in a statement this week. 
Yemen has been at war since 2014, when Iran-backed Houthi rebels ousted the Yemeni government. In 2015, the situation escalated when a Saudi-led coalition of nine countries intervened in an effort to restore the internationally recognized government, which has meanwhile turned into the Presidential Leadership Council. The conflict is widely seen as proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
The reason for Grundberg's present optimism is the outcome of the UN-led negotiations with Saudi Arabia, the Presidential Leadership Council and the Houthi militia over provisions for a nationwide ceasefire, improved living conditions for the suffering population and an inclusive political process under UN auspices.
However, a precise timeline has yet to be published. 
Observers, however, are much less enthusiastic.
""It is not a peace process, and it will not lead to peace, development and stabilization in Yemen,"" Thomas Juneau, associate professor at the University of Ottawa in Canada, told DW.
For him, the latest talks resemble instead a ""political process whereby the Houthis and Saudi Arabia are negotiating Saudi Arabia's defeat and its eventual withdrawal from Yemen,"" he said. 
When Saudi Arabia launched its military intervention in Yemen, the objective was to roll back the Houthis, Juneau said. ""Almost nine years later, what we see is that not only have the Houthis not been rolled back, they are far more powerful than they were almost nine years ago,"" he added. 
Today, the Houthis control much of the country's north and west, they have the capability to significantly disrupt maritime shipping in the Red Sea. They have been able to target Israel, almost 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) away, with missiles and drones, which were intercepted by the Israeli army.
After nine years of fighting, Saudi Arabia's level of commitment has changed.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been open about his wish to exit the costly war, even more after Houthi attacks on Saudi oil facilities in 2019 exposed the kingdom's vulnerability.
In 2023, Saudi Arabia and its former archenemy Iran also improved their ties. 
""The Saudis are using the umbrella of the internationally recognized government to negotiate an exclusively bilateral agreement in which the Houthis will stop firing missiles at Saudi Arabia,"" Sami Hamdi, managing director of the London-based consulting company International Interest, told DW. 
In addition, Saudi Arabia and Israel had been on a fast track to normalize relations, until the October 7 attacks by the terror group Hamas on Israel and the resulting war in Gaza put that rapprochement on ice.
Saudi Arabia has even intercepted Houthi missiles en route to Israel.
""Saudi Arabia is in an awkward position whereby it is seeking warmer ties with the Israelis, in the hope that it can convince the US to offer a NATO-style security agreement through which Saudi Arabia will seek to resist Iran and its proxies in Iraq and in Yemen,"" Hamdi said. ""At the same time, Saudi Arabia is trying not to be seen to be too closely associated with Israel.""
However, in December, Saudi Arabia's political tightrope walk became even more delicate. The United States called on the international community to form a naval coalition, dubbed Operation Prosperity Guardian, to protect civilian cargo ships in the Red Sea from Houthi missile and drone attacks.
Saudi Arabia didn't join the naval coalition, despite being a close US ally and also a direct neighbor of the escalation.
""Saudi Arabia neither wants to give up the negotiation process with the Houthis nor jeopardize security on the Saudi-Yemeni border,"" said Sebastian Sons, senior researcher for the German think tank CARPO and author of the recently published book ""Die neuen Herrscher am Golf"" (""The New Rulers in the Gulf"").
""The abstinence from the US-led alliance in the Red Sea has to be seen in this context,"" he told DW.
However, for Fabian Hinz, defense and military analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Saudi Arabia's role in Operation Prosperity Guardian would not have been a game changer anyway from a military point of view.
""The systems deployed by the Americans in particular are designed to deal with anti-ship missiles or ballistic missiles such as the Houthis use,"" he said.
""The real threat is the asymmetric warfare by the Houthis in the Red Sea, as they exert much more pressure on Israel and Western states through disruption rather than defeating or destroying Western navies,"" he said.
 

On Sunday, a Telegram channel affiliated with the Houthis also shared a map of submarine communication cables, including those in the Red Sea, implying that these cables could be a future target for the Houthi militia. 
For Sami Hamdi, all of this points to a boost of self-esteem. ""The Houthis will act with a sense that there will be no consequences on the [Yemeni] peace talks, even if they further escalate in the Red Sea,"" he said. 
For Yemen's population, which has been plunged into one the world's worst humanitarian crises by the war and is close to a famine, none of this spells good news.
""It is more likely that there will be a new phase in Yemen's war in which the Houthis will be more powerful and in which they will seek to extend their rule inside the country and in the region beyond Yemen,"" said Thomas Juneau. 
""It is now very clear that their ambition is to be an aggressive regional power,"" he added. 
For Juneau, the direct link between the Houthis' political process with Saudi Arabia and the militia's expansionist agenda in the Red Sea and against Israel has become very clear this month.
""The common denominator here is that the Houthis have won the war in Yemen,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-mulls-reintroduction-of-compulsory-military-service/a-67853437,SOCIETY,Germany mulls reintroduction of compulsory military service 29.12.2023,"At the end of October, the Bundeswehr said it counted 181,383 soldiers in its ranks — that's still some distance from the target of 203,000 that the German military hopes to reach by 2025. This has given rise to concern in times of Russia's war against Ukraine, which has once again reminded Germans how quickly conflicts can erupt in Europe.
Since taking office at the beginning of 2023, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has been thinking about ways to make the Bundeswehr more attractive as a career. He said he has received 65 concrete proposals from his ministry on recruitment and reforming training methods.
Even conscription, something Germany ended in 2011, is also up for debate. ""There were reasons at the time to suspend compulsory military service. In retrospect, however, it was a mistake,"" Pistorius told newspaper Die Welt earlier in December.
He also cited the case of Sweden, where compulsory military service was suspended and then reintroduced. ""I'm looking at models, such as the Swedish model, where all young men and women are conscripted and only a select few end up doing their basic military service. Whether something like this would also be conceivable here is part of these considerations,"" said Pistorius.

In 2011, the Bundeswehr was being reformed and downsized. The conservative-led government under Chancellor Angela Merkel wanted to save money and professionalize the Bundeswehr at the same time. It seemed that keeping a large number of soldiers was no longer necessary — instead, the plan was for a smaller, well-trained army specializing in foreign missions. The assumption was that numbers could be increased again in the event of tension or defense.
During the Cold War in the 1970s and 1980s, there were almost half a million soldiers in the West German armed forces, the Bundeswehr. Meanwhile, the National People's Army (NVA) in East Germany still comprised around 168,000 soldiers at the end of 1989.
With the post-World War II rearmament of West Germany's Federal Republic in the mid-1950s, all men from the age of 18 were drafted into military service. The idea was that soldiers should be citizens in uniform, a part of the democratic new society. For five and a half decades, almost all young men did either military service or opted for civilian service in retirement homes or hospitals.
From 1962, the GDR also introduced general compulsory military service for all men between the ages of 18 and 26 for a basic military service of 18 months. The only recognized reason for refusal was religious conviction.
With German reunification, the NVA was disbanded and partially integrated into the Bundeswehr. Some 18,000 soldiers were transferred, including 3,000 officers. Due to international agreements following German reunification in 1990, the German Bundeswehr then had to be reduced to 370,000 soldiers.

Today, the Bundeswehr is a professional army made up of volunteers — but the volunteers are no longer coming. As journalist and defense and security policy expert Thomas Wiegold told DW: ""A major frustration in the Bundeswehr is the bureaucracy. Applicants often wait six months for a reply to a letter of application,"" he said. And the Bundeswehr is not seen as an especially attractive employer in a job market already short of workers.
When Pistorius floated his ideas about conscription in December, he faced a barrage of criticism, including from within his own center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). Party co-chair Saskia Esken said it would be impossible to implement mandatory recruitment on an ad hoc basis ""because the training units required for this are no longer available.""
Criticism also came from the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP), the smallest member in the three-way coalition that makes up the federal government. ""The reintroduction of compulsory service would be a serious encroachment on the freedom of young people who want to orient themselves professionally,"" FDP parliamentary group leader Christian Dürr warned in an interview with the Funke Mediengruppe.

But there has been support from the conservative opposition. Johann Wadephul, deputy leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) parliamentary group, told DW: ""The CDU's position here is clear: we are in favor of general compulsory service, i.e. service in the Bundeswehr, but also in other emergency services."" The latter would include fire departments, the Federal Agency for Technical Relief and a number of charitable organizations set up to help in crisis situations.
""Now is the time for young people to be asked what they can do for our country and for our society,"" added Wadephul.
""That question is difficult to answer,"" said Wiegold, pointing out that the security situation has changed radically, especially since Russia's war against Ukraine.
Wiegold believes compulsory military service, as it existed in Germany before 2011, will probably not be reinstated. If only because back then, it did not include women. However, he does not want to completely rule out other forms of compulsory service.
""Who would have thought around two years ago that the Bundestag would decide on setting up a special fund of €100 billion for the Bundeswehr against the backdrop of a Russian war of aggression?"" Wiegold asked.
""I am examining all options,"" Pistorius said. ""But every model, no matter which one, also needs political majorities to implement it.""

https://www.dw.com/en/russia-china-ahead-in-race-for-bolivias-lithium/a-67843534,BUSINESS,"Russia, China ahead in race for Bolivia's lithium 29.12.2023","Bolivian President Luis Arce's biggest opponent currently comes from his own political party. Arce's predecessor, Evo Morales, who was in power from 2006 to 2019, is making life difficult for the socialist government and has repeatedly publicly questioned his former economy minister.
Now a major contract for raw material rights has come at just the right time for the current leader. The contract is indeed impressive, and the hope is that it can help solve Bolivia's ongoing economic crisis in the medium term.
According to official information, Russia's Uranium One Group plans to invest around $450 million (€405 million) in a pilot project for lithium production in the South American country.
Geologists assume Bolivia has the potential to find 23 million tons of lithium. This would make it the country with the largest reserves in the world, an important fact when considering how important the metal is for making batteries for things like electric cars.
For Bolivia, the agreement is more than a mining contract. After years of political squabbles — where Morales and Arce each played their part — the country is trying to present itself as a reliable partner.
Karla Calderon, president of the Bolivian state-owned lithium company YLB, outlined the project, which will be carried out in ""Colcha K"" in the Potosi Department in three phases.
In the first phase, the goal is to produce 1,000 tons of lithium carbonate per year, in the second phase up to 8,000 tons and a further 5,000 tons in phase three.
The focus will be on production that is as environmentally friendly as possible. This project will be used to carry out studies to demonstrate the technical sustainability of this future facility, said Calderon.
The contract is the second agreement signed with the subsidiary of the Russian state-owned company Rosatom. In June, the contracting parties agreed to build a lithium carbonate industrial complex in Pastos Grandes.

""The competition for lithium is tough,"" said Vladimir Rouvinski, an expert on Latin America-Russia relations at Icesi University in Colombia.
""It seems that strategic alliances are being forged that suit the current governments. The Bolivian government is showing a preference for Chinese and Russian companies,"" Rouvinski told DW.
""Ultimately, however, these alliances are short-lived because the logic of economics is that economic interests take precedence over temporary affinities.""
China has also been able to get its foot in the door in the country with the world's largest lithium reserves. Under the leadership of the Chinese group Contemporary Amperex Technology, CATL, Chinese partners want to invest a total of $1.4 billion in the construction of lithium extraction plants.
President Arce has, however, left the door open to partners outside of Russia and China. ""Our visits to the European Union, Brazil and the BRICS countries have clearly shown that there is great interest in our lithium,"" he said recently.
Arce knows Bolivia could be making quicker progress in the extraction of its lithium deposits, but warns against moving too fast. ""The old saying applies that we go slowly because we are in a hurry,"" he said.
Lithium is needed to build batteries for electric vehicles, and the metal is therefore of strategic importance for the transformation away from fossil fuels for cars and toward electric-powered vehicles.
Five years ago, Germany was considered the nation that had the biggest advantage in Bolivia. A joint venture between Berlin and La Paz was supposed to be the starting signal for lithium production, and hopes were high in Germany and its important car manufacturing industry.
But then domestic political turmoil in Bolivia followed. The joint venture project became a polarizing election campaign issue and an instrument of a wider domestic power struggle.
The project has since died, and Germany is currently looking to Argentina and Chile, which also have large lithium deposits. To underline this, a deal with Chile was recently upgraded to a free-trade agreement that should ease joint lithium projects.

https://www.dw.com/en/will-brics-expansion-set-a-new-agenda-for-the-global-south/a-67725812,POLITICS,Will BRICS expansion set a new agenda for the Global South? 29.12.2023,"Although a setback, it's one the BRICS nations will be able to overcome: Argentina will not be joining the alliance of states in early January after all, after the new government recently canceled its plans in a statement posted on the X, formerly Twitter. However, BRICS will gain five other new member countries in 2024: Egypt and Ethiopia will join together with the energy heavyweights Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iran.
With this expansion, BRICS is consolidating its status as the voice of the Global South and bringing more weight to bear on international politics. The expansion is taking place with Russia serving as chair — and when Russian President Vladimir Putin rolls out the red carpet for the October summit in Kazan, Russia, there will be twice as many heads of state in the family portrait as before.
The BRICS trajectory has been remarkable: It started in 2001 when Goldman Sachs bankers coined the acronym BRIC for an investment fund. In 2009, the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India and China met for the first time. Finally, in 2011, South Africa became the first African country to join.
This trajectory is all the more astonishing because democracies such as Brazil, India and South Africa have been working pragmatically across ideological lines with autocracies like China and Russia. Even deadly clashes between Indian and Chinese troops on the disputed border in 2020 did not break up the bloc.
The newcomers will also bring with them considerable risk of conflict. Egypt and Ethiopia are fighting over water from the Nile, and Saudi Arabia and Iran have been battling for supremacy in the Persian Gulf for decades.
BRICS can only make decisions unanimously, so neither China nor Russia, and soon Iran, will be able to easily implement their own agendas. Yet, as different as the BRICS nations and their interests are, Johannes Plagemann, a political scientist at the Hamburg think tank GIGA, said there is a basic consensus.
""They want an international world order that is less dominated by the West"" — a stance that is not to be equated with hostility toward the West, he said. In September, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India's foreign minister, made a distinction for his country that is likely to apply to the majority of BRICS states: ""India is not Western, it is not anti-Western.""

BRICS membership alone does not confer greater status in international politics, explains political scientist Günther Maihold. But it does offer a way to avoid taking sides in the growing geostrategic competition between China and Russia and the West.
""With BRICS membership, they are making it clear that they don't want to be drawn into this binary logic and instead aim to secure their independence,"" said Maihold, who teaches at the Free University of Berlin.
Putin's grand reception by future BRICS members Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in early December — despite Russia's invasion of Ukraine and an international arrest warrant — is a clear sign of this independence.
According to GIGA expert Plagemann, Russia heading up BRICS and its role in hosting the BRICS summit in 2024 has several advantages. First, it would demonstrate domestically that Russia is by no means as isolated as the West would like it to be.
""And, of course, the bottom line for Russia is to be able to bypass the West economically, to be able to effectively circumvent sanctions and sell its own raw materials profitably,"" he said.
Even the West's allies in BRICS are scarcely complying with the Western sanctions against Russia. Some even regard the sanctions as a warning sign. The punitive measures against Russia and Iran, such as freezing foreign exchange reserves and excluding them from the SWIFT international payment system, have fueled efforts to look for alternatives to the US-dominated financial system — just to be safe.
Building a real alternative is difficult and takes time. But the United Arab Emirates, for example, is already using local currencies instead of US dollars to pay for gas and oil deliveries to India and China.
Although BRICS doesn't even have its own administrative office, it does have its own financial institution: the New Development Bank. The bank would be able to raise capital once the cash-rich oil monarchies of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates join.
This would be an alternative source of funding for national development projects and could also be a means of dealing with sovereign debt ""that would not be tied to the kinds of conditions that are typical of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund,"" explained Maihold.
Plagemann expects to see further changes as a result of the rise of the Global South and the West's relative loss of power. ""In many areas of international politics, the world will become more transactional,"" he said. ""There will be less emphasis on ideological agreement, promoting democracy, human rights, and so on, and that all parties involved will focus more on achieving their own core interests.""
""What the German foreign minister is promoting worldwide, namely that the basis for cooperation is based on shared values, is not regarded as fundamental,"" stressed Maihold. ""What the BRICS members would say about the rules-based order we are trying to sell is: 'We didn't make the rules. And there is no reason why we should subscribe to or comply with them.'""
As Julian Barnes-Dacey and Jeremy Shapiro argued recently in the US magazine Foreign Policy: ""For the less powerful countries, the rules-based order was always little more than hypocrisy on a global scale.""
Plagemann called for adopting a calm approach to BRICS, and advised viewing the alliance of states as a partner for cooperation where that makes sense.
""If major international institutions such as the United Nations are becoming less and less capable of acting, then the remaining groups, factions and institutions must at least be able to potentially cooperate. There is no point in creating an opposition,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/who-is-sigrid-kaag-the-uns-new-gaza-aid-coordinator/a-67847012,POLITICS,"Who is Sigrid Kaag, the UN's new Gaza aid coordinator? 29.12.2023","Sigrid Kaag is an experienced diplomat who has held numerous high-ranking positions within the United Nations. As of January 8, the 62-year-old will serve as the UN's senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza.
Kaag and her team face a tremendous challenge. Even before Hamas' October 7 attacks on Israel, some 80% of Gazans depended on humanitarian aid. Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, is classified as a terrorist organization by Israel, the EU, the US and several other governments.
Israel's bombardments and its ground offensive have destroyed much of Gaza's infrastructure in almost three months of conflict. Fighting between Israel and Hamas has led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people within the territory, which spans just 360 square kilometers (about 140 square miles).
Israel's army expects fighting to continue for several more months, meaning that almost all of Gaza's 2.3 million inhabitants could well depend on humanitarian aid over the coming year.
At the same time, Israel worries that international aid deliveries could be used to smuggle weapons, ammunition and fuel into the Gaza Strip that end up in the hands of Hamas.
In this difficult situation, Kaag is now tasked with coordinating and monitoring international emergency aid deliveries to Gaza and establishing a UN mechanism to speed up deliveries through countries not involved in the conflict.
It was only in late December that the UN Security Council managed to agree and adopt a resolution calling for ""safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale directly to the Palestinian civilian population throughout the Gaza Strip."" It also paved the way for the creation of Kaag's new position as the UN's senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza.
Kaag is one of the Netherlands' leading lawmakers. She is a member of the centrist D66 party and previously served as deputy head of government and finance and foreign minister under longtime Prime Minister Mark Rutte.
When the Dutch coalition government collapsed and fresh elections were called at the end of November 2023, Kaag announced her retirement from Dutch politics. Prior to this, Kaag and her family had received several threats, including from COVID deniers.
But her time-out did not last long. When Kaag takes up her UN post on January 8, she will be returning to her old place of work. The Arab studies graduate and mother of four has worked for the UN for decades, holding different high-ranking posts in the organization, as mentioned.

From 1994 to 1997, Kaag was the head of the Donor Relations Department at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in Jerusalem. She then headed UNICEF's Middle East and North Africa Regional Directorate in Amman, Jordan.
In 2013 and 2014, Kaag led the joint mission by the UN and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to destroy Syrian chemical weapons. Afterwards, she held the position of UN special coordinator for Lebanon.
Kaag is a certified Middle East expert who speaks six languages fluently, including Arabic. She is married to Anis al-Qaq, who once served as deputy minister for international cooperation at the Palestinian Authority under late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
Afterwards, al-Qaq founded the International Forum for Peace, which aims to promote dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as Europeans and Mediterranean countries. It also works to implement cultural, economic and social development projects.
Kaag was praised by international diplomats for her work helping destroy Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles, which earned her the nickname ""Iron Lady."" One Syrian diplomat reportedly once told Agence France-Presse news agency that ""she never stops working and practically never sleeps.""
Not everyone in Israel is pleased with Kaag's appointment. Various media outlets in the country reported that Kaag has repeatedly criticized Israeli policymaking. They said that when serving as the Netherlands' deputy prime minister, for example, Kaag disagreed with Rutte over what she alleged was his overly pro-Israel stance.
In the 1990s, Kaag accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of using ""racist and demagogic overtones about the Palestinian peace partner"" in peace talks, according to Israeli newspaper Haaretz. And she is said to have once referred to Israeli settlers as ""illegal colonists on confiscated land.""
Israel's relationship with the UN has been strained, and not just since UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' controversial October 2023 speech. Israel is critical of the UN due to a stable pro-Palestinian majority from the Global South in the General Assembly.
Kaag will have to employ much diplomatic persuasion to get more emergency aid flowing into Gaza. She is not likely to get much sleep on her new job, either.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-flooded-safari-park-relocates-smaller-animals/a-67844134,NATURE AND ENVIRONMENT,Germany: Flooded safari park relocates smaller animals 28.12.2023,"Large portions of the premises of the Serengeti Park zoo and outdoor leisure park in northern Germany were totally submerged on Thursday, as the state premier visited to tour the stricken facilities. 
Water had entered some of the animal enclosures, a spokeswoman for the zoo said, adding that staff and emergency workers were trying to create makeshift dams to protect some other enclosures. 
The zoo moved more than 200 monkeys — along with some lemurs, prairie dogs and meerkats — relocating them to another, drier location on site. 
The zoo in Lower Saxony, north of Hanover, is near the Meisse River, which burst its banks after several days of heavy rains over the Christmas holidays that have affected many parts of the country.
The flooding has hit during the park's winter off-season, when it is not open to customers. 

The situation was particularly bad on Thursday at an area of the leisure facility called the Masai Mara Lodges, a section that houses its antelopes and giraffes, as well as some huts for guests who wish to stay overnight.
Water had already entered the stables there, too, but for now the park was not planning to move the huge animals.
""For the moment the water's still below the tops of their hooves, we can soak that up with straw,"" spokeswoman Asta Knoth told the dpa news agency. 
She said that these larger mammals would only be relocated if the situation deteriorates considerably.
""You have to think very carefully before moving a giraffe,"" she said. ""It's not without its dangers."" 
The park had to temporarily cut off electricity for the entire site and switch to emergency generators to heat the stables and prepare drinking water. 
The state premier of Lower Saxony, Stephan Weil of the Social Democrats (SPD), visited the site on Thursday along with the party's chairman at the national level, Lars Klingbeil, to see the situation for themselves. 
The northern German and more predominantly protestant region around Hamburg, Hanover, Bremen and Lower Saxony is the SPD's heartland, where it tends to fare best in elections, and where both the last SPD chancellors, Olaf Scholz and Gerhard Schröder, made names for themselves before moving to national politics.
In the small villages nearby, several hundred people have had to leave their homes because of the flooding.
In Lower Saxony as a whole, warnings are in place for high water levels on several rivers — including the Weser, the Aller, the Leine and the Oker. 
Days of heavy rains led to flooding across much of Germany. Although the precipitation has since stopped, in some cases excess water is still running off into rivers and flowing downstream, leading to continued flood risks even as the storm warnings have ebbed.

https://www.dw.com/en/can-bollywood-bring-india-and-pakistan-closer-together/a-67841796,CULTURE,Can Bollywood bring India and Pakistan closer together? 28.12.2023,"Films in Pakistan need to be cleared by provincial boards that censor anything deemed a violation of the country's social and cultural values.
And, since 2019, movies produced by India's Hindi film industry, based out of the country's financial capital, Mumbai, and more popularly known as Bollywood, have not been allowed at cinemas in Pakistan.
When the blockbuster ""Pathaan"" with actor Shah Rukh Khan was publicly screened in Karachi's affluent DHA neighborhood in January 2023, the censor board in Pakistan's southern province of Sindh, where Karachi is located, stopped the screening.
Relations between Pakistan and neighboring India have seldom been cordial, particularly because of the disputed Kashmir territory.
Nevertheless, many Pakistani cinemagoers are ardent followers of Bollywood and its stars.
Apart from Shah Rukh Khan, known as the ""King of Bollywood,"" whose latest comedy-drama ""Dunki"" was released in cinemas earlier this month, other Bollywood actors such as Aamir Khan, Deepika Padukone and Ranbir Kapoor enjoy a large following in Pakistan.
In the past few years, movies produced in the southern part of India — or helmed by directors hailing from the south — have gained popularity in Pakistan because of their action-oriented and technology-driven storylines.
Adding to the appeal of Bollywood on the other side of the geographical divide is the language featured in the films, Hindi.
Hindi is similar to Urdu, which is the language widely spoken in Muslim-majority Pakistan. Also, some of the artists and technicians working in Bollywood come from Muslim backgrounds.
Despite the tensions between India and Pakistan at the state level, similar cultural aspects beween the two nations persist — particularly when it comes to movies and music.
""I heard a TV host the other day talk about the subject. He was of the view that before 1947, in undivided India, we were making similar films,"" actor Mohib Mirza told DW.
""Our heroes also sang songs in the valleys and around the trees. But I think influence is a different subject. Bollywood itself is not original — it's heavily influenced by many other countries,"" Mirza said.
""The reason that our audiences watch Indian films is the way they 'market' their stuff,"" Mirza added. ""No matter what, we will get the news about what's happening in India.""

But journalist Ghazi Salahuddin disagrees.
""Bollywood has a lot of influence in Pakistan primarily because its films are widely watched in the country for their quality and content, something that we lack,"" Salahuddin told DW.
""They have adapted to technological advancement, as well,"" he said. ""They have a big international market due to which they can afford to experiment and spend a lot of money on their screen projects. India's economic success has a role to play in it, too.""
Indian and Pakistani movies have song and dance sequences, said filmmaker Shoaib Sultan, whose directorial debut ""Gunjal"" was released in cinemas on December 15. ""It's a massive industry. Our audiences watch it because it's entertaining and larger than life."" 
Given that Pakistan lacks a major film industry of its own, movie distributors and cinema owners in the country now largely depend on releases from major Hollywood studios to keep their businesses afloat.
""Until we [in Pakistan] start making movies, people will keep watching Bollywood,"" said film distributor and exhibitor Nadeem Mandviwalla.
""These are the only two countries in the world which make movies the same way: song-and-dance sequences, dresses and the language, etc.,"" he said. ""They call it the Hindi language and we call it Urdu. They use 80% Urdu words in Hindi.""

""Peace activists on either side keep trying to bring the temperatures in the political field down,"" said Salahuddin. ""Indians and Pakistanis travel a lot and have large diasporas, because of which they meet each other outside South Asia.""  
Mandviwalla highlighted the importance of Indian movies in Pakistan.
""Our people know so much about India because of their exposure to its films,"" the film distributor said. ""For the last 40 years,"" he added, ""the Pakistani public has been watching Indian content.""
But, since Pakistan banned Indian movies in 2019, exhibitors and distributors in the country have had a tough time. 
""We [as exhibitors] tell our government that there are only two choices: either allow Indian content or make at least 100 to 150 movies a year, which will help the Pakistani film industry stand on its feet,"" Mandviwalla said.
As government leaders work to resolve the larger differences between the neighboring countries, their people can continue to focus on their cultural similarities.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-doctors-on-strike-at-the-height-of-covid-flu-season/a-67842640,HEALTH,"German doctors on strike at the height of COVID, flu season 28.12.2023","Thousands of German doctors' offices and small clinics are staying shut this week — during a spike in COVID-19 and flu cases. General practitioners and specialists are protesting the government's health policies, which they say are increasing costs, lowering earnings and burdening them with more and more bureaucracy.
Patients are being advised to rely on emergency medical services as more than 20 doctor associations have joined the three-day strike. Since January 1 is a public holiday in Germany, most of the participating practices won't be open until January 2.
""I don't understand why there is a strike,"" said Health Minister Karl Lauterbach, speaking with public broadcaster ZDF on Wednesday evening. ""We have a huge wave of sickness in the population at the moment. The doctors' demands for more money are also well-known — this strike doesn't get us anywhere.""
That sentiment was echoed by Eugen Brysch, chairman of Deutsche Stiftung Patientenschutz, a foundation that advocates for the interests of patients. ""Every profession can go on strike for its interests, but this strike is hitting the wrong people,"" Brysch told DW.
""In rural areas in particular, the actions mainly affect the old and vulnerable. The doctors need to take their issues where they can actually change something — to the ministries, to Karl Lauterbach, or to the insurance companies.""
The associations participating in the strike have argued that the shutdown is meant to protect patients' well-being in the long term, describing the current action as a ""lesser evil."" They argue that more and more practices are being forced to shut down, and more and more doctors are retiring early rather than working for low pay, a result mainly of the ""budgetization"" imposed on them by health insurers.
This budgetization measure, introduced in 1992, fixes a budget on all different kinds of health expenses in the system so that health insurers maintain control of their payouts. The doctors' associations, who are calling for the 1992 measure to be scrapped, have said this means that if they put in more time for individual patients and continue treating people beyond a certain budget — especially in crises such as pandemics — they effectively have to work for free.
""The situation in doctors' offices has become very dramatic indeed because the limitation by budget means that many practices can't afford to pay their specialist staff as much as they should,"" said Dirk Heinrich, an ear-nose-throat specialist and chairman of the Virchowbund association, which is leading the campaign.
""At the same time, we are forced to cut back on treatments, because we have neither enough staff nor money. This leads to long waiting times, and patients not being able to find doctors with capacities to see them,"" he told DW.
But the Health Ministry has shown little sign of giving in on this point, pointing out that doctors are relatively well-paid in Germany, compared with elsewhere in Europe.
""I don't consider the call for more money as justified,"" Lauterbach said, though he added that reforming the budgetary measure among general practitioners would be addressed. ""There are other professions in the health care system, such as care workers, where there is a greater need.""
Lauterbach has shown himself more amenable to the other major problem that doctors want addressed: the burden of bureaucracy. Some doctors have reported that they are so overwhelmed with forms to fill out from health insurers that it makes no sense to open all the letters.
""De-bureaucratization is a justified demand that should have been fulfilled years ago,"" Lauterbach told ZDF. ""We have been working on a law to reduce bureaucracy for months now.""
Lauterbach has promised a summit with the doctors in the new year to address their concerns, though he warned that simply pouring more money into the system wasn't on the table.

Despite these imminent talks, Heinrich insisted that the strike was necessary. ""He also says that the problems are all well-known — well, sorry, if they're well-known, why hasn't he done anything?"" he said. ""That's the problem: He keeps announcing something, and we talk and talk, but nothing happens. So we have to maintain the pressure.""
Germany's non-hospital health care system relies on a network of general practitioners and specialists who run private practices, but who are paid by health insurers, either state or private. This marks it out from the systems in other European countries like the United Kingdom, where the main health care system is publicly run, and where waiting times for appointments have grown longer and longer.
Heinrich said the German system worked comparatively well, but said doctors at the front lines needed more support so that system can be maintained.
""It's not like we had a system that wasn't functioning — our German system works very well,"" he said. ""We have very low-threshold and quick access to general and specialist medicine, we have a dense network of specialist practices. That's a prime feature of the German health care system and we are fighting to maintain it.""

The AfD came in first in recent popularity polls in Thuringia, Saxony and Brandenburg, all of which are to hold elections in 2024.
Maier, a member of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats, told the daily Süddeutsche Zeitung that ""right-wing extremists of the AfD under Björn Höcke are trying to undermine democracy from within by all means.""
""We democrats must face up to a fight for which we are so far ill-equipped,"" Maier said.
Höcke is the head of the Thuringian chapter of the AfD and the leader of its parliamentary party in the state. The Thuringian AfD branch has been classed as ""proven right-wing extremist"" by Germany's domestic intelligence agency, as have those in Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt.
Maier called for a more precise formulation of the procedure for selecting a state premier in Thuringia. He said that the current stipulation allowed a candidate to be chosen in a third round with a single vote even if all other parliamentarians voted against him or her.
""We have to make the constitution weatherproof,"" he said, adding that he sometimes has ""the feeling that we are sleepwalking into a kind of disaster and will wake up in an authoritarian system on September 2.""
Maier pointed to manifold social problems in Germany's former communist eastern states as contributors to the AfD's rise in popularity, saying that people in the east earned 25% less on average than in the west, for example.
He said many people were very worried by the crises facing the world at present, and even sometimes had concerns about whether they had enough money to pay for heating.
""These are social problems that cry out to the heavens. And if we do not address these problems, politics will lose a part of the population,"" he said.

""Ever since the excessive violence last year in Berlin, but also in many places in the Ruhr district and even in the usually peaceful city of Bonn, we've known that something has gone wrong in our society,"" Jochen Kopelke, head of the main German police union GdP, told the Rheinische Post newspaper in comments published on Thursday.
""We must finally do something about it,"" he added.
Setting off fireworks in the middle of the street has long been the New Year's Eve tradition in Germany, but scenes from Berlin last year have led to calls for a rethink.
Police described fireworks being directed at emergency services, with personnel in some cases allegedly lured into traps.
Kopelke warned that ""attacks"" against emergency service workers and other people celebrating the new year were expected again this year.
Police are preparing a ""massive deployment of personnel"" to prevent the outbreaks of violence.
But Kopelke went further, posing an open question in the Rheinische Post: ""Why aren't the police finally given the legal means to take the necessary action against those taking part in the violent excesses? And why haven't we already implemented a sale ban on fireworks?"", and pointing out that such a ban exists for the rest of the year.
The sentiment was mirrored by the head of the German Fire Brigade Association (DFV), Karl-Heinz Banse.
""The state must make sure that those who [attack emergency service workers] are punished to the full extent of the law. This is still missing,"" he told the German news agency DPA.
The head of the non-profit organization Environmental Action Germany (DUH), Jürgen Resch, also called for a ban on the sale of fireworks in comments made to the Rheinische Post.
""We need an end to the gunpowder of New Year's Eve fireworks, and we need it now,"" he said, pointing to the attacks on emergency workers as well as the impacts on pets and wild birds.
He said that authorities had refused to speak with the DUH about a possible ban — one that he said was supported by a majority of German citizens —, adding that Interior Minister Nancy Faeser had just days to impose such a ban.
""If not, then she is responsible for all the violence, the burning of houses and apartments, the air pollution and the many thousands of injured people,"" Resch told the paper.

Klaus Reinhardt, head of the German Medical Association, also spoke to the Rheinische Post, highlighting not only the additional load on the already-full clinic and emergency rooms, but also warning that the unbridled letting off of fireworks could trigger trauma responses for those who have fled war.
Nobody wants to stop New Year's Eve celebrations, Reinhardt said, but ""uncontrolled explosions"" are not a necessary part of it.

https://www.dw.com/en/middle-east-2023-war-instead-of-era-of-peace/a-67827920,POLITICS,Middle East 2023: War instead of 'era of peace' 28.12.2023,"Before the October 7 attacks, one could have thought that many leaders of the Arab world had forgotten about the Palestinians.
Political calculations, above all the two-state-solution with an independent Palestinian state, seemed to be of little concern any longer.
Priorities had apparently shifted away from the Palestinians and, remarkably, toward Israel.
In 2020, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan signed normalization agreements with Israel.
Also, talks with Saudi Arabia seemed to put Israel well on the way to peace with the influential neighbor to its south. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, all of this heralded an ""era of peace.""
But then came the October 7 attacks by the militant organization Hamas, which is classified as a terrorist organization in Germany, the EU, the US and by several other governments. Hamas fighters killed around 1,200 Israeli citizens and kidnapped some 250 people. Around half have been released since, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
In turn, Israel launched airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, and a ground offensive began at the end of October. Israel has accused Hamas of installing its military infrastructure in areas inhabited or used by civilians.
The Hamas-run Health Ministry has since put the number of deaths in the Gaza Strip at more than 21,000.
Meanwhile, many Arab states have expressed their solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, for example, said the war that Israel is waging against Hamas in the Gaza Strip is a ""blatant aggression"" against Palestinian civilians and threatens to destabilize the entire Middle East. By blocking the supply of food, medicine and fuel, he said, Israel was committing ""war crimes.""
As of now, the Hamas terror attacks did at least achieve one thing: The Palestinians and their concerns have returned to regional and international agendas. The Middle East conflict, which has remained unresolved for more than 70 years, is now back in the spotlight.
""Arab states are driven by their own stability concerns,"" said Andre Bank, Middle East researcher at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies, a Hamburg-based think tank.
Israel's direct neighbors Jordan and Egypt both signed peace treaties with Israel decades ago. They now fear, however, that a further escalation in Gaza or the occupied West Bank might lead to a major displacement of Palestinians which could then lead to unrest in their own countries.
""As a result, demonstrations are allowed in Egypt, but not on Cairo's Tahrir Square, which was the center of the democracy movement in 2011,"" Bank told DW, adding that ""[Egyptian] President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi is worried that such protests could turn into demonstrations of solidarity in the spirit of the Arab Spring.""
In Jordan, pro-Palestinian protests are allowed, however, not near the border with the West Bank. ""The concern is that protests there could easily get out of control,"" said Bank.
In the Gulf states, though, there have hardly been any protests so far. This is consistent with the Emirates' positioning, Bank told DW. The UAE even sided with Israel, at least initially, he added.
The small state of Qatar — some of the Hamas leadership live in the Qatari capital, Doha — has publicly criticized Israel several times. However, in an interview with the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung at the end of November, Qatar's head of government, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, described his country's relationship with Israel as ""pragmatic.""
""We in Qatar have repeatedly said that the problems are the occupation and the Palestinian issue, there is no other problem than that,"" he said. If a solution to these issues is not found, the region would forever be trapped in a cycle of violence, Al Thani added. ""Otherwise, why should we have a problem with Israel if this is seriously addressed?""
But experts doubt the rapprochement between Israel and the Arab world will remain deadlocked.
Johannes Becke, professor of Israel and Middle East Studies at the Heidelberg University of Jewish Studies, told DW that ""harsh rhetoric was expressed at the summit of Arab-Muslim states in Riyadh at the beginning of November, but it also stopped right there.""
The main reasons for this, he said, are the economic and geostrategic interests of Arab states with regard to Israel that remain largely untouched by the conflict in Gaza.
Israel is generally regarded as highly attractive partner for business and technology. Rapprochement with Israel also brings advantages in relations with the United States and other Western countries, he said.
Furthermore, Israel is an important geostrategic partner for those countries that — like the Gulf states — also want to see Iran's influence in the region limited.
""Saudi Arabia improved its relations with Iran in 2023,"" said Becke. However, the rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Israel, which until the Hamas attacks appeared to be rapid, seems to be on hold for the time being due to the war in Gaza.
However, when Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen started firing missiles toward Israel in early December to support Hamas in its fight against Israel, Saudi Arabia took action and intercepted the missiles.
""Until recently, these missiles were fired towards Saudi Arabia itself and may also be aimed at the kingdom again,"" said Becke. ""In this sense, the geopolitical arguments in favor of an Arab-Israeli rapprochement remain unchanged, rather on the contrary, the Hamas attack may even have strengthened them.""
Still, the ongoing pro-Palestinian rallies in the Arab and Islamic world demonstrate the mobilization potential of the war. This is precisely why Arab governments are likely to be interested in ending it as quickly and as permanently as possible, before the protests jeopardize their own stability.
However, rapprochement with Israel may only be resumed after the war, and once the Palestinians benefit from of a new version of the two-state solution. In the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung interview, Qatar's head of government Al-Thani already outlined the framework for this: ""The Palestinian issue can no longer be swept under the carpet,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/colorado-republicans-appeal-trump-ballot-ban-case/a-67838693,POLITICS,Colorado Republicans appeal Trump ballot ban case 28.12.2023,"The Colorado Republican Party Thursday asked the US Supreme Court to overturn a state court ruling that disqualifies former President Donald Trump from running for presidency in the state.
The Supreme Court ruled earlier this month that Trump was ineligible for presidency over his role in the events leading up to the January 6 attack on the Capitol building in Washington DC.
It was the very first ruling of its kind because Colorado's top court concluded that Trump was disqualified under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars people who ""engaged in insurrection"" from holding office.
The US Supreme Court has never ruled on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which was added to the Constitution after the Civil War to prevent former Confederates from returning to government.
Trump has also said he plans to appeal the ruling to US Supreme Court. The US Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority, including three Trump appointees.

Trump has emerged as the Republican Party's front-runner in the 2024 election.
""The Colorado Supreme Court has removed the leading Republican candidate from the primary and general ballots, fundamentally changing the course of American democracy,"" the Colorado Republican Party's attorneys wrote in the court filing. 
""Unless the Colorado Supreme Court's decision is overturned, any voter will have the power to sue to disqualify any political candidate, in Colorado or in any other jurisdiction that follows its lead. This will not only distort the 2024 presidential election but will also mire courts henceforth in political controversies over nebulous accusations of insurrection.""
The Colorado Supreme Court ruling reversed a district court judge's conclusion that Trump engaged in insurrection by inciting his supporters to violence. The judge, however, said the president was not an ""officer of the United States"" who could be disqualified under the 14th Amendment.
The state Supreme Court didn't agree that the presidency is exempt from disqualification.
The first impact of the appeal is to extend the ruling from Colorado's highest court, which put its decision on pause until January 4, the day before the state's primary ballots are due at the printer.

https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-rwanda-plan-conservatives-debate-migration-reform/a-67833652,POLITICS,Germany's Rwanda plan: Conservatives debate migration reform 27.12.2023,"The conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) put the plans for sending asylum-seekers to third countries into the draft of its new ""basic principles program"" in early December. The document is to be approved in 2024.
Following the publication of the draft, CDU lawmaker Jens Spahn insisted that such plans would drastically reduce the amount of ""irregular immigration"" to Germany. ""If we pull it off consistently for four, six or eight weeks, the numbers would go down dramatically,"" Spahn told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung before Christmas.
Spahn said the plans would deter migrants from attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea, and argued that several countries would be willing to make deals to process migrants. ""Rwanda would probably be willing,"" Spahn said. ""Ghana might be, too. We should also talk to Eastern European countries such as Georgia and Moldova.""
Spahn's comments come even though the United Kingdom's deal with Rwanda, signed in 2022, hit a legal roadblock in November, when Britain's Supreme Court ruled that ""the removal of the claimants to Rwanda would expose them to a real risk of ill-treatment."" The court found that there was no way of guaranteeing that the Rwandan asylum system was fair and humane.
The British government is pressing ahead with the plan, insisting that, with a few amendments, it can be made legal — and has since signed a new deal with Rwanda. However, the United Kingdom has already paid Rwanda over £240 million ($300 million/€280 million) with another £50 million due next year, and has yet to transport a single migrant there.
Among other issues, the UK Supreme Court found that government ministers had failed to properly examine evidence from the United Nations Refugee Agency, the UNHCR, about a similar deal that Israel had made with Rwanda in 2013.
Denmark has also been in talks with Rwanda's government to introduce such a plan, though no deal has been signed because Denmark is hoping to put the plan together with other EU countries. Last week, the European Union presented a plan that would aim to process asylum-seekers directly at the EU's external borders and deport them from there if so determined.

Migration researcher Gerald Knaus told DW that, though the CDU's draft plan is a little vague, the idea would discourage people from taking dangerous migration routes.
""Rwanda participates on the assumption that, if you have a credible safe-third-country policy, people will stop crossing certain routes because it makes no sense, and then the number of transfers will also decrease,"" he said.
""What the UK courts have done is show how you do not do this,"" said Knaus, who believes that Germany's government could learn a lot from the court rulings, and that the Rwanda scheme is at least more humane than the far right's proposals. ""The details are everything, and these judgments have been incredibly helpful because they said: Such a policy can work, but you must be serious about it.""
The idea of processing asylum-seekers abroad isn't new. Germany's center-left-led government pledged in its 2021 coalition agreement to ""examine whether the determination of protection status is possible in exceptional cases in third countries in compliance with the Refugee Convention and the ECHR [European Court of Human Rights].""
But there are different models for how this can be achieved, and, according to some experts, the Rwanda scheme is one of the least viable, both legally and logistically.
A more realistic model might have been presented by the deal that Italy and Albania signed in November, which will see migrants picked up in international waters in the Mediterranean Sea transported to Albania, where they can submit asylum applications.
Though questions have been raised about the legal and ethical implications, the Italy-Albania agreement does include some safeguards: Women, children and people in exceptional need are exempt, as are people who have already entered Italian waters. Also, the applications in Albania will be processed by Italian officials, who Italy has said will be bound by EU asylum law.
Both people whose asylum applications are successful and those whose applications are rejected would be taken back to Italy, where successful applicants would be allowed to settle. Rejected applicants would be deported from Italy.

Despite the stated safeguards, Lorenzo Piccoli, a researcher of migration policy with the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies in Italy, said ""there are strong reasons to doubt the efficacy of such plans that are extremely costly and affect a relatively small number of people.""
One of those reasons is that, according to a 2018 study by the European Commission, it's not at all clear whether EU law can be applied outside of the bloc, as Italy claims. Secondly, it is unclear how Italy would manage the logistics of selecting from among traumatized migrants on ships in international waters, sailing some of them to Italy, and others for two more days to Albania.
Another proposal for processing asylum applications in third countries is already in place: the UNHCR's resettlement program, which processes asylum applications in transit countries such as Jordan. Once applications have been approved, the UNHCR finds countries willing to take in successful applicants, which is where the difficulty lies. According to the UNHCR, more than 1.4 million people were in need of resettlement in 2021, of whom only 63,000 were resettled. The projected global settlement need for 2023 is more than 2 million people.
Piccoli said the Rwanda plan was more political than practical. ""By showing that they want to make conditions harder for those who seek asylum, political parties want to score political goals,"" he said.
""Practically, as we have seen with the deal between the United Kingdom and Rwanda, these proposals are legally dubious and unlikely to bring about any meaningful change in the number of people who travel to a country,"" Piccoli said.

https://www.dw.com/en/poland-puts-state-media-into-liquidation-amid-political-row/a-67836396,MEDIA,Poland puts state media into liquidation amid political row 27.12.2023,"Poland's new culture minister announced the liquidation of all public media on Wednesday, deepening a political rift over the state-run broadcasters. The move, however, does not mean public broadcasters will be dissolved.
After taking power earlier this month, the new pro-EU government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk started an overhaul of state media outlets. Many critics of the previous government, which was led by the nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS), claim the broadcasters were reduced to the mouthpieces of the PiS and its allies during their eight-year rule.
But the push to reform them faced an obstacle when Poland's conservative President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, vetoed the new government's budget for public media.
""Due to the decision of the President of the Republic of Poland to suspend financing of public media, I decided to put into liquidation the companies Telewizja Polska SA, Polskie Radio SA and Polska Agencja Prasowa SA,"" Culture Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz said on social media on Wednesday.
""In the current situation, such action will ensure the continued operation of these companies, carry out the necessary restructuring and prevent layoffs of employees in the above-mentioned companies.""
Putting the public TV, radio and news agency into liquidation helps protect the organizations as they are deprived of funding due to the ongoing political dispute, the minister said. Specifically, it secures workers' jobs and allows for restructuring, according to the official.
Sienkiewicz also noted that the lengthy liquidation process can be revoked as needed.
Poland's state-owned media outlets have become the first battleground between Tusk's coalition government and PiS and its allies.
The head of Duda's office, Marin Mastalerek, accused the new culture minister of behaving like ""a typical aggressor.""
Separately, PiS lawmaker Joanna Lichocka claimed that ""Tusk's government is destroying the Polish media.""
But the new government has defended its agenda.
""We are sure that our actions are in line with the law,"" Tusk told a news conference on Wednesday.

https://www.dw.com/en/jacques-delors-was-the-bold-engineer-of-the-european-union/a-67835761,POLITICS,Jacques Delors was the bold engineer of the European Union 27.12.2023,"Jacques Delors, a former head of the European Commission and key figure in the creation of the euro currency, died in his sleep in his Paris home at the age of 98, his family announced on Wednesday.
Marked by World War II and its horrors, the generation Delors grew up in developed a creative, formative determination — a determination that drove Delors, as president of the European Commission from 1985 to 1995, to lay the foundations of the modern EU.

Within half a year of taking office in January 1985, Delors presented his masterpiece, the White Paper on the Completion of the Single Market, and worked energetically to implement it by the end of 1992. The fact that Europeans today are free to settle and look for work anywhere in Europe, employ a worker from a neighboring country or easily buy products from all over the bloc is all thanks to this white paper.
And his political legacy jingles in our wallets. Every day, around 341 million Europeans pay with the euro currency. Few among them will know that the euro was conceived in a brief, 38-page report by Delors in 1989 that laid the foundation for European economic and monetary union.

But Delors didn't just have friends among the EU heads of state and government. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's response to Delors' proposals for European institutional reform was a scathing ""No, no, no""; the two clashed fiercely on numerous occasions.
When the heads of state and government bade him farewell at his last official EU summit in December 1994, they were full of praise, and attributed ""the 10 most successful years of European unification"" to him.
Delors was born on July 20, 1925, in Paris and grew up in modest circumstances as an only child. In 1948, he married Marie Lephaille and the couple had a daughter, Martine, and a son, Jean-Paul. Martine Aubry followed in her father's footsteps, entering political life and becoming mayor of Lille. Jean-Paul died of leukemia in 1982, and Marie died in 2020.
Delors began his career at the Banque de France. In 1974 Delors, who had studied law and economics, joined his first political party, France's new Socialist Party. He rose relatively quickly to join the party's executive committee, and arrived in Brussels in 1979 as a member of the European Parliament.
In 1981, Delors left Brussels to serve as economics and finance minister to French President Francois Mitterrand. It was Mitterrand who successfully proposed him for the post of European Commission president in 1985.


In 1995, after completing his term in office as European Commission president, Delors did not, as anticipated, stand as a candidate for the French presidency. He had no intention of retiring, though, and instead became involved with UNESCO and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In 1996 he started his own foundation, Notre Europe, also known as the Jacques Delors Institute, through which he would frequently comment on the work of European unification.
After the deaths of Jean Monnet and Helmut Kohl, that of Jacques Delors marks the passing of the last of only three Honorary Citizens of Europe, a title bestowed in recognition of extraordinary work to promote European cooperation.
Delors, a courageous and pragmatic thinker who was ahead of his time, constructed the European Union in its present form, with all its strengths and weaknesses.

https://www.dw.com/en/wolfgang-sch%C3%A4uble-a-veteran-heavyweight-of-german-politics/a-67830479,POLITICS,Wolfgang Schäuble: A veteran heavyweight of German politics 27.12.2023,"Born in 1942, Wolfgang Schäuble was something of the embodiment of Germany's political history, first that of West Germany and then the reunited country. The Christian Democrat was a member of the Bundestag continuously since 1972 — a record in the roughly 150-year history of German nationwide parliaments. A life without politics was unimaginable for Schäuble. 
""I am a parliamentarian out of passion,"" he always said. When asked in an interview how it felt to have shaped politics in the Bundestag for half a century, Schäuble replied with a touch of his typical intellectual irony: ""You can see how much fun politics is.""
Wolfgang Schäuble died on December 26, 2023 at the age of 81.
Two key moments shaped Schäuble's political and private life. The first was an attempted assassination in 1990, which put him in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
A decade later, he had to relinquish the chairmanship of the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and with it the prospect of one day becoming German chancellor.

The son of a CDU local politician from Freiburg, Schäuble studied economics and became a lawyer with a doctorate. In 1984, the newly-elected Chancellor Helmut Kohl called him to the center of government in Bonn. Schäuble became the head of the Federal Chancellery and with that, the organizer of power. Everything went through him.
In 1989, Schäuble became Germany's interior minister and the events of that year catapulted him into the limelight. After the fall of the Berlin Wall , he played a key role in negotiating the reunification of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).
Only a few weeks later, on October 12, 1990, he was shot by a man with mental illness at an election meeting. Schäuble sustained life-threatening injuries, and was paralyzed from the third vertebra downwards. He had to use a wheelchair for the rest of his life, but giving up wasn't an option.
Schäuble once recalled that he did not bemoan his fate for too long, saying to himself ""I cannot change what happened, but as long as I live, I'll live."" Six weeks after the attack, he gave his first press conference from his new wheelchair.
In 1998, Schäuble became chairman of the CDU. Chancellor Kohl stressed repeatedly that he wanted Schäuble to be his successor, but it didn't turn out that way in the end.
Toward the end of 1999, it became known that during Kohl's term illegal donations had been made to the party, and the existence of secret bank accounts were revealed . A few weeks later, Schäuble admitted to having received 100,000 deutsche marks for the illicit CDU accounts from an arms dealer. He resigned as party chairman — a ""massive blow,"" Schäuble said in an interview with the Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung.
In the years when the CDU was in opposition, from 1998 to 2005, Schäuble concentrated on foreign and security policy.
In the CDU-led grand coalition government from 2005, Schäuble became interior minister and then finance minister. ""A tough dog,"" was how the opposition described him. For example, Schäuble supported an aviation security law that would have made it possible to shoot down an aircraft that had been hijacked by terrorists. The proposal ultimately failed.
When he was finance minister, the coalition government — of the Christian Democrats, the CDU's Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union, and the neoliberal Free Democrats — enacted the biggest austerity package in the history of modern Germany. During the uncertainty that arose in 2009 about the future of the common euro currency, Schäuble became a bogeyman for many Greeks because he prescribed strict austerity measures for the country.
In October 2017, Schäuble became president of Germany's federal parliament, the Bundestag. Symbolically, it's the second-highest political position in the country.
In this role, he was respected as one of parliament's best speakers. With his sharp mind, his deep fundamental understanding of German democracy and his humor, he led Bundestag sessions like no other. The ""passionate parliamentarian"" seemed to have found his dream job and was reconciled with the intrigues of power that he had repeatedly experienced up close.
Schäuble confidently forced even the far-right populist and rebellious Alternative for Germany (AfD) to comply with parliamentary conventions — with sharp objections, reprimands and fines. Even former Chancellor Angela Merkel was not immune from his rebuke if she exceeded her speaking time. He was the undisputed authority in parliament.  

And Schäuble remained a relevant figure, even when he returned to the German Bundestag as a ""regular lawmaker"" after the September 2021 election.
Schäuble remained a conservative political visionary well into his senior years, always looking for an intellectual challenge. In early 2021, he published a book titled ""Borderline Experiences: How We Grow in Crises."" The book is something of a credo for his life as a politician. It shows Schäuble's curiosity, his delight in arguments and his fun in innovation.
During the COVID pandemic, Schäuble saw an opportunity to overcome the ""immobility"" in Germany. ""Many people in our country feel that change is needed,"" he said.
One of his quotes sums him up well: ""We have the freedom to make the world we live in better, to be able to achieve great things."" It was something that Schäuble believed in his whole life.
This article was originally written in German.
Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that in 1999 ""Schäuble admitted to having received €100,000 for the illicit CDU accounts from an arms dealer."" The euro did not exist yet at the time, and Germany's currency was the deutsche mark. This article has been updated to reflect the correction.

https://www.dw.com/en/war-in-ukraine-sparks-german-rethink-on-defense-security/a-67791818,POLITICS,"War in Ukraine sparks German rethink on defense, security 27.12.2023","The experts agree: Armed conflict elsewhere will continue to shape life in Germany in the coming year. Questions of war and peace will influence more and more political decisions because, ever since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the possibility that Russia could attack NATO territory has grown more likely.
Take road construction — just one example among many, as political scientist Christian Mölling told DW. Roads and bridges in Germany, he said, would have to be upgraded because many current roadways and bridges are not designed to support the weight of tanks and other heavy military equipment.  
Mölling, director of the Center for Security and Defense at the German Council on Foreign Relations, recently presented a report that rang alarm bells among Berlin's political elite. The report demonstrated that, in the worst case, NATO countries only have five years to rearm, or else the alliance would no longer have the military power to deter a potential Russian aggression. 
Germany is rapidly entering a new era. For three decades following the fall of the Iron Curtain, Germans trusted that the end of the Cold War had also banished the threat of a major armed conflict. Those days are over, now that Ukraine is experiencing war on its own soil.  
Political considerations that Germany forgot after the fall of the Berlin Wall are now back on the agenda. ""A comprehensive defense policy demands especially that civilian infrastructure and society itself be made resilient enough to withstand a war,"" said Mölling. That could lend military significance to the municipal planning of a new road bridge, especially if the bridge in question would play a strategic role in a war situation.  
Mölling sees an opportunity in the looming effort. He argues that, to restore its overall defense, Germany must ""suspend certain regulations for a period of time. In the paper we characterized it as: More investment, less regulation.""  

Yet people in Germany have a problem coping with the new realities. It has been nearly two years since Chancellor Olaf Scholz's historic speech in parliament announcing ""a turning of the times,"" or ""Zeitenwende,"" a term meant to underscore that military policy and Germany's defense capabilities had again become a priority, as they were when the Berlin Wall was still standing.    
Most German security analysts and defense experts, including Mölling, have said Ukraine is defending the rest of Europe's freedom, and even more. If Russia defeats Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin will continue to wage war and eventually attack NATO itself, they said.
But when they were asked about where Germany should cut spending in these times of nearly empty state coffers, 54% of Germans surveyed in an ARD-Deutschlandtrend poll replied aid for Ukraine. In another opinion poll, however, conducted by public broadcaster ZDF, more than 70% said Ukraine should continue to receive weapons, or even greater amounts of military equipment. 
Mölling sees this contradiction reflected in government policy. ""Many people, not least in Germany, fail to understand that in defense matters, you cannot push a button and then have tanks rolling off assembly lines the next day,"" he said.
""It simply takes a long, long time before these kinds of production capacities are established. Germany's government and governments across Europe can justifiably be accused of not having seen the signs of the times and begun producing much more,"" he added. ""Not because Ukraine needs it, but because we do, too.""
These realities have gained even more urgency when factoring in the possibility of a US presidential comeback for Donald Trump, who, some fear, could pull the US out of NATO altogether.
""We must prepare now,"" and not just once it happens, Moritz Schularick, director of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, told DW. The think tank publishes a ""Ukraine Support Tracker"" of international military and financial aid to Ukraine, a recent update of which showed that Germany is now the second-most important arms provider to Ukraine after the US.
Yet Germany's military production capacity has not risen significantly, as Mölling pointed out. ""We are only plugging gaps. We have not begun to build up the production capacities we will need to meet the deadlines set down in our paper,"" he said.

""Contrary to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, we saw an effort from the African leadership to respond as a bloc [to the conflict in Gaza],"" Fredson Guilengue, a Johannesburg-based analyst with the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation, which is affiliated with Germany's socialist Left party, told DW.
Support by African countries for the UN General Assembly's March 2, 2022 resolution demanding Russia's withdrawal from Ukraine was relatively weak. Just 28 of Africa's 54 member states voted in favor, while 17 abstained and eight didn't vote. Eritrea, a dictatorship, voted against the resolution.
Yet many African countries have emphatically and consistently called for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, said Alex Vines, head of the Africa program at the Chatham House policy institute in London. ""There have been very few countries in the African continent that have taken a pro Israeli stance,"" he said.
The African Union was quick to side with the Palestinians, with AU Commission Chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat appealing to both sides to cease hostilities. 
""The chairperson wishes to recall that denial of the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people, particularly that of an independent and sovereign state, is the main cause of the permanent Israeli-Palestinian tension,"" he said in a statement on October 7, the same day that Hamas, which is classified as a terror group by the US, EU and other governments, attacked communities within Israel. Later it became clear that Hamas had killed nearly 1,200 people and taken about 240 hostages.
Some African countries have expressed support for Israel, said Guilengue. Kenya, Ghana, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo have shown solidarity with Israel and explicitly condemned Hamas. In Kenya, for example, President William Ruto spoke out strongly against terrorism and attacks on innocent civilians, despite criticism from opposition politicians, who called for relations with Israel to be severed.
Other countries, South Africa in particular, have taken a pro-Palestinian position, said Guilengue. The country did not openly condemn Hamas and blames Israel for the escalation of the conflict. In late November, South African parliamentarians voted to break off diplomatic relations, though the decision is not binding for the government. 
The government has called on the International Criminal Court in The Hague to investigate whether Israel has committed war crimes in the Gaza Strip, repeatedly comparing the country's military response to the Hamas attacks to genocide.
Guilengue said these reactions had to do with South Africa's history of apartheid, which many there compare to conditions and events in Gaza. Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor has repeatedly stated that South Africa will not be drawn into taking sides, but has criticized the West for selectively condemning Russia while ignoring other acts of aggression such as the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.
People across Africa have long shown solidarity with Palestinians, said Gilles Yabi, the head of Wathi, a think tank in Senegal that is focused on West Africa. A sense of a shared history of colonialism plays a major role in that stance. Many governments across Africa support establishing a Palestinian state that could exist alongside Israel, Yabi said recently in his podcast for the International Crisis Group.
The countries that have allied themselves with Israel are motivated by other factors, such as military and economic support from the country and its allies, Guilengue said.
""They actually don't want to show a position that will go against the interest of Israel,"" he said, ""because it might also mean going against the interest of the United States and the West.""
Though Russia does not have a presence in Africa on a par with that of the most powerful European countries and the United States, it is still valued as a partner by many countries.
Some African governments consider Russia's war against Ukraine to be a matter of European security interests. Over the course of 2023, African countries have increasingly decided that they don't want to be pigeonholed in their response to global crises. ""They don't want to be pro-Western, pro-Chinese or pro-Russian,"" said Chatham House expert Vines.
As such, the number of votes for Russia in the UN General Assembly has fallen significantly. ""Many African countries are increasingly voting a la carte on these issues,"" said Vines. 

African countries have stood strong against diplomatic pressure over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, said Guilengue. Despite visits by high-ranking representatives of Russia and Western nations, governments across Africa have insisted on a largely impartial position, relying on peace mediators. The AU, including South Africa, sent delegations to Russia and Ukraine after the outbreak of the war to propose ways to settle the conflict.
This is in keeping with African governments' attempting to take a more active role in global diplomacy, while at the same time consolidating the economic importance of players such as China, which offer alternatives for aid and investment.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-ex-finance-minister-wolfgang-sch%C3%A4uble-dies-at-81/a-67829835,POLITICS,Germany: Ex-Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble dies at 81 27.12.2023,"The former speaker of the Bundestag parliament and finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble has died surrounded by his family, who first informed the German DPA news agency of his passing early on Wednesday. 

Schäuble died peacefully at around 8 p.m. on Tuesday night, his family said.
A veteran leading member of the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), Schäuble was born in Freiburg, the southwestern German state of Baden-Württemberg, in 1942.
He entered parliament in 1972 and directly reclaimed his Offenburg constituency in every subsequent election, making him the longest-serving parliamentarian in Germany's postwar history.

He was probably at his most prominent internationally during the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent eurozone sovereign debt difficulties, when he was Germany’s fiscally hawkish finance minister calling on southern European countries to limit their borrowing.
He became a renowned, and often reviled, figure in countries like Greece during this period.
This is reflected in comments made by Yanis Varoufakis, Greece's finance minister in the first half of 2015, who negotiated on the part of Athens during the Greek debt crisis from 2009 to 2018.
""Wolfgang Schäuble was the embodiment of the political project of buttressing a monetary union in which he himself did not believe,"" Varoufakis wrote after the news of Schäuble's death. ""History will judge him harshly, but no more harshly than those who succumbed to his disastrous project and policies.""
But at one point, Schäuble also appeared to be next in line to follow Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Germany's top political job.
He had served in a series of government positions including as interior minister. That was the role he held in 1990, when an assassination attempt and gunshot wounds confined him to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. 

He is survived by his wife Ingeborg and four children. You can read our full obituary here. 
Current CDU leader Friedrich Merz was among the first politicians to respond to the news on Wednesday. He said Schäuble's death ""fills me with great sadness.""
""In Wolfgang Schäuble, I lose my closest friend and confidant that I ever had in politics,"" Merz said on social media, signing with his initials to indicate he had authored the post. ""My thoughts are with his family, in particular his wife Ingeborg.""
Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat who succeeded Schäuble as finance minister in 2018, said he had ""shaped our country for more than half a century,"" as a parliamentarian, minister and as speaker of parliament.  
""In him Germany is losing a bright thinker, passionate politician and strident democrat,"" Scholz said. 
Veteran Green politician Katrin Göring-Eckhardt posted a lengthy tribute, saying the country was losing a ""passionate defender of our parliamentary democracy,"" who she said she grew to respect greatly despite ""differing political convictions."" 
""I valued his strengths in debate, his persistence, not always insisting but always being open to remaining in discussions, on a high and challenging level,"" Göring-Eckhardt said, praising his decades of political service.
The Central Council of Jews in Germany also posted a tribute, calling the 81-year-old ""a close friend of the Jewish community in Germany.""

https://www.dw.com/en/fbi-probes-threats-to-colorado-judges-in-trump-ballot-case/a-67828470,POLITICS,FBI probes threats to Colorado judges in Trump ballot case 27.12.2023,"Denver police on Tuesday said they were investigating possible threats against state Supreme Court justices.
Last week, the court blocked former US President Donald Trump from the state's presidential primary ballot.
""The Denver Police Department is currently investigating incidents directed at Colorado Supreme Court justices and will continue working with our local, state, and federal law enforcement partners to thoroughly investigate any reports of threats or harassment,"" police said in a statement on Tuesday.
The FBI said it was assisting local law enforcement in the investigation.
""We will vigorously pursue investigations of any threat or use of violence committed by someone who uses extremist views to justify their actions regardless of motivation,"" a spokesperson for the Denver's FBI office said in a statement.
The justices ruled 4-3 on December 19 that Trump should be disqualified for engaging in insurrection.
After two days, Denver police were called to one of the justice's homes in what was later described as a hoax report. The incident is still being investigated.
The decision by Colorado's top court overturned a ruling from a district court judge who found that Trump incited an insurrection for his role in the January 6 attack on the Capitol.
However, it said he could not be barred from the ballot because it was unclear that the US Constitution's insurrection clause was intended to cover the presidency.
The state Supreme Court didn't agree, and stayed its decision until January 4, or until the US Supreme Court makes a ruling on the case. Colorado officials say the issue must be settled by January 5, which is the deadline for the state to print its presidential primary ballots.
Some media outlets such as NBC News have since reported there has been a rise in violent rhetoric on online forums, directed at the four judges who ruled against Trump.
Reports said the posts had shared the judges' personal information, and calls for violence against them.
Trump has recently increased making inflammatory remarks against his opposers, and posted a Christmas Day message on his Truth Social platform calling on his political opponents to ""rot in hell.""
On Tuesday, he posted a poll on Truth Social saying that the word voters most associate with a potential second term under his command is ""revenge.""
Trump became the first candidate in US history deemed ineligible for the White House under a provision of the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution which prohibits officials who engage in ""insurrection or rebellion"" against the US government from holding elected office.

https://www.dw.com/en/pakistans-economic-security-woes-fuel-election-apathy/a-67824095,POLITICS,"Pakistan's economic, security woes fuel election apathy 26.12.2023","There is hardly any pre-election hustle-bustle in Karachi, Pakistan's financial hub, although it is now almost certain that polls scheduled for February 8 won't be delayed.   
There are multiple reasons behind a lack of interest in the upcoming general elections among the public; the foremost being an ongoing crackdown on ex-PM Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. 
Khan and many of his aides are behind bars in several cases, and it is unlikely that they will be released before the elections. These measures have made the upcoming vote quite controversial. 
Also, Pakistan has been in a state of economic turmoil for almost two years. The skyrocketing inflation has rendered the masses incapable of buying even basic food items and paying electricity bills, among other problems. As most citizens struggle to make ends meet, they are less bothered about who will form the next government. 

The country's security issues remain a big concern for its military leadership, with a spike in the number of militant attacks in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces bordering Afghanistan.
Additionally, the generals are still reeling from the May 9 protests by Imran Khan's supporters that saw some rioters attacking military installations and residential areas. 
The mistrust between state institutions is so high that the upcoming polls are no longer about which party wins most seats in the next parliament; they are about Pakistan's survival as a modern state, many people say. 
The imminent elections are all about one man: the former cricket star-turned-politician Imran Khan. He is currently incarcerated over charges related to corruption and leaking state secrets. 
After he was removed from power last year in a parliamentary no-confidence vote, Khan accused the US and some military generals of orchestrating his ouster. The former premier, who according to many polls remains the most popular politician in the country, raised the stakes so high that at one point earlier this year, state institutions came into clash with each other, and some sections of the masses in direct confrontation with the military — something the country had never witnessed in the past.

For some, Khan's disruptive politics is necessary to weaken the generals' grip on power; for others, it is a dangerous scenario for a country that has an economy on the verge of collapse and is facing many geopolitical challenges. 
""Politics of polarization by any popular leader is harmful in any country as it detracts from attending to key reforms and development,"" Adnan Rehmat, an Islamabad-based journalist and analyst, told DW. ""Sadly, Imran Khan excels at politics of hate and incendiary rhetoric. In a politically and socially plural country such as Pakistan, political polarization stifles engagement and collaboration needed for solving lingering problems."" 
Rehmat is of the view that Khan has become a victim of ""his own politics of hate,"" and now nobody wants to defend his rights. 
Pakistan's economy is possibly the biggest casualty of the protracted political instability. Even though the economic indicators weren't very positive during Khan's tenure (2018-2022), they nosedived since Khan's removal from power. 
""Those on low incomes have been hit the hardest by economic difficulties, with many experiencing job losses and reduced earnings. As a result, they have had to cut back on the amount and quality of food they can afford, seek out less expensive transportation options, and work multiple jobs to make ends meet,"" The Lancet journal underlined in September, adding that ""financial mismanagement and political instability, stemming from military interventions, have further worsened the economic crisis."" 
DW has seen long queues outside bakeries and supermarkets, and scores of homeless people sleeping along roadsides in Karachi. 
Pakistan's inflation rose to a record 31.4% in September, with particularly high energy prices. 
Some people here are of the view that only an elected government with a popular mandate can remedy these economic woes, but Akhter Mohammadi, a tea seller in Karachi's Tariq Road area, says the country needs to be put on the right track first. 
""I will definitely vote (in upcoming elections). I will vote for Maulana Fazal-ur-Rahman (an Islamic cleric) because the economy can only be fixed if Pakistan is politically stable,"" Mohammadi told DW. 

""There is little doubt that the PTI will win big if the elections were held in a fair manner. This is why the powers-that-be are denying it a level playing field. However, ultimately, it is not votes won but seats secured in the legislature that determine who will come to power. In this sense, the deck is stacked against the PTI,"" analyst Rehmat underlined. 
Experts believe the voter turnout would be low — possibly the lowest in Pakistan's election history. 
""The critical factor for the turnout will be whether Khan's supporters come out to vote on election day or not,"" Rehmat said. 
Right now, that looks very unlikely.

https://www.dw.com/en/why-the-south-china-sea-was-turbulent-in-2023/a-67758940,CONFLICTS,Why the South China Sea was turbulent in 2023 26.12.2023,"On December 10, a flotilla of 40 boats set off from the Philippine coastal town of El Nido in Palawan province to a group of islets and shoals in the South China Sea called the Spratly Islands, parts of which are claimed by several countries. 
More than 200 volunteers on this ""Christmas convoy"" wanted to deliver donated gifts and supplies to poor fishers living and working on boats in the Spratly archipelago, as well as to troops manning a purposely-grounded World War II-era vessel rusting away on a shoal that serves as a small Filipino territorial outpost.
The convoy was organized by a coalition called ""Atin Ito"" meaning ""This is Ours"" in Filipino. Besides bringing holiday cheer, organizers said they wanted to show the Philippines' presence in the Spratlys.
As the flotilla was making the crossing, they received word that the Chinese coast guard had confronted another nearby supply mission with water cannons, causing serious damage to one of the boats' engines.
And after being ""shadowed"" themselves by the Chinese coast guard, the organizers turned the flotilla back to El Nido.
The incident is only the latest in an ongoing standoff that has escalated this year between the Philippines and China over disputed islets and shoals in the South China Sea, a resource-rich waterway claimed almost entirely by China.
For months, much larger and more modern Chinese coast guard vessels have been regularly confronting the Filipino coast guard, navy and fishing boats, sometimes ramming into them, and in one case earlier this year, using ""military-grade lasers"" to disorient crew.
The Chinese coast guard can patrol these waters off the west coast of the Philippines up to 24 hours a day from bases on artificial islands, built between 2014 and 2017 by dredging sand onto reefs and rocks.
One of these at Mischief Reef in the Spratlys is only 37 kilometers (23 miles) from the shipwreck outpost at Second Thomas Shoal, called Ayungin Shoal by the Philippines.
While it was building artificial islands, China also put together the largest coast guard in the world, which boasts decommissioned naval ships that rival the size of US destroyers.
China ""now forward deploys dozens of coast guard and hundreds of militia boats in the Spratly Islands, 800 miles from the Chinese coast, around the clock,"" said Greg Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington.
To the north of the Spratlys is another disputed hot spot at Scarborough Shoal, a turquoise lagoon ringed by shallow reefs and rocks located about 120 nautical miles (222 kilometers) west of the Philippine island of Luzon. It is home to rich fishing grounds where Filipino fishermen play cat-and-mouse with Chinese coast guard boats.
China has bristled at the Philippines attempting to challenge Beijing's self-declared ""indisputable sovereignty"" over the shallow reef and rocks it calls ""Huangyan Dao"" and has occupied since 2012.

Scarborough Shoal is more than 460 nautical miles (851 kilometers) from the nearest Chinese shore at Hainan Island, and is well within the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
In September, the Philippines infuriated China by removing a floating barrier the Chinese coast guard had set up in front of the lagoon entrance.
And the day before the Spratly Christmas convoy was being harassed by the Chinese coast guard, another Philippine supply mission to dozens of fishermen in the waters around Scarborough Shoal was attacked with Chinese water cannons, damaging vessels.
However, according to international law, there is no ""legal"" basis for Beijing's sweeping territorial claims under its so-called ""nine-dash line,"" which is seen on maps protruding in a U-shaped tongue hundreds of miles south and cutting across the EEZs of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei.
In 2013, the Philippines challenged China's claims at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. The international tribunal ruled in 2016 that China's claims to ""historic rights and resources"" within the nine-dash line had ""no legal basis.""
It also ruled that none of the ""land features"" China claims in the Spratlys could be considered capable of being the basis for legal territorial claims like an EEZ.
Beijing instantly rejected the ruling as ""null and void,"" and has ignored it ever since.

South China Sea historian Bill Hayton has pointed out that the basis for the nine-dash line partly goes back to a 1936 map created by Chinese geographer Bai Meichu, who named and claimed islands that didn't even exist, some based on misinterpretations of permanently submerged sand rises published on existing Western maritime charts.
This includes ""James Shoal"" in the Spratlys, which to this day China says is the southernmost point of the country, even though it is over 21 meters underwater, is located 1,800 kilometers from the Chinese mainland, and is only 80 kilometers off the coast of Malaysia.
""This isn't about economics or resources, it's about nationalism. China's leadership has since the 1990s created its own historical fairy tale about 'historic rights' across these waters, and now it can't let it go even though it has become self-defeating,"" said CSIS expert Poling.
""China seeks to control all peacetime activity in the South China Sea because it has convinced itself that it has that right, and because [Chinese leader] Xi Jinping elevated the importance of this issue to his domestic political legitimacy,"" he added.
Even if they are the result of somebody's imagination, the competing claims in the South China Sea are considered a real threat to security and stability in waterways that carry trillions of dollars in global trade.
The US Navy, among other Western navies, regularly leads ""freedom of navigation"" exercises in the South China Sea as a reminder of this.
After Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took over as Philippine president in June 2022, Manila rekindled its decadeslong defense partnership with the United States and signaled it would be less receptive to Chinese interests than was seen under the previous president, Rodrigo Duterte.
This included holding the largest-ever US-Philippine war games in April in the northern Philippines.
Chinese officials have repeatedly warned the US against intervening in the South China Sea, and consider Western interest in the disputed waters to be an ""external force"" in a strictly Asian affair.

Over the past year, Beijing has also shown it is willing to take larger risks, or at least appear to, in order to drum up domestic support from hardliners.
""Tensions around Second Thomas Shoal, and to a lesser degree Scarborough, have been increasing steadily for the last year as China has sought to block every Filipino resupply mission, and has been doing so with more dangerous tactics — lasers, water cannons, acoustic devices, and outright ramming,"" said Poling.
Philippine security officials fear China's next step could be taking over Second Thomas Shoal and building military installations there, as it did with nearby Mischief Reef, Reuters has reported.
In sending flotillas and supply missions in defiance of China's overwhelming material superiority, the Philippines is testing how far Beijing is willing to go, and whether the frequent attacks on its boats will be limited to water cannons in the future.
""The Philippine government under President Marcos is determined not to back down in the face of bullying, and the US has been clear that it will help defend Filipinos if China uses force,"" said Poling.
He added that the US backing, at least on paper, helps ""give the Philippines more confidence that it can continue to run these Chinese blockades without the Chinese vessels opening fire.""
""So far, that calculation has been correct, leaving China with no good options but to keep running this same dangerous play over and over every month, worsening its relationship with the Philippines and damaging its international reputation to no benefit.""

https://www.dw.com/en/navalny-says-hes-fine-after-arrival-in-arctic-penal-colony/a-67823777,POLITICS,Navalny says he's fine' after arrival in Arctic penal colony 26.12.2023,"Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny said on Tuesday that he was ""fine"" despite a ""pretty exhausting"" transfer to a penal colony in Russia's far north that took 20 days.
""Don't worry about me. I'm fine. I'm totally relieved that I've finally made it,"" he wrote on the messaging platform X, formerly known as Twitter, adding: ""I'm still in a good mood, as befits a Santa Claus"" — a reference to his appearance, with winter clothing and beard grown during the transfer.
Navalny's spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said on Monday that he had been found in the ""Polar Wolf"" colony, officially known as the IK-3 penal colony, in Kharp in the Yamal-Nenets region, about 1,900 km (1,200 miles) northeast of Moscow.
His supporters had lost contact with him for more than two weeks, giving rise to much speculation as to his health and well-being.
""They brought me here on Saturday night. And I was transported with such precaution and on such a strange route (Vladimir — Moscow — Chelyabinsk — Ekaterinburg — Kirov — Vorkuta — Kharp) that I didn't expect anyone to find me here before mid-January,"" Navalny wrote.
""That's why I was very surprised when the cell door was opened yesterday with the words: 'A lawyer is here to see you.' He told me that you had lost me, and some of you were even worried. Thanks very much for your support!"" he added, also ironically speaking of the ""huge fluffy, and very beautiful shepherd dogs"" he had seen at the site.
""Thanks again to everyone for your support. And happy holidays!"" 

The ""Polar Wolf"" colony, located 60 km (40 miles) north of the Arctic Circle, is thought to be one of the harshest in Russia.
Temperatures there are due to drop to around -28 C (-18.4 Fahrenheit) there over the next week.
The colony was founded in the 1960s as part of the system of forced Soviet labor camps, according to the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper.
The move comes after a court last August handed Navalny a further  a 19-year sentence on extremism charges, which Navalny and his allies say are politically motivated. It also ruled that he should be moved to a special prison for particularly dangerous prisoners, like ""Polar Wolf.""
Navalny has spent most of his detention at the IK-6 penal colony in the Vladimir region, some 250 kilometers east of Moscow.

https://www.dw.com/en/russia-alexei-navalny-located-in-siberia-prison-allies-say/a-67819985,POLITICS,"Russia: Alexei Navalny located in Siberia prison, allies say 25.12.2023","Alexei Navalny is ""doing well,"" his spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said on Monday, saying that the Russian opposition figure had been located in a penal colony in Russia's far north, in the Yamalo-Nenets region of western Siberia. 
The Kremlin critic has been missing for weeks, with many fearing for his life.
""We have found Alexey Navalny. He is now in IK-3 settlement of Kharp in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District,"" Yarmysh wrote on social media, using alternative spellings for Navalny and the region's names. 
""His lawyer visited him today,"" she said. 
Navalny's whereabouts had been unknown since early December, with friends and family unable to reach him, and court appointments in the various cases against him had been delayed without authorities providing reasons why. 
This had prompted concern among his supporters and international criticism.
""We have found Alexei!"" the manager of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation organization, Ivan Zhdanov, said. 
He said the IK-3 facility was nicknamed the ""Polar Wolf"" prison camp and that it was among the most remote in Russia. 
""The conditions there are brutal,"" he said. According to Zhdanov, there is permafrost at the camp, it's very difficult to reach and no letters are delivered there. 
Kharp is a remote town of around 6,500 people, according to a 2010 census, in the Ural mountains.
Zhdanov said the move should not come as a surprise. He has repeatedly accused the Kremlin of trying to isolate Navalny ahead of the presidential election on March 17, 2024.
President Vladimir Putin is expected to win another term. This would be his fifth as president with a period as prime minister between 2008 and 2012. Term limit rules have been abolished in Russia with relative ease since Putin first took power in 2000.
Navalny was previously being held in the IK-6 prison facility, a comparatively short distance southeast of Moscow.
The US State Department condemned Navalny's detention as ""unjust"" and expressed concern over the conditions in the prison.
""We remain deeply concerned for Mr. Navalny's wellbeing and the conditions of his unjust detention,"" a spokesperson said in a statement, while adding that the State Department welcomes reports that he had been located.
Washington condemned the ""malicious targeting"" of Navalny and called for his ""immediate release, without conditions.""
""We call on the Russian government to end its escalating repression of independent voices in Russia,"" the spokesperson said.
Navalny, 47, made a name for himself by publicly calling out corruption at the Kremlin, and first made a run to become Moscow's mayor in 2013. He is the founder of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, known in Russia as the FBK.
He faced repeated arrests, physical attacks, and various investigations and criminal proceedings, which he described as politically motivated, during his earlier years of political activity.

In 2020 he survived what German doctors said was a case of attempted poisoning using a Soviet-era nerve agent, Novichok. Comatose, he was flown to Germany for treatment. 
But Russian officials then warned that his convalescence in Germany violated the terms of his probation for a prior conviction. Navalny was arrested on his return early in 2021. 
He was first charged for violating the terms of his parole, but this was soon followed by charges of embezzlement and contempt of court, with a nine-year prison sentence. In August he was found guilty of a series of extremism-related charges and had his sentence extended to 19 years. That verdict also came with a court recommendation to relocate him to a more secure, harsher prison.

https://www.dw.com/en/do-indias-new-criminal-laws-give-police-too-much-power/a-67819287,LAW AND JUSTICE,Do India's new criminal laws give police too much power? 25.12.2023,"India's parliament passed three new bills last week to replace colonial-era criminal laws in what has been billed as the biggest overhaul of the country's criminal justice system since the country was under British rule.
The new laws — which were rushed through in the absence of over 40 opposition MPs who had been suspended for protesting an unrelated issue — replace the colonial-era Indian Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Evidence Act.
India's Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah, who introduced the bills to parliament, said they were aimed at removing archaic references to the Brtitish monarchy and other ""signs of our slavery."" 
The new laws include provisions to expand detention in police custody from the current 15-day limit to up to 90 days — bringing terror, corruption and organized crime under ordinary legislation and, for the first time, decriminalizing homosexuality and adultery.
The act of obtaining sex by promising marriage to a woman will be treated as a crime for the first time and will carry a 10-year sentence. Besides this, the new law also specifically defines the notion of consent.
It stipulates that forensic evidence must be used in offenses carrying a jail sentence of seven years or more for which more labs will be set up across the country.

Rights campaigners and critics say the new laws give authorities too much power.
Experts pointed out that the new legislation is neither anti-colonial nor transformative. Many say it is a missed opportunity to fix over-criminalization and hands enhanced power to the state and the police.
""The laws enacted by this government are 10 times more draconian,"" human rights lawyer Colin Gonsalves told DW.
""During the British period, you could keep a person in police custody for a maximum of 15 days. Now, extending 15 days to 90 days and more, is a shocking provision enabling police torture.""
Gonsalves also pointed out that dispensing with the provision of legal aid from the point of arrest was particularly problematic.
""Under the current law, legal aid is provided from arrest. In the new bill, there is no such provision. This is amazing,"" said Gonsalves.
Senior Supreme Court lawyer Shahrukh Alam, who has studied the criminal bills closely, pointed out that current bills reinforce power and disproportionately favour the law enforcement agencies and the prosecuting state.
""On reading the new codes one gets the sense that society and state are forever under attack from unknown quarters and the state must always act against its citizens as if we were in a state of emergency,"" Alam told DW.
""The opaqueness, the ambiguity, the arbitrariness, the rupture, the structural violence, the centralization of power, all of these are elements of colonialism and authoritarianism,"" she added.
Alam further said immense unilateral power has been given to the investigating agencies without any safeguards and several regressive provisions give more power to the police at the cost of citizens.

Political scientist and academic Pratap Bhanu Mehta was scathing in his attack, pointing out that in the name of decolonization, the laws just meant more arbitrary power to the state.
""The lack of outrage on the bills or indeed on virtually the entire opposition being suspended, may simply be a function of the fact that there is no appetite for constitutional reforms left. The bills attest to the inverted politics of our time,"" Mehta told DW.
Similarly, G. Mohan Gopal, a former director of the National Judicial Academy, said there is no real effort in the bills to enhance police accountability and that they were a recipe for enhancing repression.
""Like many other historic pieces of legislation, these three pivotal laws, that will deeply affect the lives of all Indians, have also been rushed through parliament with the explicit aim of avoiding any meaningful debate or genuine discussion on them,"" Gopal told DW.
The overhaul to India's criminal justice system is the latest effort by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in its campaign to remove lingering symbols of colonial rule from the country's politicial institutions.
The bills are expected to become law once President Draupadi Murmu gives assent, which is considered a formality.

""At the subsequent traffic checks it became clear that 'Santa Claus' was absolutely incapable of driving, at which point 'Santa's' ongoing journey was curtailed and a blood sample was taken,"" police said. 
Police said they confiscated his driving license and initiated investigations on suspicion of drunk driving. They did not note details like how badly the man failed the blood-alcohol test. 
""Nevertheless, 'Santa Claus' did announce that the gifts would be delivered the following day,"" police said, presumably on foot or with assistance from a little helper or two. By German traditions, that would make his delivery a day late, with people typically exchanging gifts on the evening of December 24.
""In that spirit: Merry Christmas, and remember, even 'Santa Claus' must drive sober,"" police concluded.

https://www.dw.com/en/the-future-of-interactive-artificial-intelligence/a-67797542,BUSINESS,Interactive AI to break onto the scene in 2024 25.12.2023,"Barely a year ago, few people had heard of Chat GPT, Bard and Llama — artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots that promised to make the world a lot more productive but would likely leave millions of people out of a job.
These AI assistants have since helped users around the world to generate content that would often take humans many more hours to achieve on their own. The huge layoffs threatened haven't happened, at least not yet. 
Dozens of alternatives have sprung up over the past year, with some specializing in app coding, video and graphic content production, or music creation.
Despite the incredible power of so-called large language models upon which these chatbots run, critics say they are plagiarizing the internet to produce content that is often bland, contains factual errors or shows political or racial bias.
Tesla founder Elon Musk has tried to address this with the beta launch of his AI assistant last month. Grok, as it's known, is billed as being a chatbot with ""a sense of humor"" and a ""rebellious streak,"" although it's also been accused of political bias.
As the AI space grows ever more competitive with tens of billions of dollars being invested globally, tech industry luminaries are predicting where the technology will head next.
One of them, Google DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, believes that the future of AI assistants will be in their ability to interact with humans in an advanced manner.
""The third wave will be the interactive phase,"" Suleyman told MIT Technology Review in September. ""That’s why I’ve bet for a long time that conversation is the future interface. You know, instead of just clicking on buttons and typing, you’re going to talk to your AI.""
Interactive AI will allow humans to have a deeper conversation with their AI chatbot. Whereas systems like Amazon's Alexa respond to simple commands, the next generation of AI tools will be able to respond in a more human-like way.
Suleyman said they will also be able to act on decisions by themselves, so users can give their assistant ""a general, high-level goal, and it will use all the tools it has to act on that.""
Interactive AI will talk to other people and other chatbots to achieve the goal set by the user.
The technology will also adapt to users' preferences and learn from user feedback, helping computers to function more like how humans work and think. 
Companies will be able to use Interactive AI to improve customer services, guiding users through troubleshooting steps.
The technology will also help with sales and marketing and lead generation by offering personalized communication based on a customer's individual needs.

Industry experts believe Interactive AI will produce content that is more novel and original.
Interactive AI will be able to shoulder the burden of more complex, time-consuming tasks that require interaction with other humans, websites and chatbots and can report back to the user regularly on progress or results.
By being able to handle more advanced feedback from users, interactive AI can also prevent harmful or offensive content from being produced or ensure complex projects are delivered exactly as specified.
Several firms are already pushing the interactive envelope. Suleyman's own chatbot, Pi AI, is a precursor to Interactive AI. Billed as ""your personal AI,"" it is designed to be used for brainstorming, planning and learning or even just venting.
Another early version of Interactive AI is Character.ai, which allows users to interact with multiple characters of AI assistants whose ""personalities"" have been crafted by other users. Many of the characters are fictional or based on celebrities. The platform says it exists to allow conversations and give advice.
While Suleyman thinks Interactive AI will make its presence felt in 2024, other industry pundits think true interactivity with chatbots is still several years away.

Microsoft founder Bill Gates believes that AI is about to ""supercharge the innovation pipeline"" as more people use the technology. 
In an end-of-year blog post, he said that high-income countries like the US would see significant levels of AI use by the general population within 18 to 24 months.
He predicted that African countries would begin to see a comparable level of AI use within three years or so.
""That’s still a gap, but it’s much shorter than the lag times we’ve seen with other innovations,"" Gates wrote.
Those predictions for AI do, however, feed into concerns that the technology could quickly replace millions of white-collar jobs that have been mostly spared by the computer revolution of the past 30 years.
While the impact on employment has, so far, been limited, some tech experts think it is only a matter of time before creative, finance, legal and medical jobs are replaced by AI.
Among the other negative predictions for AI in 2024, some tech analysts have warned about the proliferation of AI-generated deepfake videos and other disinformation ahead of the US presidential election in November.
Some experts have warned that the vote could be the first ""deepfake election"" because many voters won't be able to distinguish between what's real and what's not.

https://www.dw.com/en/2023-a-challenging-year-for-un-peacekeepers-in-africa/a-67558772,CONFLICTS,2023: A challenging year for UN peacekeepers in Africa 25.12.2023,"United Nations  peacekeeping missions have struggled in 2023 to protect civilians and bring stability to the countries they operate in, especially in Africa.
In countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), South Sudan, Mali and the Central African Republic (CAR), the UN troops have had little success.
According to some analysts, the UN missions that operate under strict guidelines have been overwhelmed in some of these countries.
""A clear case in point is Mali, [the security situation] has not been resolved because day by day the violence seems to be worsening,"" Adib Saani, director of the Jatikay Center for Human Security and Peace Building, told DW. ""It looks almost like the [UN] mission is helpless.""
For analysts like Saani, recent poor performances of UN missions in parts of Africa are disappointing.
""They have failed consistently to deal with the cycle of violence in those countries and the very reason for which they were brought in in the first place,"" Saani said.
UN missions have clear cut operational mandates that restrict their activities. For example, UN peacekeeping operations are not considered tools of enforcement.
They are not allowed to use lethal force except in self-defense or defense of their given mandate. Some experts blame the ""weak"" mandate for the peacekeeping struggles.
""I wouldn't say that the UN missions in Africa are all failing, but rather it is the nature of their mandate that limits their efficacy or effectiveness in the areas they are meant to operate,"" Fidel Amakye Owusu, an expert on conflict resolution, told DW.
He stressed that the limit to the operations of UN missions sometimes puts them in an awkward position where citizens consider them counterproductive to stabilizing volatile situations.

In Mali, citizens turned against the UN peacekeeping mission (MINUSMA) this year, and in June, the junta-led government demanded the mission's withdrawal, which was granted.
The mission was deployed a decade ago to quell separatist and Islamist insurgencies in northern Mali, but the military government accused the forces of escalating tensions.
In October, the UN said the mission is on track to leave the West African country by December 31 and ""is fully committed to respecting this time frame.""
The last German Bundeswehr soldiers deployed to Mali as part of the UN's MINUSMA peacekeeping mission there have already departed. They left Mali this month.
Germany deployed a total of 20,000 soldiers over the course of the peacekeeping mission — representing the second-largest foreign deployment of Bundeswehr troops behind the US-led invasion of Afghanistan.
Owusu said the governments, such as the one in Mali, are also to blame for jeopardizing the operation of missions.
""In the case of Mali, you would realize that in recent times, because of the coming in of Wagner, the UN mission in general was limited as to what it could do.""
The Wagner Group, a private military firm often described as a Russian mercenary force, is preferred by Mali's military rulers to help them deal with the jihadist threats there.
Conflict situations in Africa are very fluid and unpredictable, and according to Owusu, the nature of UN mandates makes it very difficult to react in volatile situations.
""So mostly, it appears as if they are not doing their best,"" Owusu said. ""However, it has to do with the limits of their mandate rather than how effective forces are involved or the mission itself.""
However, Owusu warned against making UN missions unwanted and demanding their exit as Mali and Congo did, saying it could become counterproductive.
In the case of Mali and the Sahel region, ""we still find an increased incidence of terrorism,"" Owusu said. Members of the extremist group, ""Islamic State,"" are still around and, he says, ""quite emboldened and capturing territories every day, every week.""
The UN missions are coming under pressure, and their relevance is being questioned, but according to Mohamed Amara at the University of Letters and Human Sciences in Bamako, their role is still critical.
He told DW he is worried, for example, that once missions fail and exit, governments may struggle to fill the void left behind by the withdrawal of the peacekeeping forces.
""It is important to emphasize that MINUSMA, somewhere, acts as a buffer between the Malian authorities and the rest of the territory. If MINUSMA leaves, it will therefore be necessary to replace all these security posts occupied by MINUSMA,"" Amara added.

But peacekeepers have also not done much to win the trust of their host countries. Some of them have been accused of sexual exploitation and abuse.
The UN sent home a unit of 60 Tanzanian peacekeepers over allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse in the Central African Republic this year.
Saani said that when such allegations of abuses aren't investigated and perpetrators not punished quickly, it complicates the work of the missions.
""For example, in the Darfur region there were some allegations of exploitation by peacekeepers, which I must say really dragged the peacekeeping mission in that area into disrepute,"" he said.
""So trust is, I must say, a problem. And there's another angle to it. Some feel that it is a ploy by Western powers to reassert, so to speak, their authority and control over the countries in which these peacekeepers operate.""
Another concern is the political instability in some countries where the missions operate. According to Saani, nothing new would be achieved if there was a lack of effective democratic systems.
""One of the reasons is political instability. You would only succeed when there is solid commitment politically. If there is no such commitment, it becomes very difficult for them,"" Saani said.
Owusu is urging reforms in the operations of the UN missions if they are to succeed in the coming years in Africa.
""Maybe UN missions going forward must be redefined, maybe to expand their mandate or to make them more fluid,"" Owusu said.
Saani agrees, stressing that the work of the UN missions is still relevant in Africa.
""I can't deny the fact that Africa cannot do it alone. We are not self reliant. However, what I think should happen is for the UN to restructure,"" Saani said.

https://www.dw.com/en/flood-warnings-issued-across-germany-ahead-of-christmas/a-67814507,NATURE AND ENVIRONMENT,Flood warnings issued across Germany ahead of Christmas 24.12.2023,"Recent heavy rainfall across Germany has increased the risk of flooding in several states, authorities said on Sunday.
The German weather service (DWD) issued warnings for Saxony in the east and Lower Saxony in the northwest, as well as Bavaria in the southeast and Hesse, North-Rhine Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate in the west.
It said that the persistent rain will continue until Christmas Day. The DWD added that 100-150 liters of rain per square meter could come down in a period of 48 to 96 hours in some areas.
Germany was also struck by major flooding in June.
The third-highest of four warning levels was reached at 30 measuring stations early on Sunday in Lower Saxony.
The threshold was exceeded in several rivers, including the Weser, Aller, Leine and Oker.
Emergency services secured transformer stations in the Rodenberg district east of Hanover, Germany's DPA news agency reported.
Rodenberg mayor Thomas Wolf said that water was flowing over an anti-flooding barrier and that the municipality had not seen comparable flooding in 25 years.
The eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt's flood forecasting center issued warnings for the Mulde, Aller and Havel rivers.
Alert 3 was reached in parts of the southeastern state of Saxony, including in the city of Chemnitz.
In the Ruhr Valley area, which includes the cities of Dortmund, Essen, Duisburg, and Bochum, heavy rain caused disruption on rail lines.
On Saturday, in a flooded suburb of Münster in North Rhine-Westphalia, firefighters rescued a woman who was trapped in her car.
This report was written in part with material from the German Press Agency (DPA).

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-boris-pistorius-rated-most-popular-politician/a-67814123,POLITICS,Germany: Boris Pistorius rated most popular politician 24.12.2023,"Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has been rated the most popular politician in Germany, according to a survey cited by the Bild am Sonntag newspaper on Sunday.
Pistorius belongs to the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), of which Chancellor Olaf Scholz is also a member. The party came to power late in 2021 and governs in coalition with the Greens and the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP).
42% of people surveyed by the political research group INSA said they wished for Pistorius to have more influence in German politics. This amounted to 55% of SPD voters, 58% of Greens voters, and 48% of FDP voters, but also 56% of supporters of the conservative opposition CDU/CSU coalition.
Pistorius' predecessor, Christine Lambrecht of the SPD, had an approval rating of 16% last year in an INSA survey. Pistorius replaced Lambrecht in January of this year.
Meanwhile, the chancellor's own rating saw a stark drop, with Scholz receiving a 26% approval rating, which was 10 points less than last year. He had the 12th highest approval rating this year, while in 2022 he was at third place in the INSA survey.
Multiple other members of Scholz's cabinet also lost between 5 and 7 points compared with their approval rating in 2022.

This year's survey indicates in increase in support for Germany's main opposition coalition, with the second most popular politician in 2022 being the head of the Bavarian CSU, Markus Söder. The leader of its Germany-wide sister party, Friedrich Merz of the CDU, had the third-highest approval rating.
Bild am Sonntag cited the head of INSA, Hermann Binkert, as saying that CDU/CSU is benefiting from a drop in approval of the governing coalition.
He added that this is also reflected in an increase in approval of the leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), Alice Weidel, as well as for populist politician Sahra Wagenknecht, who split from the socialist Left Party (Die Linke) to form her own group.

https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-government-fails-to-slash-growing-homelessness/a-67777139,SOCIETY,Germany's government fails to slash growing homelessness 24.12.2023,"The first homeless people start arriving at Berlin's Tabor church half an hour before it opens its doors. Once a week, the church hosts a cafe where homeless people can eat, drink and use the toilet. It soon hopes to offer hot meals, too.
It also lets people sleep inside the church once a week to escape the bitterly cold winter nights of the German capital. Mostly around 40 people bed down in the vestibule, although sometimes there are as many as 60. They also get food, and two volunteer doctors are also on hand to tend wounds or treat other ailments.
The people who come looking for a place to sleep are not the same as those who frequent the cafe, Tabor Church pastor Sabine Albrecht said.
""Those who fall through social safety nets can come here,"" she said. ""Some of them are in a very desolate state.""
Many people who are looking for somewhere to sleep come from Eastern Europe and are either unemployed or precariously employed. Many have addiction issues, have experiences of violence and suffer from mental illness.
One man, Albrecht said, ""has been sleeping here for 20 years."" Two of her ""guests,"" as she calls them, have passed away.
How does she deal with so much misery? ""A helper syndrome does no good. You need to be tough and not take things personally,"" Albrecht said.
This also means being able to deal with people who can be aggressive and rude, something that Margot Moser, who has helped organize the overnight stays since the church first offered the service 30 years ago, is capable of. The 79-year-old says that maybe she feels called to help because she has always had to make do with little money herself.
""Homelessness is a serious social problem,"" Werena Rosenke, managing director of the German Association for Homeless Assistance (BAG W), told DW. She sees a dramatic shortage in affordable housing as the main reason for homelessness.
BAG W is the national umbrella organization for emergency housing assistance services and facilities in Germany. According to its most recent data, 607,000 people were homeless in Germany in 2022. Of these, around 50,000 were living on the street.
The Federal Statistical Office only records homeless people registered in facilities and calculates that there Germany has 372,060 such residents.
The large difference in the two statistics has to do with how the numbers are compiled. BAG W's numbers are collected throughout the entire calendar year, rather than on certain days, and they also include data on so-called concealed homelessness, such as people who are staying with friends or family after losing their home.
""Prevention is the most important thing,"" Rosenke said. ""We have to prevent people from losing their homes in the first place. Many don't even know that they can apply for housing benefits or how to apply for a citizen's allowance."" It would be cheaper for local authorities if they took over rent debt instead of financing what are often overnight stays in hotels or other accommodation, she said.
Rosenke rattled off several relatively inexpensive measures for fighting homelessness. For example, facilitating the purchase of housing stock from private landlords and the housing industry. Or the refurbishment of emergency accommodation and their conversion into social housing.

When Germany's coalition government came to power, it set the goal of building 400,000 new homes a year, 100,000 of which were to be for welfare or social housing. ""Social housing"" means a landlord receives state subsidies in return for renting apartments at fixed prices well below the usual market rate to tenants with social housing eligibility certificates.
The government is miles away from meeting its targets. For Werena Rosenke, they were too modest anyway: ""100,000 social housing units per year — as promised by the federal government — would not even be enough to counter the lack of affordable housing.""
In addition to social housing, Rosenke said, 100,000 affordable homes are needed. ""Only around 25,000 affordable new housing units have been built in recent years,"" complains the BAG W boss. ""They can't even compensate for the reduction of social housing stock that comes with the expiration of commitments,"" she says.
Rosenke is calling for fixed quotas for homeless people in social housing, as they are often not even considered potential tenants because of prejudices.
Germany's government has declared its intent to end homelessness in the country by 2030 with the help of an action plan to be adopted by the Cabinet in early 2024. However, it could be years before it is implemented by the 16 German states, cities and municipalities.
Back at the Tabor parish, 10 people gathered in the vestibule. One man is curled up in front of the heater. Pastor Sabine Albrecht smiles and says: ""A lot of them do that to get warm again.""
Two other men read books — bread and coffee from parishioners on the table in front of them. They looked like well-kept elderly students.
""More and more,"" Albrecht said, ""I see people showing up to our ... cafe that I would never imagine are in need or homeless.""

""This year, the world has indeed presented its dark side,"" Steinmeier said, according to the text of his speech released by his office ahead of the broadcast on Christmas Day. 
""The Russian war of aggression against Ukraine is now entering its second winter,"" Steinmeier said. ""And, since the autumn, we have been looking in horror at Hamas' atrocities and at what is happening to the victims of the war in the Middle East.""
Despite the challenges, Steinmeier stressed the importance of hope and the need to approach the new year with courage and determination. 
""We all long for a more peaceful world,"" he said, reiterating his belief that ""we must never abandon"" this.

The German president emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong democracy, stating that that could only happen if people were engaged and if they worked to ""ensure that what is not yet good today is better tomorrow.""
Steinmeier acknowledged that the year has left many Germans concerned about ""unresolved issues here in our country"" without directly mentioning them.
Some Germans have expressed skepticism toward the government's ability to address these challenges, while others have expressed worries about the long-term implications of these issues.
""We will only ever make progress if we work together — and not if everyone shrinks back into their worlds,"" Steinmeier said. 
The speech included gratitude for police, firefighters, military personnel, health care workers and other institutions.
""There are millions of people like you, determined and dedicated in helping others, working for peaceful coexistence in a diverse society,"" Steinmeier said. ""And it is these people who give me courage.""
Looking forward to next year, Steinmeier noted that Germany's Basic Law is turning 75 and should be celebrated. 
""Our constitution is something of which we can be proud,"" Steinmeier said. ""It protects and values every individual.""
Steinmeier said the constitution could guide the nation through challenging times.
""Let us take the time every so often to remember that Germany is and remains a good country,"" Steinmeier said.
""We can and will succeed if we make an effort, if we stand together and stay together,"" the president said.

https://www.dw.com/en/berlins-christmas-service-for-homeless-at-central-station/a-67777024,SOCIETY,Berlin's Christmas service for homeless at central station 23.12.2023,"The Berlin City Mission will hold a Christmas service in the center of the main hall at the capital's central station on Sunday. During the Christmas Eve service, which is being held for the 18th time since the opening of the main station in 2006, church bells ring through the loudspeaker system. The congregation sits on simple wooden benches; many people hold plastic bags that contain all their belongings as they sing Christmas carols from a hymn sheet.
Pastor Christian Ceconi, the director of the Berlin City Mission, will give the sermon on Sunday (Christmas is celebrated on December 24 in Germany). Run by the Protestant Church, the nonprofit association is the German capital's best-known provider of projects for homeless people.
Ceconi drew a parallel between the birthplace of Jesus about 2,000 years ago and today. ""There were no houses available in Bethlehem,"" Ceconi said. ""There was no place to stay. The shepherds on the outskirts of town were forced to move away.""
Ceconi said Mary and Joseph and the shepherds may have seen themselves as insignificant and of no importance to anyone, but suddenly they found themselves ""at the center of world history.""
""A train station is always a place of transition, where people come together who would otherwise never meet,"" Ceconi said. ""And, in the middle of it all, they meet God, just like the shepherds back then in Bethlehem.""
Ceconi said he saw ""a variety of totally different people"" when he looked at the congregation at the main station in 2022. ""There were a lot of homeless people sitting there that I might also meet when I get off the S-Bahn in the morning,"" he said. Other people there included travelers and workers for the national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn. ""From homeless people to railroad managers, I was also touched by this mixture,"" Ceconi said.












Unlike airports, large train stations in Germany do not generally have religious spaces or chapels. And yet the setting in Berlin almost looks as if it was made for a Christmas Eve celebration: The wooden benches stand next to a huge fir tree covered in thousands of LED lights. A wreath hangs in front of the huge glass facade, and the escalators behind the simple altar at the center of the celebration stand still for the duration of the service. As congregants sang on Christmas Eve 2022, two floors up trains from western cities such as Cologne and Amsterdam rolled onto platform 11.
Berlin's central station is ""a place of everyday life, of welcome and farewell, of frustration and joy,"" Monika Jung, the manager of Berlin's long-distance train stations, told DW. At Christmastime, the building shines in a festive light. ""The magic of this special place is completely fulfilled when songs and words of peace fill the room,"" Jung said. Travelers and employees can ""enjoy the moment and forget that life in the station really never stands still.""

When the service is over, volunteers from Berlin City Mission stack the wooden benches, clear away the barriers, offer hot tea and look after guests who may not yet have a place to stay for the night. ""For me, all those sitting there are the shepherds,"" Ceconi said. ""After all, of all those present at the birth of Jesus Christ, the shepherds were probably the ones who least expected to make an appearance in such a story. But, at the manger, they belonged. And they could feel: God is coming to me.""
People who are homeless often live in the shadows of society, Ceconi said, ""and if God wants to bring light into the darkness at Christmas, then he first comes to the people in the shadows of society.""

His wife, Loki, is also buried at the same grave at a cemetery in the northern city-state of Hamburg.
Police said painted swastikas were found on the grave on Friday night and immediately removed.
The Helmut and Loki Schmidt Foundation condemned the act as ""mindless vandalism.""
""This mindless vandalism is a massive attempt to damage the memory of both [Helmut and Loki Schmidt],"" it said in a statement. ""Both Loki and Helmut were always committed to freedom, democracy and mutual understanding between the world's peoples.""
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser called the vandalism an ""abominable"" and ""historically oblivious"" act.
""Helmut and Loki Schmidt always stood against contempt for humanity, racism and antisemitism,"" she said, adding that the pair maintained ""awareness of [German] history.""
Schmidt, who was a member of the Social Democrats (SPD), led West Germany from 1974 to 1982. West and East Germany were reunited in 1990 and became the Federal Republic of Germany, as it is officially known today. 
Germany's current chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is also a member of the SPD.
The former chancellor died in November 2015. From 1983 until his death, he was a co-editor of the weekly newspaper Die Zeit.
The vandalism incident on Friday occurred a day before Schmidt's birthday.

https://www.dw.com/en/russia-ex-reporter-barred-from-challenging-putin-in-2024/a-67809903,POLITICS,Russia: Ex-reporter barred from challenging Putin in 2024 23.12.2023,"Former TV journalist Yekaterina Duntsova has been barred from running in March's presidential election because of ""mistakes"" in her application for registration as a candidate, Russian television reported.
A video posted by a Russian news channel showed a meeting of the Central Elections Committee (CEC) where the members voted unanimously to reject Duntsova's candidacy.
Duntsova's campaign team also confirmed the rejection on its Telegram channel and showed screenshots of documents the CEC had highlighted as lacking the proper signatures.

Duntsova said she would appeal the decision in Russia's Supreme Court, describing it as ""unlawful.""
She appealed to leaders of the Yabloko (Apple) political party to nominate her as a candidate, as she said she would be unable to convene a second meeting of supporters. 
Duntsova, 40, would have been a challenger to President Vladimir Putin, and was planning to run on a platform of ending the war in Ukraine and freeing political prisoners.
With most Russian opposition figures either behind bars, like high-profile rival Alexei Navalny, or outside the country, Putin seems almost certain to win a fifth term as head of state in March, cementing a decadeslong grip on power.
The CEC has said it will also hold the ballot in four Ukrainian regions partially occupied by Russian forces and in the Crimean peninsula, illegally annexed from Kyiv in 2014.
Had Duntsova's application been accepted, under Russian election law she would still have to have obtained 300,000 signatures in support of her candidacy, from all across Russia by January 31.

https://www.dw.com/en/has-germanys-state-education-system-failed/a-67781684,SOCIETY,Has Germany's state education system failed? 23.12.2023,"""I choose the school [not for religious reasons] but because it has a strong community,"" said Luisa* of her decision to send her two children to a private Catholic school in Berlin. ""It's a really kind environment, very personal, love it.""
Luisa said that her children simply couldn't get the support they needed at the state schools in the German capital where teachers often called in sick and hardly any of the children could speak German. ""It was a race to the bottom so to say. There were so many kids that needed special focus that the teacher focused on that ... and there was no individual care for kids who have more talents,"" she explained.
Luisa pays monthly fees of between €180 and €360 ($197-$394) (the fees are staggered by parental income) to send her children to the Catholic school.
In Germany, private schools can be run by churches, social welfare organizations, associations or private individuals.
While state-run schools and even universities are free in Germany, a growing number of parents are opting to pay an average annual fee of €2,030 to send their child to private school. The latest figures released by the German Statistical Office show that the proportion of pupils attending private schools has increased to almost 10% in the 2022/23 school year. Two decades ago, it was 6%.
The rising number of children enrolled at private schools has led to concerns that wealthy, well-educated parents are turning their backs on the state school system and, in turn, fueling social inequality.

Comparative social policy expert Stephan Köppe from University College Dublin says there is no evidence that in Germany, children at private schools perform any better than at state schools.
""What is concerning is that it really points towards either discontent with the state school system or so far unexplained cultural changes,"" Köppe told DW.
Indeed, a recent survey by the Munich Info Institute for Economic Research indicates that Germans are increasingly unhappy about the quality of education in their country. 
In world's fourth largest economy, schools lie in a state of disrepair, with buildings quite literally crumbling and often closed for repair work. Schools have been slow to digitalize, with many unable to afford computers and lacking reliable or fast Wi-Fi.
Germany's schools also face a desperate shortage of teachers, with high sick rates and an increasing number leaving the profession due to exhaustion and poor working conditions. The baby-boomer generation of teachers is also heading into retirement. 
The latest Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) report commissioned by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) was bad news too: ninth graders in Germany performed worse than ever in maths, science and reading, leading to much handwringing about what has gone wrong with the education system in the land of poets and thinkers.
Some blame the sorry state of the German education system on immigration. Roughly 217,000 Ukrainian child refugees now attend school in Germany.
And the overall the number of students is growing: the German Statistical Office reported that 830,000 children started school in 2023, the highest number in 20 years.
But immigration isn't the problem, says education and social inequality expert Marcel Helbig from Germany's Leibniz Institute for Educational Trajectories.
""The performance at [Gymnasien, or university preparation secondary schools] where there are hardly any migrant kids has also fallen very sharply. It is more than just a migrant-specific problem that we are dealing with here,"" he told DW. 
According to Helbig, all the evidence suggests academic achievement in Germany remains steadfastly tied to socio-economic background and not the school a child goes to.
So why are more parents opting to send their kids to private schools?
""Many parents, mostly those from the middle and upper classes, above all academics, are attracted to the [educational] model at private schools, but it's really hard to tell whether it's really the pedagogy at a particular school that they find so great … or that they don't want their kids going to a state school because, for example, there are large numbers of migrant kids, poor kids,"" said Helbig.
In Germany, the vast majority of children go to schools within their local catchment area. The socio-economic divide is most apparent in urban centers where parents have a choice of different schools and can effectively buy or maneuver their way out of the state school system, said Stephan Köppe.
He gave the example of university educated parents living in Neukölln, one of Berlin's most rapidly gentrifying and poorest districts, who would probably not choose for their child to go to a local school. ""Research also revealed that some parents in Berlin had given fake home addresses in order to get their kids into a better school in another catchment area,"" he said.
But what is good for one child is not good for society as a whole, as children from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds become effectively segregated in state schools in poorer urban districts. ""All PISA studies have shown that the longer you keep the kids together, it has little effect on the top performers, but it all lifts the lower performers,"" said Köppe.

Private school fees in Germany are relatively low in comparison to countries such as the US ($16,050) and the UK ($17,700). That's because the majority of private schools in Germany receive the bulk of their funding from the local state government. 
The German constitution or ""Basic Law"" (""Grundgesetz"") also states that private schools are not allowed to discriminate between which children can attend based on parents' income. To get around this, many private schools offer scholarships. Still, the number of scholarships is limited, and going private just isn’t an option for many parents in a country where the average before-tax salary is below €4,000 a month.
The right to establish a private school is guaranteed under the German constitution where the intention was to protect religious plurality on account of German history.
""From a democratic point of view, I wouldn't say that private schools should be banned or abolished, but the question is: should they be encouraged?"" said Köppe.
The real problem, Köppe said, is not private schools but the structure of the school system itself. Under Germany's so-called ""track system"", in some states the decision is made as early as in Year 4, when pupils are aged around 10, about whether they can attend a Gymnasium — an academic high school equivalent to a grammar school in the UK or a lycée in France. Germany's gymnasiums are the standard path to a university education.
Germany is still a long way off the type of inequality of outcomes seen between private and public schools in the US and the UK, Köppe said. ""There's a slight upward trajectory, so over time private schools might cause more inequalities in outcomes. So far, the major problem in Germany remains the track system,"" said Köppe.

https://www.dw.com/en/do-chinese-firms-employ-convicts-from-china-in-africa/a-67802241,MIGRATION,Do Chinese firms employ convicts from China in Africa? 22.12.2023,"Nigeria has recently seen the resurgence of a years-old rumor: The story goes that some Chinese companies are importing prisoners from China to work in Nigeria.
The rumor has been making the rounds among Nigerians, fed by a number of Nigerian officials, including Adams Oshiomhole, chairman of the Senate Committee on Interior.
""I have on good authority that prisoners from foreign land are working in Nigeria as construction workers,"" Oshiomhole said earlier this month. ""I even believe and dare say it that there are foreign prisoners who are working in Nigeria. They were shipped to our country to serve their prison terms.""
Caroline Wura-Ola Adepoju, the newly inaugurated comptroller general of immigration, commented on the allegations last week, without agreeing or denying that prisoners had indeed been brought to Nigeria.
""Saying that Chinese prisoners are brought in and employed in their companies in Nigeria is very subjective,"" Adepoju said. ""It is contrary to the international convention to name a particular race. However, before anybody comes into the country, they are subjected to thorough checks before issuing visa applications.""
Such practice would not be tolerated, Adepoju said, stressing that ""there is a new sheriff in town.""
However often the practice of bringing prisoners to Nigeria is reiterated, proof is hard to come by. Nigerian economist and public policy expert Zuhumnan Dapel spoke with DW about the difficulties of providing facts.
""Immigration, they are law enforcement. They bear firearms to enforce the law,"" Dapel told DW. ""[Caroline Wura-Ola Adepoju is] part of Nigeria's national security team. So she will have more information than the common man on the street — but I cannot verify this as an individual.""
Provided this was actually taking place, legal experts leave no doubt that there is no basis for such a practice.
""The Nigerian labor law, the international labor law and its conventions and the Nigerian Immigration Act — there is nowhere the laws contemplate a foreign prisoner to be given a work permit and to be accorded the status of a worker of a foreign company in Nigeria,"" Zakari Sokga, a Kaduna-based lawyer, told DW.
""There is also no bilateral arrangement between any foreign country and Nigeria to legitimize prisoners serving prison terms in their own country for whatever crime to come into Nigeria as employees of a foreign company. Such a practice is illegal and it cannot be defended in law"".
Zuhumnan Dapel said such instances required action by the comptroller general of immigration. ""If Chinese prisoners find their way to Nigeria through the back door, they don't have rights or work permits to work. That's illegitimate, and as the chief immigration officer in the country, it is her [Caroline Wura-Ola Adepoju] job to clamp down on illegal immigrants coming to work in the country.""
Social scientist and China expert Barry Sautman has been looking into rumors of Chinese prisoners working in various African countries for more than a decade. They are persistent in Nigeria and Zambia, but also circulate in countries like Tanzania or Angola, Sautman told DW. During his enquiries, however, he has not been able to produce any hard facts to prove such a practice.
""Not a single person has ever confirmed any aspect of it,"" said Sautman. The Hong Kong-based academic, who is renowned for his thorough research, has also been subject to criticism for holding views close to the line of the Chinese administration.
Chinese businessmen found talk of prisoners sent to Africa to be unimaginable, according to Sautman. ""Of course they have all kinds of problems in terms of bringing their personnel to Africa. And those problems are bad enough with bringing people who are free laborers. To bring somebody who is a convict and have to manage and secure that person — to them is just comical.""
One cause of the rumor, Sautman suggested, is the kind of gated and secured compounds found across Africa where Chinese workers live. ""Some Africans who I speak to about it have seen these kind of compounds and they think 'this looks like a prison to us'. They also know that in some cases companies will bring their workers out as a group to go shopping, they have entertainment… and then they come back.""
To understand the dynamics behind the narrative of Chinese prisoners working in African countries, the timing can be key. ""These allegations most of the time rear their heads during election cycles,"" said economist Zuhumnan Dapel. ""Nigeria was due to elect its next president in 2019, that was when these allegations came up.""
At the time there were protests by unemployed Nigerian graduates, Dapel explained. ""These protests were obviously that 'you're taking over the jobs we should be doing.'""
Four years later, the argument still circulates. ""It's more-or-less like you're making people who can carry out the job effectively, you're making them redundant,"" one woman in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, told DW. ""Why do you get people who are in prison to come and serve in another country? I think it's unfair.""
This holds for other African countries as well, said Sautman. ""In those African countries where the opposition has made China an issue, the idea that there are Chinese prisoners taking jobs away from local people, that's something that might be useful in their political discourse,"" he added.
He mentioned from his research in Zambia that several opposition figures who opposed Chinese dominance on the continent loosened their stance once they were in government.
One major reason for the outcry, it seems, is the strong presence of Chinese companies across Africa, companies that are known to contract workers from China. According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University in the US state of Maryland, the number of Chinese (contracted or hired) workers peaked at 12,199 in 2019 — the year the allegations of Chinese companies bringing convicts to Nigeria first made the rounds.
This, together with a perceived lack of transparency in Sino-Africa cooperation, may have laid the ground for the debate to spring up.

""What leaders owe to their people is to be telling the truth, to be transparent,"" said Dapel. ""When there are gray areas people try to understand the unknown, and in an attempt to understand the unknown, they come up with conspiracy theories. And to give no room for conspiracy theories is to come out clean.""
Dapel also pointed to the fact, irritating for many, that Chinese companies have a record of outbidding local and international competitors — although, as he explained, China's minimum wage is roughly seven times higher than that of Nigeria.
Sautman, the Hong Kong-based expert, however, has a reason for that. ""A lot of Chinese companies don't have the same conception of profits,"" he pointed out. Whereas Western companies often expected projects to produce at least 30% profit, things are different for Chinese bidders, he said.
""Five to 10% profit is just fine because in the Chinese market, the range of profit is anywhere between 1 and 4%.""

https://www.dw.com/en/sudan-despite-violence-pro-democracy-groups-wont-give-up/a-67799806,POLITICS,"Sudan: Despite violence, pro-democracy groups won't give up 22.12.2023","This week,  the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in Sudan achieved a major strategic victory against the Sudanese Armed Forces. After days of fighting, the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, gained control over Sudan's second-largest city Wad Medani, around 180 kilometers (110 miles) south of the capital, Khartoum.
The two military groups have been fighting since April. The Sudanese Armed Forces has about 200,000 personnel and is headed by General Abdel-Fattah Burhan; it works more like a regular army. Meanwhile the RSF is estimated to have 70,000 to 100,000 personnel and is headed by Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti.
The RSF works more like a guerrilla force, and now seems to have the upper hand. ""Capturing Wad Medani is definitely an indication for a turning point in favor of the Rapid Support Forces,"" Hamid Khalafallah, a Sudanese policy analyst, told DW. 
After this week, the armed forces effectively only have control over the east and north of the country. Darfur and the south are under RSF control, or remain a combat zone. There have been reports that both sides are committing war crimes. Residents of RSF-controlled areas have reported mass rapes, looting, killings and detentions, something the RSF has denied.
Observers in Wad Medani have reported that some 300,000 people have fled the city. Most are heading south toward the city of Sennar, around 100 kilometres (62 miles) away. But eyewitnesses have said RSF fighters don't allow everyone to leave.
""RSF fighters loot private cars and belongings so that civilians, including women with babies, are in a state of panic and leave by foot,"" said Khalafallah. His father is one of the many civilians fleeing Wad Medani.
 
Since the outbreak of the fighting in April, more than half a million Sudanese civilians have taken refuge in Jazeera province and Wad Medani, its capital. It was widely considered safe because the Armed Forces were in charge there, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Many international aid organizations had been coordinating humanitarian support from the city, but suspended efforts this week after the RSF takeover.
Michelle D'Arcy, Sudan country director for the Norwegian People's Aid organization, doesn't believe that Sennar, or any other city, can offer safety for civilians. ""There are no safe zones really,"" she told DW. ""People are moving but they're also moving to zones that could be affected by conflict very soon.""
Things are not looking good, but somehow Sudanese civil society activists have not given up. They played a major role during the democratic transition period after the country's popular uprising ousted long-term dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019.
Following Bashir's ouster — a combined effort from civilian pro-democracy protesters and the Sudanese military — the army agreed to share power with civilians until real elections could be held.
But the transition toward democracy ended in late 2021 when the Sudanese military took control in a coup. Since then, the two military forces have been jousting for power. When that power struggle turned into ongoing violence earlier this year, Sudanese civil society was effectively excluded from national politics.
Around 5.5 million people have since been displaced inside Sudan, and at least another 1.3 million people have sought refuge in neighboring countries, including in Egypt, Libya, Chad, the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Ethiopia, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency.
That includes many of the original pro-democracy activists.
""Life in the host country is difficult,"" Rania Abdelaziz, a Sudanese activist who fled to Egypt this summer, told DW. ""Those who came with savings have spent it by now. Those who came with jobs have lost them [due to the collapse of the economy in Sudan], and employment [in Egypt] is not allowed, so even applying for a job is not an option,"" she said. 
Any hope Abdelaziz has for the future of her country is in Sudanese civil society in Sudan and abroad, she said.
""The neighborhood committees have turned into emergency response teams in war-affected areas,"" she said. ""Others contribute to the political narrative in the hope of a solution to the war."" She is referring to the so-called ""neighborhood resistance committees"" that were formed by civilians in Sudanese neighboods during pro-democracy protests. 
Activists are also continuing to work away from home. 
""We founded the Sudanese Youth Network in Uganda's capital Kampala in October,"" Abdel Basit, a lawyer and activist, told DW. Since then, around 200 young Sudanese activists have joined from Chad, Nairobi, Ethiopia and Sudan. On Facebook, they come together to discuss topics like how to end the war, make peace and establish a democratic government under civilian rule.
""Most Sudanese are young and well connected,"" Basit told DW. ""All of them are frustrated about what is happening now and they believe that their only chance is to come up with an idea of how to build our new Sudan.""
There isn't much hope that violence will subside soon. The two forces are evenly matched, and experts fear the Sudanese conflict is devolving into a proxy war. Saudi Arabia and Egypt back the Sudan Armed Forces, while the United Arab Emirates supports the RSF.
""A proxy war is being fought in Sudan, a fact that has received little attention to date,"" Roman Deckert, a Sudan researcher at the Berlin-based organization Media in Cooperation and Transition, told German news agency EPD. As long as these countries continue to support the opposing Sudanese generals, he said it's unlikely fighting will end.
So far, at least 12,000 people have died in the war, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, which collects real-time data on political violence and protest activity around the world.

https://www.dw.com/en/is-kim-jong-un-grooming-his-daughter-to-rule-north-korea/a-67799236,POLITICS,Is Kim Jong Un grooming his daughter to rule North Korea? 22.12.2023,"Kim Ju Ae first appeared in public alongside her father, the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, at the launch of a missile in November 2022. Believed to be about 9 years old at the time, she caught the attention of the analysts and media, but there was little debate about her future role in a regime that is steadfastly male-dominated. 
By February 2023, Kim Ju Ae had accompanied her father to five events, and still the consensus was that she could not be considered the heir in the isolated and impoverished nation.
North Korea's Confucian value system prevents a woman from ruling. Under this practice, the military would not take orders from a woman.
That accepted wisdom has been evolving in recent months, however, and took a more decisive turn on December 6 when South Korean Unification Minister Kim Yung-ho said at a media event that the North Korean leader appears to be ""in a hurry"" to put his daughter in the spotlight, despite her tender age, and prepare the nation for a third transfer of power within the world's only hereditary communist dynasty.  
The minister's conclusions are now shared by the South's National Intelligence Service, with director Cho Tae-yong telling broadcaster KBS earlier this month that he believes Kim Ju Ae is indeed being groomed to one day take over from her father.
Cho said the North Korean propaganda machine has swung into top gear and is busily building a cult of personality around the girl, with domestic media now referring to her as the ""Morning Star of Korea,"" a title that was previously reserved for Kim Il Sung, the nation's founder and her great-grandfather. 
Even those who had reservations a year ago are coming around to the idea that Kim Jong Un is laying the groundwork to eventually hand over the baton to his daughter. 

""Previously, I was skeptical that the North could have a female leader, but gradually that has changed as Kim Ju Ae has appeared at more and more military events — which is extremely meaningful,"" said Kim Sung Kyung, an expert on North Korean society and culture at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.
""Wherever Kim Jong Un goes and whatever he says is very carefully calculated for both the rest of the world and a domestic audience,"" she told DW. ""At first, analysts assumed there was a political intent behind Kim's daughter appearing with him, but few considered it possible that this patriarchal socialist society would have a female leader.""
One alternative theory that was put forward, she said, was that having a young girl accompanying the dictator would somehow soften his image, even when she was largely attending military events, such as missile launches or military parades.  
A growing alternative school of thought is that Kim is laying the groundwork for an eventual transition of power. These actions already have parallels to historic precedent in the Kim family, the professor added.
Kim Il Sung handed over military power to his son, Kim Jong Il. The second hereditary ruler of North Korea then committed the nation to developing nuclear weapons, which Kim Jong Un inherited when his father died in December 2011.

In turn, Kim Jong Un has invested heavily in developing a nuclear arsenal and an array of ballistic missiles, the most capable of which are believed to be able to strike the US mainland. And this is the military power that he is visibly handing on to his daughter in an effort to legitimize her rule when the time comes. 
""Many analysts have pointed to Kim Ju Ae's gender as ruling her out of leading the North, but I do not believe it is such an important issue,"" said Kim Sung Kyung. State media has time to create the image of Kim Ju Ae as both the powerful leader, associated with men, as well as a caring mother figure for the nation, she added.  
""I believe now that it is possible that North Korea's next leader will be female, but Kim Ju Ae's young age makes it just too early to say for certain,"" she said.  
Lim Eul-chul, a professor of North Korean economy and politics at The Institute of Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University in Seoul, echoed that caution.
""When it comes to her future role, we need to keep all possibilities open and take a cautious approach,"" he said. ""Kim Ju Ae is only 10 years old. And while she is frequently seen with her father at military-related events, there is still little evidence to determine what specific roles she holds or will play in the future.""
""Whether or not Kim Ju Ae remains a real potential successor will likely depend on the abilities and qualities she demonstrates in the future and the strategic judgement of her father.""

Lim said it's likely that Kim Jong Un is at the very least using his daughter ""to project the image of a responsible leader"" and solidify his control of the nation.  
""There is also the aspect of showing off the fourth generation"" of Kim family leaders of the nation to underline the strength and legitimacy of the lineage, he added. 
There has been speculation in the past that Kim Jong Un has experienced medical complaints and appears overweight in news footage. His own father, Kim Jong Il, also reportedly suffered from a number of lifestyle-related illnesses, including high blood pressure, gout and diabetes, and died at the age of 70.  
Now 39, Kim Jong Un may be hoping that by marking a clear line of succession while he is still young, this will help Kim Ju Ae to smoothly assume the leadership of North Korea when the time comes. But analysts point out that there are plenty of other scenarios that are equally plausible.

https://www.dw.com/en/bethlehem-gaza-war-mars-christmas-festivities/a-67789339,RELIGION,Bethlehem: Gaza war mars Christmas festivities 22.12.2023,"The anticipation of Christmas has always been the best thing, Nuha Tarazi said, placing a bowl of Christmas cookies on the kitchen table. But this year is very different: There are no Christmas decorations in her home.
""We always looked forward to the holidays every year,"" Tarazi, a retired English teacher, told DW. She has not received a permit from the Israeli authorities to visit her relatives in her hometown in Gaza City for six years.
""Who wants to think about Christmas celebrations now with what is happening in Gaza?"" Tarazi said.
At Christmas, her relatives from Gaza City were usually allowed to visit her in the occupied West Bank. Tarazi was born in Gaza, but has lived in Beit Sahour, a town neighboring Bethlehem, for many decades. Many people here have relatives and friends in the Gaza Strip, where there is still a small Christian community.
For festivals such as Christmas or Easter, Israeli authorities usually issued the coveted exit permits to Palestinian Christians in the sealed-off Gaza Strip, which has been ruled for the past 17 years by the militant Hamas group.
However, it was always uncertain whether such a permit would be granted, and often not all members of a family were allowed to leave. In some years, the number of exit permits was severely limited depending on the political situation. But at least there was hope of seeing each other over the festive period and spending time together.
Now, though, everything is different again. Israel's Erez border crossing has been closed since the Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7 in southern Israel and the subsequent war. This means the route to the occupied West Bank and to Jerusalem is also closed.
But Tarazi is also in mourning: Her sister was killed in an Israeli attack on a building on the grounds of the Greek Orthodox Porphyrius Church in Gaza City in October. According to a statement from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, 18 people died in the attack, many of whom had sought shelter on the premises.
""I am alone here, and I don't know how to deal with it. My thoughts only revolve around what's happening there in Gaza,"" said Tarazi, struggling to keep her composure. She added that she wasn't even able to attend her sister's funeral.
The constant worry about other siblings and relatives keeps her busy day and night, as communication is difficult as well. ""The only thing that helps is to go into my garden and see my flowers, and take care of it,"" she said.
Tarazi isn't the only one who doesn't feel like celebrating Christmas this year. In Bethlehem, the supposed birthplace of Jesus, there will be no Christmas festivities.
Manger Square in front of the Church of the Nativity, usually packed with thousands of local and foreign visitors during the Christmas season, is empty. The city hasn't put up the large Christmas tree or the Nativity scene, and Christmas decorations and lights are nowhere to be found.
""There is no atmosphere of the feast, there are no festivities because of what is happening in Palestine, in Gaza,"" said Basel, who sells grilled chicken on Star Street, a historic street leading to Manger Square.

""Normally there would be lots of people from all over the world, from different religions, but there is no Christmas atmosphere at all,"" said Yara Alama, who lives in Bethlehem. ""You get the feeling that you can't feel any joy because of the war and what's happening to the people in Gaza.""
The Church of the Nativity, built over the site where Jesus is believed to have been born, is also unusually empty and silent. There are no long queues of people waiting to visit the narrow grotto below, where a silver star marks the sacred spot.
Father Issa Taljieh, who was born in Bethlehem, has been the church's parish priest for the Greek Orthodox community for the past 12 years. In all his time there, he said, he has never experienced such a sad Christmas season.
""People are grieving and sad about what is happening in Gaza,"" he said. ""This is the first time that the Nativity Church, the place where Jesus was born, I see it empty like this. Even during COVID-19 there were still local people that came and celebrated Christmas with us.""
During the pandemic, foreign visitors were not able to come to Bethlehem, and the tourism industry that the city depends on suffered as a result. Since October 7, access to the city, which is already cut off from Jerusalem by the Israeli separation barrier, has become even more difficult. The Israeli army has set up barriers on many access roads, which people have to cross on foot, and cars are only allowed to drive during certain hours.
In Gaza, as of December 21, more than 20,000 Palestinians had been killed, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.
According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), at least 491 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, making 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank since OCHA began recording casualties in 2005. In Israel, over 1,100 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed on October 7. Over 120 hostages are still believed to be held captive in Gaza.
Taljieh, whose first name means ""Jesus"" in Arabic, is trying to help his congregation through these difficult times.
""We can't celebrate in Bethlehem while people are killed there in Gaza, while their homes are destroyed, they become homeless, without food, without a safe place and in the middle of winter. We must include them in our prayers and pray for peace and security,"" he said.
While festivities in the city are canceled, the Christmas liturgies at the Church of the Nativity will still go ahead. On December 24, the Latin Patriarch from Jerusalem will make his entrance to Bethlehem, but this year without the accompanying music of the Palestinian scout groups. The traditional midnight Mass will also take place. About two weeks later, the Orthodox communities will celebrate their Christmas festivities, according to their calendars.
With the ongoing suffering and the hopeless situation in the Gaza Strip, it's important to draw strength from faith, said Father Rami Askarieh, parish priest of the Latin parish of St. Catherine Church in Bethlehem.
""We need Christmas now. Yes, it will be a celebration without music, without the scouts, without festivities,"" he said. ""But it is important that we keep the religious rituals, that there is a message of peace from this city to the world, a message of peace that emanates from Jesus' birthplace.""

The pro-democracy advocate's trial has gained international attention.
Lai is in the dock for ""collusion"" with foreign forces and has been charged under the Beijing imposed national security law. If found guilty, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
He has also been accused of ""conspiracy to produce seditious publications.""
His legal team argued for the nullification of the sedition charge as the prosecution acted late — after the six-month deadline mandated by Hong Kong law.
However, the court rejected the appeal.
""We are of the view the charge is not time-barred, so the application of the defence must fail,"" Judge Esther Toh ruled on Friday as she agreed with the prosecutors' interpretation of how to calculate that window. 

The case has been adjourned to January 2. The trial is expected to last about 80 days and will be decided by a judge rather than a jury.
The 76-year-old Lai founded the now shutdown Chinese-language tabloid Apple Daily — a pro-democracy newspaper that was critical of Beijing.
He is a British citizen and his imprisonment has been condemned by the UK and the US, which have also demanded his release.
His case has gained international attention as it is being viewed by many as a litmus test for Hong Kong's political freedom and judicial independence.
Hong Kong is a former British colony and was handed over to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise that it would stay autonomous. The city's autonomous characteristics, however, have increasingly diminished in recent years as China exerts more and more influence on the city. Beijing regards Hong Kong as part of its territory.

Prosecutors in the nearby city of Stuttgart believe that the crime in June 2021 was motivated by antisemitic sentiment.
The man is alleged to have poured gasoline alongside a wall of the synagogue and then to have set it on fire.
The conflagration left burn marks on the facade and covered a window with soot.
No one was in the building at the time.
The man fled to Turkey following his crime but was arrested at the start of July when he returned to Germany.
The trial is expected to finish in January.
At the time, politicians condemned the attack and called for better protection of Jewish sites.
Antisemitic crimes have been increasing in Germany in recent years. The ongoing war between Israel and the militant Islamist group Hamas has led to an added upsurge in such crimes in the past few months.

In the immediate aftermath of the October 7 terror attacks on Israel by Hamas militants, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that authorities had increased the protection of Israeli and Jewish institutions in Germany.

In January or February, Germany will take part in the US-led protection mission in the Red Sea, as long as the parliament, the Bundestag, approves.
Bundestag approval is important when even one German soldier sets foot on foreign soil. As a parliamentary army, the Bundeswehr must be given a mandate by the Bundestag for every deployment.
The US has given the name Operation Prosperity Guardian to the mission, for which it has asked around 40 countries for support. In this case, the name says it all: From the point of view of many Western countries, this really is about safeguarding prosperity, specifically the prosperity supplied by safe and important shipping routes.
Countries such as France and the United Kingdom have already said they will take part, and Germany will likely join them soon. The mission comes after the increasing number of attacks by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen on cargo ships traveling to and from Asia through the Suez Canal.
Around 10% of global trade is handled on this route, and around 30% of container ship traffic. Last month, the area saw around 20 attacks on ships, with use of weapons such as combat drones and cruise missiles.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz's spokesperson, Steffen Hebestreit, confirmed this week that the German government is considering participating in the mission. And his choice of words already revealed that a mission is very likely.\
""There is a right to security. And there is freedom at sea and also on the high seas. And if this is threatened, then the international community is called upon to reduce such threats,"" he said.
But Christian Wagner, the spokesperson for Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, was a little more evasive. ""We are now examining this internally and, if we come to the decision that we should participate in this mission, we will also inform the Bundestag on what basis and with what mandate we will then propose it,"" he said.
The Bundeswehr was already involved in the fight against pirates in the Horn of Africa until April 2022, for example, the EU mandate for which runs until the end of 2024. Berlin is considering extending this mandate to include operations in the Red Sea.
In addition, one of the operational Bundeswehr frigates, the Hessen, will complete a mission in the Baltic Sea by the end of the year. The frigate would be ideal for relieving American or British ships in the Red Sea.
One thing is already clear. A majority of the Bundestag would certainly be in favor of such a deployment, whatever the exact mandate. Representatives of the governing coalition of center-left Social Democrats (SPD), Greens and neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP), have already signaled their approval.
""Germany is the third largest export nation in the world,"" Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, chair of the parliamentary defense committee, told the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. ""In this respect, blocking the movement of goods is relevant for all of us, and everyone will feel the effects if certain products or components no longer reach Europe.""
The conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), in opposition, is also well-disposed to such a deployment. ""Germany does have some restrictions on such deployments,"" Johann Wadephul, the CDU parliamentary group's foreign affairs expert, told DW. ""But the way I see it, we, including the opposition, naturally support the United Nations and this mission.""
At the same time, Wadephul also warned against excessive haste. ""The German Bundestag will convene in the second week of January, and the US is already present on the ground. Together with the UK, France and Italy, perhaps Spain too,"" he said. ""So it is not necessary for Germany to join this coalition immediately. But we are ready for a corresponding decision by the Bundestag, and we can prepare for the mission beforehand. So if our help is needed, we can contribute to the success of the naval mission.""

Many shipping companies, especially major ones such as the Danish group Moller-Maersk, are currently taking the time-consuming detour via the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, a detour that can lead to delays of up to two weeks.
The Houthis' capabilities were demonstrated by the capture of the freighter Galaxy Leader in November. The crew is still trapped on the ship to this day, even though numerous Western countries have called for their release.

https://www.dw.com/en/christmas-trees-part-of-german-leitkultur-says-cdus-merz/a-67794012,SOCIETY,Christmas trees part of German 'Leitkultur' says CDU's Merz 21.12.2023,"Friedrich Merz, leader of Germany's conservative opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Thursday returned to the contentious topic of defining the country's ""Leitkultur"" — which could be translated as ""guiding"" or ""leading"" or ""mainstream"" or even ""dominant"" culture in English — by suggesting that the purchase of a Christmas tree was an integral part thereof.
Speaking with the Funke Media Group, the outspoken politician said, ""When we talk about Leitkultur, about our way of life, then, for me, this includes buying a Christmas tree before Christmas.""
""It is part of our Western Christian-influenced identity,"" he continued, adding that it has been so for generations and as such influences today's children, who will continue it into the future.
Merz said he was surprised that such statements would spark accusations of religious intolerance, saying, ""I'm slightly astonished that it is apparently a problem for many when we say something like that.""  
The concept of Leitkultur has been part of German politics since the late 1990s but is still not particularly well defined.
It can often be ambiguous, for instance, whether the term lists examples of established German culture that migrants ought to accept and respect, or actually adopt themselves.
More liberal politicians often take offense to the concept, preferring to suggest immigrants integrate as part of Germany's multicultural society. Some critics of the concept saw a direct parallel to the concept of ""Germanization"" propagated by the Nazis.
Merz was careful in his comments published on Thursday at no point to take that extra step and say everyone should have a tree themselves. 
However, Merz as CDU leader has more aggressively championed the idea of Leitkultur than his predecessor Angela Merkel, and particularly the notion that there should be an onus on new arrivals to at least adapt to such customs, and in some cases to adopt them. 
Less than two weeks ago, the CDU released a blueprint for its vision of Germany's future. Among the policy points the paper highlighted was one entitled, ""The Courage to Embrace Leitkultur: Only those who acknowledge our dominant culture can integrate and become German citizens.""
Merz's comments drew mixed reactions online from politicians and observers alike but did thrust the term Leitkultur to the top of trending topics on social media websites like X, formerly Twitter, for most of Thursday.
One retired former German Cabinet minister, Ruprecht Polenz, interpreted Merz's comments as an implicit demand for people to buy Christmas trees. Given his background with the neoliberal FDP, which also lays importance on individual liberty and autonomy, he objected. 
""Respect and tolerance are crucial for the cultural climate in a pluralistic society. Indeed, both must be demanded. But that is something different to demanding certain practices from EVERYONE,"" he said. 
Green party politician Konstantin von Notz responded twice, first lamenting that the CDU's behavior under Merz ""looks like political self-destruction."" He added: ""They're betting totally unreservedly on populism, divisiveness and demagoguery. That's the way for the [party] to demolish itself."" 
But within nine minutes, following a series of critical replies and allusions to the Greens' struggles in opinion polls compared to the CDU, von Notz posted a picture of himself sat in front of his Christmas tree at home. 
""Leitkultur so close behind me that it prickles...,"" he wrote. ""So, now, everybody, stop this nonsense and enjoy yourselves!""
Volker Beck, a former Green party Bundestag member, said he considered Christmas trees, an angel atop them, choirs, the Nativity scene, German festive snacks and goose all to be part of the season in Germany.
""It's customs and tradition. So what? Guiding culture? Or culture,"" he pondered. 
An environmental lobby group, BUND, meanwhile posted links to its past studies about pesticides on Christmas trees. 
And finally, the satirical website Der Postillon rushed to put together its definitive picture gallery of examples of German Leitkultur, including everything from putting towels on sun loungers to socks with sandals, driving at racing speeds on highways, beer, stockpiling toilet paper and ""going to church once a year,"" presumably meaning around this time of year.
The first recorded Christmas tree was placed in the Cathedral of Strasbourg in the 16th century by German Lutherans, and the idea started to catch on in public places thereafter. But the idea of having a tree at home started to gain popularity in 18th and 19th century among Germany's bourgeoisie. The practice was firmly embedded all social classes by the late 19th century.










Merz hails from Germany's Christmas tree capital, the western Sauerland region of Westphalia, which supplies many of the estimated 30 million trees put up in households and businesses across the country each December.

https://www.dw.com/en/russia-putins-rival-navalny-is-missing-what-do-we-know/a-67794097,POLITICS,Russia: Putin's rival Navalny is missing — what do we know? 21.12.2023,"It's been weeks since the lawyers of Alexei Navalny were able to contact the Kremlin critic, who was serving a 19-year prison sentence in a Russian penal colony. Even his closest associates appear stumped — despite years of experience in grappling with Russia's police, courts and prisons, Navalny's team has been unable to locate him, or even determine if the politician is alive or dead.
Talking with DW Russian last week, the head of Navalny's anti-corruption watchdog FBK Ivan Zhdanov said Navalny was ""most likely being transferred"" to a different prison, but also emphasized his team knew ""nothing"" about the politician's fate. As time goes on, however, activists are growing increasingly worried, especially with Navalny appearing ill on camera just days before his disappearance in early December.
""No, we can't be sure [that Navalny is still alive]"" Navalny's spokesperson Kira Yarmysh told German public broadcaster ZDF in an interview published on Wednesday.
""No prisoner had ever simply disappeared for so long, especially not such an important prisoner,"" she added.
The 47-year-old has made a name for himself by publicly calling out graft at the top of the Kremlin hierarchy. He is the founder of the FBK, and was one of the leaders of the anti-government protests in 2011-2013, which culminated in him running for the mayor of Moscow in 2013. He has called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""madman"" and said the ruling party in Russia was full of ""crooks and thieves.""

Over the years, Navalny has faced physical attacks, repeated arrests, investigations, and criminal proceedings, which he claims to be politically motivated. Most notably, he survived an assassination attempt in 2020 which involved the nerve agent Novichok. After the Novichok poisoning, Russian officials agreed to fly comatose Navalny out to Germany for treatment, with Navalny waking up and eventually recovering in Berlin's Charite hospital. However, with Navalny staying in Germany for several months after his release from the hospital, Russian authorities warned he was in violation of probation terms of an earlier court case and threatened to arrest him upon return.
Despite the warning, Navalny chose to return to Moscow in January 2021. Russian authorities detained him at the airport, and the politician has been behind bars ever since. While serving the sentence for the parole violation, he was sentenced to nine years for embezzlement and contempt of court. Another court ruling in August this year saw his prison term prolonged to 19 years over additional charges including extremism.
In October, three lawyers who once represented Navalny were detained on charges of being involved in an extremist group, and are still in pre-trial detention. Navalny and his allies have decried the move as an attempt at intimidation.
On December 6, Navalny was due to meet his defense team in the penal colony in Kovrov, some 260 kilometers (162 miles) northeast of Moscow. His lawyers reached the facility and waited, but were not allowed to see him. The same scenario played out in the next two days.
Navalny also missed multiple court appointments in the days following his apparent disappearance. Initially, Russian officials said power outages prevented them from establishing a video link to the courtroom and allowing Navalny to participate. Eventually, they announced that the jailed politician had been ""moved"" from Kovrov to a different correctional facility outside of the administrative region.
The authorities have yet to provide the name and the location of the new facility. In a court document dated December 12, correctional officials pledged that Navalny's arrival to the new site will be reported ""within the framework of the existing legislation."" At least two court hearing have been postponed until January.
The terse comment from Russia's correctional authority provides a sliver of hope for Navalny's supporters, as it could be interpreted as a clue that the Kremlin critic is currently being transferred to a new prison.
Notably, the August verdict against Navalny contained a stipulation of him being relocated to a ""special regime"" penal colony. In Russia, these maximum security colonies are usually reserved for particularly dangerous repeated criminals, people sentenced to life in prison, and inmates on death row (Russia imposed a death penalty moratorium in 1996).  Transporting prisoners to these sites is usually done by train and, with Russia's immense size, the journey can take weeks.















On Wednesday, FBK head Zhdanov said Navalny is either being transported somewhere in strict secrecy, or he has already been relocated and is now being kept in full isolation.
""A very small number of people know about Navalny being held [there] otherwise something would definitely have leaked from the system,"" he said in an online video.
Zhdanov and his associates have been systematically contacting multiple prison facilities across the country, asking them if Navalny is on site. These efforts have so far been unsuccessful
Last week, Russian news outlet Baza reported Navalny was in Moscow for ""investigative activities"" but his team was not able to verify these reports. Zhdanov also offered a reward for information on the politician's whereabouts.
Navalny's disappearance came just a day before his aides launched a wide-reaching political campaign ""Russia without Putin."" The initiative is aimed against Putin's plans to secure a fifth presidential term in the upcoming presidential election in March 2024.
When asked for comment last week, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the government had ""neither the intention, nor the capacity to track the fates of prisoners.""

In his DW interview last week, Zhdanov drew a link between the campaign and Navalny's fate. Navalny's disappearance was an attempt to isolate the Putin rival, according to Zhdanov.
""I don't believe in such coincidences — that Alexei goes missing just as we are about to announce our electoral campaign, a day before Vladimir Putin announcing he would run for president for an infinite new term. It's not a coincidence, it's the Kremlin strategy,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/can-india-tackle-deepfakes/a-67791106,TECHNOLOGY,Can India tackle deepfakes? 21.12.2023,"Deepfakes are fast becoming a problem and are used to spread misinformation online as India grapples with the treacherous costs of a rapidly evolving AI technology.
The concerns come after a series of recent deepfake incidents involving top Indian film stars and personalities prompted the government to meet social media platforms, artificial intelligence companies and industry bodies, to come up with a ""clear, actionable plan"" to tackle the issue.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said deepfakes were one of the biggest threats faced by the country, and warned people to be careful with new technology amid a rise in AI-generated videos and pictures.
""We have to be careful with new technology. If these are used carefully, they can be very useful. However, if these are misused, it can create huge problems. You must be aware of deepfake videos made with the help of generative AI,"" Modi said on Wednesday.

The proliferation of online deepfake videos has surged by 550%, reaching a staggering 95,820, as revealed in the 2023 State of Deepfakes report by Home Security Heroes, a US-based organization.
The report identifies India as the sixth most susceptible country to this emerging threat.
Cybercriminals use facial mapping technologies to create an accurate facial symmetry dataset. They use AI to swap the face of a person onto the face of another person. As well as this, voice matching technology is used to accurately copy the user's voice.
Apprehensive of AI-generated deepfakes and misinformation, the government last month issued an advisory to all social media platforms reminding them of the legal obligations that require them to promptly identify and take down misinformation.
Experts have pointed out that India lacks specific laws to address deepfakes and AI-related crimes, but provisions under several pieces of legislation under the IT Act could offer both civil and criminal relief.
Others have pointed out that though deepfakes have challenged the legal system across the world, a practical solution is available.

Pranesh Prakash, a law and policy consultant, told DW that although there's moral panic about deepfakes that is disconnected from the actual harm posed by the technology, it was necessary to approach the problem by clearly identifying harms and identifying gaps in the existing law.
""The IT minister has said that regulations will be passed urgently, but it is unclear what precise problem he's seeking to solve nor what legal provision he's proposing to use for the proposed action,"" said Prakash, who is also a co-founder of the Bangalore-based Centre for Internet and Society nonprofit.
""Clearly, engaging in fraud by using deepfakes is a problem, but we already have laws that cover fraud and impersonation for fraud. The government needs to clarify what lacunae exist in the law that they are seeking to address,"" he said.
""Multi-stakeholders must be involved to work toward eliminating this problem including tech companies, society and the government as there is a lacuna in the law,"" Anushka Jain, research associate at Digital Futures Lab, told DW.
Cyber law expert Pavan Duggal said with no dedicated law on AI, identifying the originator of deepfakes and the first transmitter of deepfakes is a big challenge.
""With most of these service providers in India not wanting to share information about deepfake originators because of potential impact it may have upon them loosing statutory exemption from legal liability, the time has come for India to take more effective action in terms of legal provisions on deep fakes,"" Duggal told DW.
""Further, trying to detect, investigate and prosecute deepfake crimes will involve need for adopting more effective tools and new mindset approaches as far as law enforcement agencies are concerned, because technology is moving at a rapid pace and the legal frameworks and political will also needs to keep pace,"" he added.
Google, one of the largest tech companies in the world, has already said it will work with the Indian government to address the safety and security risks posed by deepfake and disinformation campaigns.

""There is no silver bullet to combat deep fakes and AI-generated misinformation. It requires a collaborative effort, one that involves open communication, rigorous risk assessment and proactive mitigation strategies,"" said Michaela Browning of Google Asia Pacific, ahead of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence Summit in New Delhi.
Modi inaugurated the event last week to arrive at a consensus on a declaration document on the proper use of AI, the guardrails for the technology and how it can be democratized.
Jency Jacob, managing editor of BOOM, a leading fact-checking website which has been closely studying the issue, said deepfake videos are becoming a cause of worry and there are valid concerns, especially during an election season.
""Governments around the world are still working on a policy response but we are yet to see anything that sounds like a plan. The Indian government has also shared its concerns and it will be interesting to see how they use existing laws and new provisions to protect victims,"" Jacob told DW.

https://www.dw.com/en/red-sea-attacks-why-arab-nations-wont-join-naval-coalition/a-67790545,CONFLICTS,Red Sea attacks: Why Arab nations won't join naval coalition 21.12.2023,"When the US announced a naval coalition to protect commercial vessels traveling in the Red Sea earlier this week, the Americans initially said there would be 10 countries taking part. Questions arose almost immediately about why some of the largest Arab naval powers were not.
Since mid-November, the Houthi rebel group in Yemen has been firing rockets and sending drones to harass ships traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. A senior Houthi official said on social media that this won't stop ""until the crimes of genocide in Gaza are stopped and food, medicine and fuel are allowed to enter its besieged population.""
""Enmity with Israel is a strategic raison d'etre for the Houthis,"" Daniel Gerlach, an expert on the region, told DW recently. ""It's part of their claim that Israel is their main enemy, although actually there is of course no direct territorial conflict with Israel. [But] they want to show the entire Muslim and the Arab world that they're on the side of the Palestinians.""
On November 19, the rebel group, which has been involved in a civil war at home since 2015 and now controls a large part of the country, hijacked the Galaxy Leader, a cargo ship co-owned by an Israeli businessman.
Other ships have been attacked with drones and in one case, another ship was even briefly boarded.
The harassment has mostly happened in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait which connects the Gulf of Aden with the Red Sea and is 32 kilometers (about 20 miles) wide at its narrowest point. It allows ships access to the Suez Canal, the shortest way between Europe and Asia.
As a result, several major shipping companies have suspended operations passing through the strait.
The proposed US naval coalition to protect commercial shipping against Houthi threats is called Operation Prosperity Guardian.""The US has invited all 38 other members of what is known as the Combined Maritime Forces, or CMF, a US-led maritime security coalition in the Middle East, to join it. 
So far, only nine countries have publicly said they will join the US: Bahrain, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the Seychelles and the UK. 
But almost immediately, questions were raised. The Spanish government denied it had joined, the French were worried their participation might distract from other operations and the Italians said their ship would remain under Italian command.
But one of the biggest question marks was around the absence of any larger Middle Eastern nations. Bahrain is the only Middle Eastern nation involved so far. But this is no surprise: the small nation is home to the US Navy's 5th Fleet.
The Suez Canal belongs to Egypt and is an important source of revenue — up to $10 billion annually — for the country, which is already dealing with an economic crisis.
Egypt is also a member of CMF. Operation Prosperity Guardian will operate under the auspices of the CMF's Task Force 153, which focuses on Red Sea security, as well monitoring Iran and countering Somalian piracy. Egypt took on the rotating command of Task Force 153 late last year.
Even though it's likely losing millions because of the blockage of the Suez Canal, Egypt has not criticized the Houthi attacks nor has it openly joined the naval coalition.
Experts have said this is most likely because of Egypt's proximity to the conflict and the sensitivity about this issue in the Arab world in general.
Saudi Arabia is also a member of the US-led CMF. However, the Saudis have also recently been fostering detente with the Houthis on one hand, and the Houthi's sponsors in Iran, on the other.
Saudi Arabia has led a military coalition against the Houthis in Yemen's civil war since 2015. The oil-rich country has recently been trying to extricate itself from that conflict, which is more or less at a stalemate, and have been involved in peace talks .
Experts conclude the Saudis have not joined the naval coalition because they are concerned this would scupper those peace talks, and possibly even damage newly relaxed relations with Iran.
There is also the possibility that the Houthis strike at Saudi oil depots again, the way they did in 2019 with devastating effect. The Houthis have threatened to attack these, should either the UAE or Saudi Arabia join the new naval coalition.
By all accounts, the United Arab Emirates is interested in a more hard-line position against the Houthis, even though it has not joined the naval coalition.
The UAE and Saudi Arabia ""have differing views on how to approach the Houthi problem,"" James Stavridis a retired US Navy admiral, wrote in an op-ed for Bloomberg this week. ""The UAE is calling for strong military action against the rebels, while Riyadh wants a more measured approach. They need to be persuaded to put this spat aside.""
In May, the UAE said it would be leaving the multinational CMF, although this has not yet been formalized, Eleonora Ardemagni, a researcher at the Italian Institute for International Political Studies, told Beirut-based newspaper L'Orient-Le Jour this week.
The UAE is ""not satisfied with Washington's security response in the Middle East, which has been deemed too weak in recent years,"" Ardemagni explained. ""But they remain in favor of a firm response, aimed at undermining the Houthis' military capabilities and reducing the threat to commercial shipping because, unlike the Saudis, they are not engaged in bilateral negotiations.""
Concern about Houthi attacks on UAE oil fields could be another an issue.
Analysts have also said that the one thing the three Red Sea powers have in common is the fact that they don't necessarily want to be seen as working in defense of Israel.
Opinion polls regularly show the issue of Palestinian statehood has huge resonance among people in the Middle East. Because of this, Middle Eastern leaders tend to pay lip service to it even if they don't actually want to do much about it.
For the past few years, the US has encouraged cooperation between Israel and the Gulf countries in order to combat Iranian influence, Camille Lons, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, noted last week.
""Now the war in Gaza means that Red Sea security cooperation is unlikely to happen anytime soon, as Arab Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia are now unwilling to proceed with Israeli normalisation.""
Perhaps even more interesting: There are actually another nine countries who will participate in the new naval coalition but who don't want to go public with their participation, sources inside the US administration have told journalists.
The US' national security spokesperson John Kirby confirmed this at a press briefing on Tuesday. Asked why the Saudis and the UAE didn't appear on the list of possible coalition members, Kirby replied that, ""there are some nations that have agreed to participate and to be a part of this but they get to decide — they're sovereign nations — how public they want that to be.""

https://www.dw.com/en/indias-parliament-debates-murthys-70-hour-work-week/a-67789049,BUSINESS,India's parliament debates Murthy's 70-hour work week 21.12.2023,"Recent comments by Indian tech-billionaire and co-founder of India's second largest IT company Infosys Narayana Murthy ended up being the topic of discussion in the Lok Sabha — the lower house of the Indian Parliament.
The father-in-law of UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Murthy's remarks prompted three members of parliament to raise the issue during a parliamentary session, asking the ruling government if it was considering the suggestion to raise the number of working hours to 70 per week. The parliament, however, did not endorse the request of the parliamentarians.
Murthy's suggestion appeared to touch a nerve with many Indians, sparking a debate.
Murthy, in a recent podcast with former Infosys CFO Mohandas Pai, said: ""India's work productivity is one of the lowest in the world. Unless we improve our work productivity... we will not be able to compete with those countries that have made tremendous progress. Therefore, my request is that our youngsters must say, 'This is my country. I'd like to work 70 hours a week.'""

According to the UN's International Labour Organization (ILO), India has a workforce of 524 million people, of which 85% finds itself employed in very low paying jobs, while 95% of this unorganized sector is informally employed, meaning they have no written contracts, paid leaves, social security or any healthcare benefits.
""A 70-hour working week would be a reversion to the 19th Century Dickensian era of severe exploitation of ordinary workers,"" Rajiv Biswas, Executive Director and Asia-Pacific Chief Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, told DW.
In its latest report published in 2023, the ILO says that Indians already work 47.7 hours a week, considerably more than highly industrialized, developed economies, like those of Japan or Germany, examples cited by 77-year-old Murthy. Although Indians work the seventh longest hours compared to anyone in the world, corresponding productivity is not as high. The comparison to Germany and Japan, both statistically more productive nations with considerably fewer hours working hours, only serves to heighten the debate.
Unlike the unorganized sector, to which an overwhelming majority of the working population of India belongs, large corporations or private sector employers in the organized sector are the ones to enforce set working hours or define employer duties and responsibilities.

""No organization will benefit by adopting exploitative conditions for its workers,"" say Rajiv Biswas. ""Any company adopting such disgraceful practices could face severe regulatory hurdles for its products in other nations that have best practice ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) standards.""
From the perspectives of both the employee and the employer, equating working hours with productivity remains problematic and without concrete conclusions about its viability.
A country's industry and productivity are largely shaped by political will and government policies. In India, it is no different. Good market performance has to follow labor laws, regulations and the implementation of such laws.
There has been widespread criticism of the ills of a lopsided work-life balance, not just in India but also across the globe, citing rising mental health issues. According to the report published by India's National Sample Survey (NSS), the country is facing an unprecedented mental health crisis.
According to the International Monetary Fund, only 17% of Indians are employed in the organized sector, which includes both private and government jobs.

The debate surrounding longer working hours, passionate nation building and actual outcomes, has intensified in the wake of Murthy's comments.
A 2021 study by Expert Market suggested that working overtime or long hours does not necessarily equate to increased productivity. The workforces of 42 countries around the world were examined, with Luxembourg topping the list with 34 hours a week. .
Economist Rajiv Biswas told DW that ""India's path forward in terms of boosting productivity will be built on large-scale investment in modern infrastructure, adoption of advanced technology and productivity enhancement through Artificial Intelligence and Industrial Automation.""

https://www.dw.com/en/a-radical-humanist-israeli-philosopher-omri-boehm/a-67790075,CULTURE,A radical humanist: Israeli philosopher Omri Boehm 21.12.2023,"Omri Boehm is a former employee of Israel's Shin Bet secret service. He is also a staunch human rights defender who dreams of a state that upholds equal rights for both Jews and Arabs.
The philosopher's concept of ""humanistic universalism,"" as articulated in his 2022 book, ""Radical Universalism. Beyond Identity,"" has earned Boehm the Leipzig Book Prize for European Understanding.
Endowed with €20,000 ($21,855), the prize will be presented during the opening of the Leipzig Book Fair in March, 2024.
The jury honored Boehm for his ""obligation to recognize the equality of all human beings, against any relativization.""
In ""Radical Universalism. Beyond identity,"" the author ""resolutely opposes the ideological hardening of the present,"" said the jury.
Omri Boehm is uncompromising when defending his ideas.
In his 2020 pamphlet ""Israel. A Utopia,"" he describes Zionism as incompatible with humanist values and argues for a rethinking of Israeli statehood.
As also articulated in his 2021 book, ""Haifa Republic: A Democratic Future,"" Boehm does not advocate for a separate Palestinian state. His ""utopia"" is an Israeli-Palestinian federation — one country for both peoples.
Even after the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 and the subsequent outbreak of war, Boehm reaffirmed his position in an interview with Der Spiegel magazine.
""We are dealing with an intolerable situation where the impossible is necessary,"" he said. ""We must find proposals for a political solution in the future. The only alternative to unlimited war is the compromise of a federation.""
Boehm was born in Haifa in 1979 and grew up in a small village in the Galilee region of northern Israel along with his German Jewish grandmother and Iranian Jewish grandfather.
He did his military service with the Israeli domestic secret service, Shin Bet.
But he was an elite student who ultimately completed his doctorate in philosophy at Yale University on ""Kant's Critique of Spinoza.""
Holding both Israeli and German citizenship, Boehm has conducted postdoctoral studies and research in Munich and Berlin.
Today, Omri Boehm lives in the US, where since 2010 he's been an associate professor of philosophy at New York's New School for Social Research.
In addition to his research and teaching work, he writes about Israeli politics in international newspapers such as Haaretz, Die Zeit and The New York Times.
As the jury of the Leipzig Book Prize put it, Omri Boehm is not afraid to give ""metaphysical justifications"" for the universal rights of all people.
The sought-after voice on the Middle East conflict continues to call for a ""bi-national state"" where two peoples live side-by-side.
As he argued in ""Haifa Republic,"" preeminent Zionists like Theodor Herzl and Ze'ev Jabotinsky, who founded Israel, advocated such a federation where Jews and Arabs resided together on the same land.

Interviewed by Swiss broadcaster SRF in November, Boehm posited that universalism also includes the idea that ""the lives of uninvolved civilians in Gaza have to be defended like the lives of Israeli Jews.""
He said that the premise of ""imagining a life together with Palestinians"" will also require that Palestinians ""condemn both sides"" in the conflict, meaning Hamas. 
The Leipzig Book Prize for European Understanding has been awarded since 1994 and is one of the most important literary awards in Germany. The prize committee is made up of the Free State of Saxony, the City of Leipzig, the German Publishers and Booksellers Association, and the Leipzig Book Fair.
Omri Boehm will be awarded the prize at the opening of the Leipzig Book Fair on March 20 in the Leipzig Gewandhaus. The laudatory speech will be given by the French-Israeli sociologist Eva Illouz, a friend and companion of Boehm.

Across the political spectrum, observers see burgeoning vitriol and prejudice. In the past two months, lone perpetrators have committed a trio of fatal terror attacks, claiming four lives in total.
In Belgium, two Swedish football fans were shot dead in October in an apparent retribution for Quran burnings in their home country. In France, a teacher and a tourist were stabbed in two separate incidents, the second perpetrator having reportedly pledged allegiance to the so-called Islamic State (IS).

Earlier this month, European Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson, herself from Sweden, said: ""With the war between Israel and Hamas and the polarization it causes in our society, with the upcoming holiday season, there is a huge risk of terrorist attacks in the European Union.""
Johansson's assessment is alarming, but in the EU, the individual member states, not the European Commission, control risk assessment. In the past few months, authorities in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden have all increased their alert levels, citing the risk of Islamist terror — generally concentrated in Western Europe — but also from the far right.
""The danger is real and greater than it has been for a long time,"" Thomas Haldenwang, the head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, wrote earlier this month.
In December, authorities in Germany and the Netherlands detained four individuals allegedly linked to Hamas, the Palestinian militant group responsible for the October 7 terror attacks on Israel, over suspicion of plotting to obtain weapons for at least nine months. German prosecutors said these could have been used to target Jewish institutions.
Thomas Renard, the director of the International Center for Counterterrorism in the Netherlands, said the heightened alert was about more than the conflict in Gaza. It is linked to a partial resurgence of radical Islamist groups like IS and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Syria.
""The terrorist threat is much higher now than it was two or three years ago,"" Renard said.
The attacks carried out within the European Union since early October were on a much smaller scale and less coordinated than those executed in Paris and Brussels by actors claiming allegiance to IS in 2015 and 2016.
""In the peak of the [IS-declared] caliphate, we were facing a highly organized structured group, extremely powerful, extremely attractive, so to speak, that really could attract tens of thousands of individuals from around the world,"" Renard said.
That is not the case for the time being, he said. Though the present situation is concerning, authorities also learned from the wave of attacks inspired or directed by IS in Europe, he added.
These days, relevant agencies in the European Union are much better at sharing information between national law enforcement and intelligence agencies, as well as with other member states. ""It does not always work perfectly, obviously,"" he said. ""It works much better than it used to. There's much more information flowing.""

Renard said member states, at least those most affected in Western Europe, were also spending much more money on counterterrorism. Whereas intelligence services used to focus heavily on the detection of advanced plots, authorities now tend to think more broadly, Renard said.
""Nowadays, there is a much more comprehensive response that has been put in place, starting with early prevention,"" Renard said. Efforts start locally, involving prevention officers, civil society organizations and educational institutions.
On the other hand, radicalization can be harder to detect. ""It's much more sort of underground nowadays. So it's much harder to know who is going to take action or not,"" he said.
Renard said the heightened alert was also coming from the far right, a threat that had tended to be overlooked until recent years. ""If a terrorist attack were to occur tomorrow, it's more likely to be a jihadi attack than a far-right attack. But basically, it's almost a very similar risk,"" Renard said.
In 2022, 16 terror attacks took place in the EU and a further 12 failed or were foiled, according to Europol. Four people died, two in jihadi attacks and two from right-wing terror. In the IS peak years of 2015 and 2016, 151 and 142 people, respectively, were killed.
Reports of antisemitism and Islamophobia were increasing before the October 7 Hamas-led terror attacks in southern Israel that killed nearly 1,200 people and the Israeli military response that has killed more than 20,000 over the past two months, Human Rights Watch wrote on Monday. There have been several concerning incidents in recent weeks throughout Europe.
""A German lawmaker of Kurdish-Syrian background received threatening notes with glass and feces. A Polish lawmaker brandishing a fire extinguisher put out Hanukkah candles in the Parliament building. A pig's head was left near the site for a proposed mosque in England. A wave of antisemitic graffiti appeared in Paris and its suburbs,"" the group listed.
As part of the HRW report, researcher Almaz Teffera said the European Union's problems went much deeper than the recent flurry of violent attacks. ""We have now seen international attention and condemnation around the latest rise of this hate, and rightly so, but what doesn't make headlines are the decades of lived experiences of communities facing racism and intolerance, particularly anti-Muslim hate and antisemitism, every day,"" she wrote in an interview published Monday by HRW.
In Europe, politicians and the media tend to focus on full-blown terror attacks, Renard said. While low in number, they are high in impact, he explained, often creating a ""collective trauma"" for the wider population.
Online hatred and desecrating Jewish schools or mosques may not qualify as acts of terrorism, but such violent extremism is of grave concern for authorities, he said.
""When we talk [about] terrorism, we're talking about the tip of the iceberg,"" he said. ""It's important to realize that the risk to citizens and the risk to a democracy might be impacted even by more violent extremism than terrorism.""

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-braces-for-potential-new-years-eve-riots/a-67787686,RULE OF LAW,Germany braces for potential New Year's Eve riots 21.12.2023,"Germany's Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said she fears a repeat of New Year rioting and attacks on emergency services in Berlin and other cities.
""I'm worried that New Year's Eve could once again be a day on which we are forced to experience blind rage and senseless violence in some cities, for example, against police officers or emergency services,"" Faeser told the RND media group in comments published on Thursday.
At the start of 2023, at least 41 police officers were hurt in the capital alone, and there were dozens of attacks on emergency responders.
There were reports firetrucks were supposedly ""lured into ambushes"" and shot at with fireworks and pelted with stones and beer crates in cities including Cologne, Hamburg and Dortmund.
""For me, this uninhibited violence is completely incomprehensible and cannot be justified by anything,"" Faeser said.
The dramatic scenes of streets ablaze to the sound of gunfire from blank-firing pistols as fireworks reignited the debate about a potential ban on the sale of fireworks.
Fireworks fill store shelves this year starting on December 28, but Faeser said authorities are making more preparations to deal with potential violence this year than they have in the past.
""I know that the federal states and their police forces are now preparing for this differently than last time: with new risk assessments, with more police,"" she said. ""I am particularly grateful to the emergency services who are putting their necks on the line for our safety.""

Gemany's police union pushed for harsher penalties for the perpetrators of violence against emergency service staff, and the fire service called for the use of more body cams to be able to prove that acts of violence have taken place.
""On days like New Year's Eve, we now see a general increase in violence,"" Faeser continued, ""and, of course, we have to keep a very close eye on the danger of this mixing with radicalization, which we are now seeing in light of the Middle East conflict.""
In January, Berlin police said 145 people were arrested in connection with the New Year's Eve violence in the capital, including 38 people who were specifically detained in connection with attacks on the police and emergency services staff.
Of those, two-thirds were German nationals and the majority were under 21.

Some people in Germany were quick to blame the violence on people with migrant backgrounds. At the time the federal government's Anti-Discrimination Commissioner Ferda Ataman, however, warned that there was no justification for what she described as the ""racist reactions"" to the New Year's Eve violence.

https://www.dw.com/en/france-toughens-its-anti-migration-stance/a-67785814,MIGRATION,France toughens its anti-migration stance 21.12.2023,"It's been over a year since French President Emmanuel Macron pledged that his government would aim to implement a ""balanced"" reform to immigration laws. The aim was to have a law that would prevent irregular migration and facilitate the deportation of asylum-seekers whose claims had been rejected, but that would also encourage the integration of working migrants.
However, in the parliamentary elections in the summer of 2022, Macron's governing coalition lost its absolute majority in France's National Assembly. The second parliamentary chamber is already dominated by the center-right Republicans (Les Republicains), who have shifted further rightward in recent years, under pressure from the far-right National Rally led by Marine Le Pen.
The Senate had already removed a central point of the reform early on in the proceedings. Migrants will not be granted permanent residency in France, even if they find jobs in industries with a shortage of workers. The government then had to make further difficult concessions in the joint committee consisting of seven senators and seven deputies.
The new immigration law will put France on the same anti-migration course that has recently been adopted by other European states, notably the Nordic countries.
The government has made significant concessions to the conservative opposition parties, especially on residence permits and access to social benefits. People without employment will have to wait five years before they become eligible for child benefit, the enforceable right to housing or personal support for freelancers. For immigrants with jobs, the waiting period will be two-and-a-half years.
Access to housing benefits was a particular bone of contention between the governing parties and the Republicans.
Foreigners from outside the EU will now only be eligible for housing benefits when they have been resident in France for five years. However, those who have a job, are studying or who are recognized asylum-seekers will receive this support after three months' residency.
Migrants without residence permits — so-called sans papiers — are often the subject of heated debate in France. The rules are being tightened for them as well.
State representatives in the French regions (prefects) will in future have the authority to grant residence permits to these individuals, if they are working in occupations where there is a labor shortage, have been living in France for at least three years and have been employed for at least the past 12 months. However, the residence permits will only be valid for one year.
One concession from the opposition to the government is that employees will be able to apply for this residence permit without having to obtain their employer's consent. The ""sans-papiers reform"" is initially being classified as an experiment, applicable only until 2026.
Being in France irregularly will once again become a criminal offense, punishable by one year in prison and a fine of €3,750 ($4,105). The Republicans' party leader, Eric Ciotti, received assurances from Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin that he would expedite the construction of deportation centers. Eleven new ""administrative reception centers"" are due to open in France by 2027.
Although the government considers it unconstitutional for parliament to impose quotas on immigration, the compromise law does include such a regulation for the next three years. The cap will apply to non-EU foreigners — with an exemption for asylum-seekers. Many politicians in both the presidential camp and the left-wing opposition hope the Constitutional Council will overturn this regulation upon review.
In the Senate on Tuesday evening, Darmanin, who himself was previously a member of the Republicans, described some parts of the law as unconstitutional. President Macron also seems to have doubts.
Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said in a radio interview: ""The president will appeal to the Constitutional Council, and the Constitutional Council will determine where things stand.""
Foreign citizens born in France will no longer automatically receive French citizenship when they reach adulthood. They will have to apply for it between the ages of 16 and 18. Anyone convicted of a crime will no longer be naturalized.
Dual citizens can have their French citizenship revoked if they are convicted of the deliberate homicide of a public official. This regulation is intended to protect state employees such as police officers, firefighters and teachers.
Additionally, lawmakers have resolved on stricter rules for family reunification, and decreed that students will have to pay a deposit to cover the costs of potential deportation. Access to health insurance is also being made more difficult for foreigners.
Marine Le Pen, the National Rally (RN) leader, described the compromise as an ""ideological victory"" for her party, and immediately announced that her parliamentary group had approved it.
""National priority status — that is, preference given to French people over foreigners for certain social benefits — is now finally law,"" said Le Pen, whose party currently leads in the polls. All 88 RN deputies voted for the new law in the French National Assembly on Tuesday night, as did the Republicans' 62 deputies.
The presidential camp would not have had a majority without the support of the right-wingers. Twenty-seven deputies from the governing parties voted against the tougher immigration laws, while 32 abstained. After the vote, Health Minister Aurelien Rousseau resigned in protest. The consequences of tensions in the government camp will likely become apparent over the coming days.
On the other side of the political spectrum, the left-wing opposition accused the government of a ""total loss of dignity"" if it passed the law with the support of the Republicans and the National Rally. Migrants and refugees, who see the reform as introducing new and harsher measures, had protested against the plans.

https://www.dw.com/en/christmas-fails-to-bring-holiday-cheer-for-german-retailers/a-67787339,BUSINESS,Christmas fails to bring holiday cheer for German retailers 21.12.2023,"The festive holiday season has not brought cheer to small-business owners and retail shopkeepers in Germany as Christmas shopping did not offer a boost, according to a survey published on Thursday.
German retailers remain gloomy about their earning prospects in the upcoming months, too, according to the report released by the Munich-based Ifo Institute.
""For many retailers, business in the first weeks of the holiday season wasn't as good as they had hoped,"" Ifo's Patrick Höppner said.

Sellers of toys and consumer electronics, as well as of electrical goods and electronic household appliances, were more pessimistic about their business prospects in December than they were in November.
These products are commonly sold during the Christmas season and make up a significant chunk of the retailers' annual sales.
The economic institute said its business situation indicator for retail slumped to -12.1 in the final month of the year, down from -8.8 in November.
Improving its inflation rates from last year, Germany — the biggest economy in Europe — has seen a steady decline in inflation this year. The inflation rate in November stood at 2.3% compared to a peak of 11.6% in October 2022.
However, the chances of a bump in inflation rates are still rife as the government plans to cut subsidies and introduce new taxation rules in the 2024 budget.
""Customers continue to exercise noticeable restraint, and this is likely to give retailers a difficult start to 2024,"" Hoeppner said.

Merz leads the conservative CDU, the main opposition to Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-way coalition government.
He called for more work to strengthen the German-French partnership and hailed an EU deal to reform asylum policies.
He said that he and Macron agreed that ""we need to do more to invigorate the spirit of German-French cooperation.""
Merz thanked Macron for what he called a ""very good exchange on the current situation in the world, the future of Europe, and the strengthening of our economy.""
The opposition leader did not want to comment on the content of a recent immigration law passed by France, but said he saw it as a call to action for Scholz's government.
""France has made its decision, German is still waiting for a decision,"" Merz said.
The new legislation extends the duration of stay in France for migrants to be eligible to access welfare benefits, and makes it harder for the children of immigrants to acquire French citizenship. It also makes it easier for migrants working in sectors that are affected by shortages to get a residency permit.
The bill won support from the far-right National Rally (RN), led by Marine Le Pen, who called the legislation ""a great ideological victory"" for the far right.
Speaking after meeting Macron, Merz ruled out the possibility of working with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).
""This will not happen in the CDU under my leadership,"" he said, referring to potential alliances with the AfD.
Merz argued that asylum and migration policies should be made at the EU level whenever possible.
""A lot is possible [at the EU level], as the last few hours have shown,"" he said.
On Wednesday, EU member states struck a deal to reform the bloc's migration policy. The agreement includes provisions for faster screening of irregular arrivals, the creation of border detention centers and faster deportation procedures after asylum requests are rejected.
It also includes a solidarity mechanism to reduce the pressure on the states receiving the largest quantity of arrivals.

https://www.dw.com/en/yemens-houthis-are-an-iran-backed-militant-group/a-67780324,CONFLICTS,Yemen's Houthis are an Iran-backed militant group 20.12.2023,"For weeks now, the Houthi rebel group in Yemen has been attacking ships of all kinds on the Red Sea, using drones and other weapons. The attacks are part of what the fighters say is their support for the Palestinian cause and the militant Hamas group in Gaza.
Since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,140 people, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been bombing the Gaza Strip, which is home to more than 2 million Palestinians. Hamas is classified as a terrorist organization by Germany, the European Union, the US and others.
Israel has also launched a ground offensive into the Gaza Strip and has blocked the delivery of most food, water, power and aid into the enclave. Fighting is ongoing and more than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza; US officials have suggested that the death toll is likely higher because people buried under rubble are still counted as missing.
The Houthis have said they will continue to attack every vessel on its way toward Israel until the IDF lifts the blockade on the Gaza Strip and allows food and other essentials in.
In mid-November, the Houthis managed to hijack one ship, the Galaxy Leader, which belongs to an Israeli businessman. 
The threats are being taken seriously. Several major international freight companies have already said they won't be sending any more ships through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and will reroute them on a longer and more expensive course. 
Connecting the Gulf of Aden with the Red Sea, the strait is one of the most important in the world. It sees about 12% of world shipping traffic transiting here, on their way to the Suez Canal, the shortest shipping route between Europe and Asia. To get there, vessels must pass off the coast of Yemen.
This week, as a result of the ongoing threats posed by the Houthi group and the freight firms' announcements, the United States announced an international naval coalition, ""Operation Prosperity Guardian,"" to protect the vital sea passage. The countries taking part in the coalition alongside the US are Bahrain, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the Seychelles and the UK. 
The Houthis have also responded to the announcement of the naval coalition this week.
""Yemen's armed forces don't represent any threat to any country: We only target Israeli ships or ships heading toward Israeli ports,"" their statement said. ""We affirm our steadfast position in supporting the Palestinian people until Israel's aggression ends, and [the] siege on the Gaza strip is lifted.""
The Houthis derive from a tribal group out of the north of Yemen, near the border with Saudi Arabia.
By religious sect, the Houthis are Shiite Muslims but belong to a specific branch called the Zaydi Shiites.
As such, they have beliefs that sett them apart from mainstream Shiite Muslims. For instance they do not believe in the return of a messiah-like figure, the 12th imam. The twelve imams are considered to be the descendants of the Prophet Muhammad and the 12th imam is considered to have vanished but is expected to return one day.
Nonetheless, the fact that the Houthis are Shiite Muslims is important because this connects them to Iran, the country generally considered to represent Shiite interests in the region.
Zaydi Shiites make up about one-third of Yemen's population. The political and military movement goes back to the 1990s. The contemporary movement was founded by Hussein al-Houthi, a former Yemeni politician who opposed the policies, and alleged corruption, of former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was himself a Houthi. The group are named after Hussein al-Houthi.
After the Arab Spring protests of 2011 toppled Saleh's regime, the Houthis increasingly accused Yemen's new government — now headed by a Sunni Muslim — of marginalizing Zaydi Shiites. They also believed that the central government was too close to the US and thereby Israel, and that the current leader, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, was also a Saudi stooge.
The Houthis rebelled against Hadi's unpopular government in 2014 and began to take over large parts of the country, including the former capital, Sanaa. For the Saudis, who did indeed support Hadi, this was a major problem and they began to fight against the Houthis. The Saudis have been heading an international coalition fighting against the Houthis since 2015, but without great success.
In 2022, the opponents negotiated a six-month ceasefire. Even though this has since ended, the situation has remained comparatively calm in Yemen as all parties seemed to have come to the conclusion they're at a stalemate.
The war in Yemen has been described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis by the United Nations.
The Houthis' ideology can be deduced from their motto: ""God is great, death to the US, death to Israel, curse the Jews, and victory for Islam.""
In their territory in northern Yemen, they have adopted a strict Islamist order with an anti-Western and anti-Israel bent.
Since the 1990s, successive Yemeni governments have supported calls for Palestinian statehood and an end to the Israeli occupation. This was in common with most nations in the Middle east. The Houthi group has further radicalized this position and many locals are sympathetic to it. 
The Houthis are now considered close allies of the government in Iran. They see themselves as part of the so-called Axis of Resistance, an Iran-led regional alliance that also includes Hamas in Gaza, Lebanon's Hezbollah and various Iraqi paramilitary factions.
There are notable differences between the Houthis and those other groups, said Hamidreza Azizi, a researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. They are less dependent on Iran than groups like Hezbollah, he told DW.  
It is impossible to know exactly how much support the Houthis get from Iran or how much they respond to Iran's orders. It's doubtful that Iran played a role in these latest attacks on ships in the Red Sea, Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told DW.
Although shipping has been endangered, observers suggest that the Houthi attacks don't pose much military danger to Israel itself. Any rockets fired in that country's direction have been repelled or shot down.
Rather, the attacks are a kind of political message for domestic audiences, Farea al-Muslimi, a research fellow with the British think tank Chatham House's Middle East and North Africa program, told DW recently.
""This war is a golden opportunity for the Houthi group to demonstrate its pro-Palestine, anti-Israel and anti-American position to its local population,"" al-Muslimi said. But their actions are unlikely to open any substantial new front for Israel to fight on, he added.
It is a different story for maritime traffic, though. The US and other countries, including Germany, had previously issued warnings that a naval coalition might be established if the Houthis kept on shooting at ships and attempting to hijack them.
A naval alliance could obviously cause major damage to the Houthis' military abilities. At the same time, it could also lead to more solidarity between the Houthis under attack and residents of Houthi-controlled areas.

US President Joe Biden said in a statement on Wednesday that the 10 Americans were ""coming home.""
""These individuals have lost far too much precious time with their loved ones, and their families have suffered every day in their absence. I am grateful that their ordeal is finally over, and that these families are being made whole once more,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement. 
Separately, US officials said that Washington would free businessman Alex Saab, a Colombian businessman who was in a Miami jail awaiting trial on a charge of money laundering.
Venezuela is also releasing a group of opposition-linked political prisoners as part of the deal; initial reports varied on how many, but put the figure at roughly 20.
Saab has already returned to Venezuela, the Venezuelan government said. It described Saab as ""a victim"" of ""illegal detention"" and characterized his release as a ""symbol of victory"" achieved through the country's ""peaceful diplomacy."" 
The swap deal will also result in the extradition of a fugitive defense contractor Leonard Glenn Francis who is at the center of a massive Pentagon bribery scandal. 
Nicknamed ""Fat Leonard,"" Francis fled home custody in San Diego in September 2022 and was arrested by Venezuelan police attempting to board a flight at the Simon Bolivar International Airport outside Caracas.
The deal represents the boldest attempt by the US government to improve relations with Venezuela. The largest release of American prisoners in Venezuelan history comes weeks after the Biden administration agreed to suspend some sanctions after Maduro and an opposition group pledged to work toward free and fair conditions for the 2024 presidential election.

https://www.dw.com/en/cease-fire-in-gaza-why-germany-abstained-in-un-votes/a-67772509,CONFLICTS,Cease-fire in Gaza: Why Germany abstained in UN votes 20.12.2023,"Germany's decision to abstain in the October 27 vote at the United Nations General Assembly angered Israel's ambassador in Berlin. Three weeks earlier, Hamas terrorists had brutally attacked Israel, killing hundreds of Israeli soldiers and civilians, and taking many more hostage.
After Israel responded by launching a massive attack on the Gaza Strip, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution calling for a cease-fire to help the people of Gaza. However, the text of the resolution did not address the crimes committed by Hamas. 14 UN member states voted against, including the United States, Israel itself, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Austria. Germany was one of 45 states that abstained.
""We need Germany's support at the UN,"" Israel's ambassador to Berlin, Ron Prosor, said afterwards. It wasn't enough, he declared, to abstain ""because people are incapable of saying explicitly that Hamas is responsible for this brutal massacre.""
That was the reason for the abstention: Germany was not prepared to vote in favor of the resolution because it neither mentioned nor condemned the Hamas terror attacks. But it didn't want to vote against the resolution, either, because that would have shown too little consideration for the suffering of the people of Gaza. Furthermore, Germany will always advocate for a cease-fire in any conflict, on principle.
Germany had worked intensively with Canada to try to improve the text before the vote, adding condemnation of the Hamas attacks and hostage-taking, and calling for the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages. However, this failed to gain the backing of a majority of countries.
And the same scenario played out again. On Tuesday, December 12, Germany again abstained at the UN General Assembly in New York. Again, member states were asked to vote on a text that called for a cease-fire, and again Germany voted neither yes nor no.
Its voting behavior was decided on in a close consultation between the Chancellery and the Foreign Office, and many politicians in the Bundestag, from different parties, expressed their approval.
""We all want an end to the violence. And Germany is strongly advocating an end to the violence,"" Max Lucks, a Green Party politician, told DW. ""Germany is calling on all parties to comply with their obligations under international law. But Germany had to abstain, because the resolution does not mention who is the aggressor in this situation, and who is the victim.""
Germany's voting behavior also takes into account its particular circumstances. For Germany, after the crimes committed during the Nazi era, its relationship with Israel is ""a matter of state"" (""Staatsräson""), meaning its solidarity with Israel is unshakeable. On the other hand, around 5.5 million Muslims live in Germany, and their empathy lies primarily with the people of the Gaza Strip.
So what has changed in the time between the two abstentions? International criticism of Israel is growing. The massive attacks on the Gaza Strip have now even prompted US President Joe Biden, a staunch defender of Israel, to intervene.
Biden told his Democratic Party supporters that initially, in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks, there was worldwide solidarity with Israel. But Biden said the government in Jerusalem now risks losing this support through ""indiscriminate bombing.""

Asked on December 14 if he wanted Israel to scale down its operations by the end of December, Biden said: ""I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives — not stop going after Hamas, but be more careful.""
But for many politicians in the German Bundestag, solidarity with Israel is still absolute.
""Israel has the right to defend itself, and the right to destroy Hamas, which represents the greatest threat in Israel's history,"" Jürgen Hardt, the CDU's foreign policy spokesman in the Bundestag, told DW. ""And a cease-fire that is not explicitly limited to a certain period of time, hours or days, will only help Hamas recover.""
SPD representative Ralf Stegner had an even more fundamental explanation for why Germany had been unable to vote in favor this time as well.
""For Germany, disregarding Israel's security is absolutely unthinkable,"" he said. ""The state of Israel was founded as a consequence of the Holocaust. That is our historical responsibility — and the political reason for acting this way.""
""We welcome the UN General Assembly's demand that the hostages be freed,"" said Jürgen Trittin, long-time foreign policy expert for the Greens. ""What is still lacking, though, is a clear acknowledgement that Hamas is not a liberation movement but a terrorist organization — an anti-Palestinian terrorist organization.""
That's not a slip of the tongue: Trittin deliberately called Hamas an anti-Palestinian organization, because in the long term its actions also undermine Palestinians' hopes for a state of their own.
The day after the second abstention, a spokesperson for German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock (Greens) in Berlin reiterated the rationale behind Germany's voting behavior in the UN General Assembly.
""It does not make sense to us to demand a cease-fire when we must assume that one side will continue to launch its rocket attacks from Gaza,"" the spokesperson said.
However, this time, unlike at the end of October, Baerbock explicitly stated that ""the suffering of civilians in Gaza is unbearable.""
This, then, has changed between the two abstentions. Criticism of Israel is growing — also in Germany. But Berlin will not agree to a cease-fire that fails to mention the terrorist actions of Hamas.

https://www.dw.com/en/afghanistan-calls-for-ending-talibans-gender-apartheid/a-67784233,EQUALITY,Afghanistan: Calls for ending Taliban's 'gender apartheid' 20.12.2023,"Since the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021, Pakistani Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai has been actively campaigning for women's rights in the war-devastated country.
""The Taliban's edicts are systematically erasing millions of women and girls in Afghanistan from public life, and we all must do more to hold the Taliban to account,"" Yousafzai told DW. ""First and foremost, I am calling on all governments to make gender apartheid a crime against humanity.""
On Wednesday, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) discussed the increasingly dire situation in Afghanistan.
At the start of December, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), established by the UNSC in 2002 to support Afghan institutions in areas such as human rights, the rule of law and equality, published its latest report. 
In it, UNAMA refers to the Taliban administration as ""de facto authorities"" as it lacks international recognition.
""The de facto authorities continue to restrict the rights of women and girls.""

Since the Taliban takeover, women and girls have been increasingly confined to their homes. They are barred from education beyond sixth grade, including university, public spaces like parks, and most jobs. They must take a male chaperone with them on journeys of more than 72 kilometers (45 miles) and follow a dress code.
The UNAMA report states that in some provinces, like Khost and Sabul, women and girls are prohibited from even visiting local markets or stores without a male companion.
A Taliban decree in July also ordered the closure of all women-run beauty salons, one of the few remaining places that women could go to outside the home or family environment.
The international community has been aware of the situation for a long time, Niloufar Nikseyar, a former lecturer at Herat University, told DW.
""At every opportunity, a new report has been published about the situation of women and girls in Afghanistan. Each time, we have hoped that the world will hear our voice and that the situation will change for the better,"" she said.
""But we haven't seen any improvements in the past two years. Still, as a woman, I always strive to be the voice of the victims in Afghanistan. We don't want to give up hope.""
Nikseyar, who still lives in Afghanistan, belongs to a group of women who organize reading sessions at home for women and girls. Even for these all-female gatherings, they have to inform the Taliban and seek permission.

When they seized power, the Taliban initially promised to respect women's rights under Islamic law, or Shariah. However, the Islamic fundamentalist group has gradually introduced a slew of restrictions and policies denying women and girls even their basic rights — solely because of their gender.
Sahraa Karimi, an Afghan film director, described Taliban policies as ""gender apartheid"" and stressed that they are ""a crime against humanity.""
Fearing for her life, Karimi fled Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover. She now lives in the United States.
""In the past two years, reports from Afghanistan and the restrictions on women and girls have shown that the Taliban have not changed their attitude at all,"" she said.
""Unfortunately, the international community is supporting the Taliban by remaining silent. This allows them to continue suppressing women's basic rights.""
Karimi is worried about the future of Afghanistan. She fears that Afghan society will become even more regressive under Taliban rule and serve as a base for radical forces, which ultimately pose a serious threat to the entire world. 
It is time for the international community to actively work to abolish gender segregation in Afghanistan and ensure that the Taliban are held accountable for their actions, she underlined.

""Western countries, as well as regional powers, can change this situation, but I don't see any political will to do so,"" said Shaharzad Akbar, a rights advocate who was head of Afghanistan's Human Rights Commission from 2019 to 2021.
Akbar, now living in the United Kingdom, received an award from Germany's Friedrich Ebert Foundation in November for her efforts promoting human rights. 
""Afghanistan must not be forgotten,"" she told DW on the sidelines of the award ceremony. ""It is our duty to be the voice of women in Afghanistan. Human rights activists and the media must not allow the Taliban's lies to become the truth about Afghanistan.""
Malala Yousafzai stressed the need to ""send a clear signal to Afghan women and girls that we see them, we hear their call to action, and we stand ready to offer our solidarity. We also need to help girls continue their studies while the ban on school remains in place.""
""Philanthropists and investors can scale up their funding to the Afghan and international organizations who have been providing creative, alternative and digital learning programs to reach Afghan girls in their homes.""

https://www.dw.com/en/how-trump-can-run-for-us-president-despite-legal-troubles/a-67728170,POLITICS,How Trump can run for US president despite legal troubles 20.12.2023,"COVID cases are on the rise, Taylor Swift released the best-selling album of the year and the fight between Joe Biden and Donald Trump is heating up. Sounds like 2020? That's right. But it's also where we are right now.
Though the Republicans haven't yet formally decided who their candidate will be in the 2024 US presidential elections, it's looking more and more likely that it will be former President Trump again. Nowhere does it say that the two terms each president is allowed must be consecutive.
Trump's campaign suffered a setback on Monday, December 19, 2023, when the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that he wasn't eligible to run for president in the state on the grounds that he had committed insurrection with his involvement in the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The judges pointed to the 14th amendment to the Constitution, which bans people who have sworn to protect the US Constitution and then engaged in insurrection from holding federal office again. 
But the amendment is from the time of the Civil War, and it does not clearly refer to presidents. Trump's campaign has already announced they'll appeal, bringing the case to the US Supreme Court where conservative justices, three of whom were appointed by Trump himself, hold a 6-3 majority. Unless the case is resolved quickly, with the Supreme Court siding with the Colorado judges by a deadline in early January, Trump's name will still appear on the state's Republican primary ballot.  
In nationwide polls Trump has been ahead of fellow Republican candidates like Florida governor Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina governor and UN ambassador Nikki Haley, usually by a wide margin.

Donald Trump is the only US president to be impeached twice. In both cases, the House of Representatives charged Trump with articles of impeachment (in 2019 it was abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, in 2021 it was incitement of insurrection), but the Senate acquitted him.
Only if the Senate, the higher chamber of Congress, convicts a president is he or she removed from office, a step that comes with the ""disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States"" again, as stipulated in the Constitution.   
So the double-impeachment is no legal hindrance. But what about Trump's other troubles with the law?
The trials about to start against Trump in 2024 include civil fraud trials related to how Trump and his sons ran the family business, and a sexual assault and defamation trial. In the latter case, a jury had already found Trump liable for defaming a former columnist, with the judge concluding that Trump raped the woman and then denied it. The upcoming trial is supposed to determine how much Trump will have to pay the writer for defaming her.
There are also several cases against the former president related to his behavior after losing the 2020 election: A federal criminal trial in Miami in which Trump is charged with keeping classified government documents at his Mar-a-Lago home when he was no longer president, a racketeering trial in Georgia that has Trump and 18 other defendants charged with interfering with 2020 election results, and a US Department of Justice case in which Trump is charged with felonies in connection with his attempt to remain in power after losing in 2020.

No matter the outcome of these trials, though, Trump would not lose the eligibility to run for president. The US Constitution has no limits regarding criminal convictions for presidential hopefuls.
""There are several arguments over whether a presidential candidate who is indicted or is involved in an on-going legal case should still run for office,"" Laura Merrifield Wilson, associate professor of political science at the University of Indianapolis, told DW. ""But those are based on morals, judgement, and preferences, not overt laws or procedural barriers."" 
If convicted of a felony in the Mar-a-Lago case, Trump would not be allowed to vote (in Florida, felons lose that right), but he could still run for the highest office in the country. Even if he were sent to prison, it would not interfere with his candidacy. What would happen if Trump won the presidential election while in prison, however, is unclear.
""We’re so far removed from anything that’s ever happened,"" Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley, told the New York Times. ""It’s just guessing.""
Legally, the trials don't hurt Trump's presidential aspirations. But what about his appeal to voters?
Independents ""may be turned off by a very salient conviction of Trump,"" Christopher Federico, professor of political science and political psychology at the University of Minnesota, told DW. But ""I don't think any convictions are going to hurt him with his true base within the Republican party.""
Federico's colleague and fellow political psychologist Howard Lavine also says the criminal charges haven't hurt Trump with his supporters ― on the contrary.
""Each indictment seemed to bolster Trump's potential vote-share,"" Lavine told DW. ""He's framed this [to his voters] as 'They're trying to exact retribution against me as a proxy for exacting retribution against you.'""

Both Federico and Lavine say that Trump has intuitively been very successful at connecting with his voter base ― whites without a college degree and conservative Black and Latino men. He makes them feel that he's an outsider just like them and thus understands their anger and fear at being left behind by the elites in Washington.
Social reforms on gender issues and increased efforts for more equality and inclusion have fanned the flames of that fear, Lavine says.
""Being heterosexual isn't any better than not being heterosexual, being a man doesn't give you quite the status it once did, whites are decreasing as a proportion of the American population, and we will soon be a country in which Christians will be the minority,"" Lavine said. ""This is threatening the majority status of white Christian men. A lot of people feel like their social prestige is being decreased. And it appears Trump is able to laser-focus on these fears.""
His core supporter base, the experts say, want to feel represented and seen, and believe that Trump will fight to bring them back to their former glory ― to ""make America great again."" Potential criminal convictions don't matter for that.
""I don't think Trump supporters would turn their back on him, period,"" Wilson said. ""They remain steadfast and loyal, even if not to the man, certainly to the mythological representation of what he stands for.""

https://www.dw.com/en/gaza-conflict-how-arab-attitudes-are-hardening-against-israel/a-67769920,CONFLICTS,Gaza conflict: How Arab attitudes are hardening against Israel 20.12.2023,"The young movie director in Jordan made his disillusionment clear.
""I no longer want to speak their language, watch their films, or even follow their celebrities,"" Omar Rammal, 26, wrote in a recent Instagram post.
""They are all the same to me,"" the award-winning director, with almost 800,000 followers, expressed his feelings about the so-called Western world. ""Their hearts are like stones. They see us as less than human.""
Rammal is of Palestinian descent, so he is perhaps closer to the current conflict in Gaza than many in the Middle East. But he is far from alone in these kinds of opinions.
Since the militant-Islamist Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, the Israel Defense Forces have been bombing the Gaza Strip. Hamas is classified as a terrorist organization by Germany, the European Union, the United States and others. Israel has also launched a ground offensive into the Gaza Strip and fighting is ongoing.
The nonstop stream of pictures coming out of Gaza over the past two months has horrified many. And the mounting death toll seems to be rapidly changing attitudes in the Middle East, a survey by the US-based research organization Arab Barometer has found.
On October 7, the research organization was halfway through one of its regular opinion surveys in Tunisia. It continued the other half of the study as Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip intensified. The researchers found that ""in just 20 days, Tunisians' views on the world shifted in ways that rarely happen, even over the course of a few years.""
They shared a number of conclusions in an article published in Foreign Affairs magazine last week. Israel was even less popular than it had been with Tunisians previously, as were any nations that supported Israel. That included the United States but also Saudi Arabia, which had been moving towards normalization with Israel.
That study only applies to Tunisia, but comments from senior politicians around the Middle East appear to confirm that the opinions are widespread. 
In mid-November, while meeting with EU officials, Jordan's King Abdullah II said that the Gaza conflict was going to fuel radicalization in the region for decades. A few days earlier, an Arab foreign minister told a BBC journalist he was worried what the conflict was doing to young people in his country. ""They watch what is happening in Gaza on TV and they are increasingly angry,"" he said.
""We know from all our research that justice, and perception of justice, is a key driver in radicalization,"" the head of a peace-building organization in Jordan told Newlines magazine this week.
Egyptian journalist Hossam el-Hamalawy said he believes there are similar feelings in his homeland. There had already been some criticism of Germany for exporting arms to Egypt's authoritarian government, el-Hamalawy, who is also a researcher and activist who writes a regular newsletter on Egyptian politics, told DW.
""But Germany's unconditional support for the ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza has made Egyptians even angrier,"" he said. ""People in Egypt and the Arab world were also shocked to see police in Berlin apparently racially profiling Arabs in the streets and crushing demonstrations — as though it was a non-Western dictatorship.""
Could the apparent hardening of attitudes have a longer-term impact?
Opinion polls regularly showed that the Palestinian issue had huge resonance in the Middle East even before the current conflict began. More recent polling has suggested Arab citizens were always considerably less enthusiastic about normalizing relations with Israel than their leaders.
""No regime, be it non-democratic or otherwise, is completely insulated from public accountability,"" Salma al-Shami, research director at the Arab Barometer project, told DW. ""While public opinion might not have as much sway in non-democracies, it nonetheless makes it much more costly or difficult for regimes to outright go against it.""
This means that in the future, the issue of Palestinian statehood is less likely to be sidelined. 
The Arab Barometer research also found that Tunisians had developed a more positive opinion of the Iranian leadership, which supports Hamas.
In recent years, respondents to the Arab Barometer's surveys have been more likely to renounce the use of violence to further political causes.
But, according to the organization's most recent research, this seems to have changed in Tunisia. Before October 7, two-thirds of Tunisians favored a two-state solution to the Palestinian issue. Only 6% chose the ""other"" category, within which most supported armed resistance. However, since October 7, the latter category has risen to 36%. 
While Tunisians are too far away from the conflict to do much about that, if attitudes are changing the same way in countries closer to Israel, it could become problematic, researchers said. 
Whether those changes in attitude lead to violent extremism or terrorist acts in Europe or the United States remains unclear.
Earlier this month, European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson said societal polarization was increasing the risk of violence in Europe. 
The Gaza conflict has caused emotional divisions in Europe and the US, as well as a rise in racist, antisemitic and Islamophobic acts and speech.
If its history is anything to go by, Hamas is unlikely to commit terrorist acts in Europe. According to the Jewish Virtual Library, the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence and others, Hamas has not committed any terrorist acts outside of Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. Recently, there were some arrests in Germany and the Netherlands of people thought to be linked to Hamas and suspected ""of planning attacks"" in Europe. Such an attack, if it went ahead, would likely have been the first time as Hamas' concerns have been primarily regionally limited — unlike extremist groups such as al-Qaida or the ""Islamic State,"" which have international aims.
In the past, the ""Islamic State"" group has used what it calls ""Western double standards"" to recruit new members.
Groups with a  more global outlook, like al-Qaida and the ""Islamic State"", already call on individuals to carry out attacks against Jews in the short term, said Tanya Mehra, a senior research fellow at the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism in The Hague.
""The longer the conflict continues, they could indeed recruit more members,"" she told DW.  
In fact, all kinds of groups are trying to exploit the conflict for their own ends, Mehra added: From far-right groups that use it to fuel anti-immigration sentiment and antisemitism to the alleged involvement of Russia in the painting of Stars of David on Parisian walls in November, as well as other nations far from the actual conflict.
""We're also seeing the conflict lead to increased radicalization and violent extremism in south and southeast Asia,"" Mehra noted.
 Observers have said far-right groups in India are using the conflict to demonize Muslims there.
While increased radicalization is a concern, the Arab Barometer's al-Shami said it detracts from the issue of human rights for Palestinians.
""Palestine doesn't just matter because of security concerns,"" she said. ""Palestine matters because human rights matter and justice matters and self-determination matters. In their attitudes and their actions, Arab publics — be it in their domestic struggles or their regional ones — have constantly affirmed that these professed core values deserve more than lip service.""

https://www.dw.com/en/how-a-turkish-industrial-firm-expands-to-bosnian-propaganda/a-67769270,POLITICS,How a Turkish industrial firm expands to Bosnian propaganda 20.12.2023,"The ""gang of five"" is the name critics gave the top five companies that have consistently been awarded the biggest infrastructure projects by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government in Turkey. Among them Mehmet Cengiz, the CEO of Cengiz Holding.
From building Turkey's first nuclear power plant to allegations of importing record amounts of sanctioned goods, Cengiz Holding has been involved in a myriad of business operations. Between 2002 and 2020, the company secured $42.1 billion (€38.3 billion) in contracts.
DW Turkish, together with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), also revealed in the Pandora Papers and Panama Papers that Mehmet Cengiz used tax havens to invest some of his wealth.
Cengiz Holding hit the headlines several times over the past decade, primarily because of controversies over public tenders awarded directly to the company but also due to threats to media professionals and the environmental impact of their projects.
Public documents obtained by DW show Cengiz Holding decided to write the headlines itself — and chose to do it in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Eti Bakir is among the dozens of companies managed by the holding company. Eti Bakir, in turn, funded Simurg Media in Bosnia and Herzegovina with approximately €29,000 in 2015. Simurg Media manages two media outlets: Faktor, a daily online news website, and STAV, a weekly political magazine.
Borka Rudic, secretary general of the Association of Journalists of Bosnia and Herzegovina, told DW that Simurg Media's publications are aimed at the Bosniak ethnic group, which makes up half of the country's population.
""We are a small market, as a country, and Simurg Media has only focused on one part of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina,"" Rudic said. ""It has no chance to make a profit or to be a sustainable media company.""
According to Rudic, the apparent lack of potential profit indicated Cengiz Holding's media investment is ""politically motivated.""
Turkish journalist and academic Can Ertuna said it has become common practice for businesses to enter the media landscape without ""the sole purpose of making money from journalism or publishing.""
Ertuna said international companies, such as Cengiz Holding, ""do not enter the media for profit, but for the survival of their business relations,"" and added that ""when there are no legal obstacles, they aim to create a sphere of influence for themselves.""
Cengiz Holding has repeatedly won record-breaking contracts in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 2012. The total value of two highway projects it undertook in 2012 alone was $383 million. Between 2018 and 2020, the tenders rewarded to the company amounted to over €275 million. In March 2023, Cengiz Holding won another record-breaking tender valued at €420 million.
According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK), the trade volume between Turkey and Bosnia and Herzegovina amounted to €900 million in 2022. In the country with an annual gross domestic product of €24 billion, the total value of the tenders won by Cengiz Holding in the last 11 years exceeds €1 billion. 
Much of the financing for these projects was provided by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank.
According to Ertuna, the conditions for companies doing business abroad cannot be considered completely independent of foreign policy — especially between countries with good relations. ""It is obvious that companies that receive some form of public support have an advantage over others,"" he said.
STAV follows ""the political agenda of the SDA party (Party for Democratic Action) and reporting favourably on its members, and the Turkish President Erdogan,"" according to a 2020 report by SEENPM, a network of media centers and institutes in central and south eastern Europe.
The report, published with the support of the European Union, added that ""any kind of criticism against the party has been portrayed as attacks against the Bosniaks and the state.""
Given their existing network of relations in Turkey, Ertuna called it unsurprising that companies like Cengiz Holding ""invest in media for the benefit of the government that supports their investments abroad and for the survival of their own business relations in that country.""
Sociologist Dirim Özkan, who has lived in Sarajevo for years, said the SDA party, founded in 1990 by Bosnian politician Aliya Izetbegovic, comes from an Islamist tradition and is supported by Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) government. 
""The SDA is a party that can be considered neo-Ottomanist,"" Özkan said, emphasizing the ideological aspect of Erdogan's support for the party.
""Serbia is the big brother of Bosnian Serbs. Croatia is the big brother of Croats. Bosniaks and Muslims have no one to lean on. Turkey is positioned as their protective brother,"" he said.
The Turkish move to support Bosnia's SDA, according to Özkan, comes despite low levels of international trade between the countries.
European statistical agency Eurostat data showed that 5.9% of Bosnia and Herzegovina's imports in 2022 came from Turkey, and 1.7% of the country's total exports went to Turkey.
""Even if the discourse maintains a resolute tone, it holds symbolic significance for conservative voters in both nations, "" Özkan said.
The SDA is currently led by the founder Aliya Izetbegovic's son Bakir Izetbegovic, who served two terms as the Bosniak member of the Bosnia and Herzegovina presidency between 2010 and 2018. Erdogan, whom Izetbegovic called ""my brother and friend,"" was the official witness at Izetbegovic's daughter's wedding in 2021 — making the political closeness between the two leaders clear.
""The fact that Izetbegovic and President Erdogan had emotional moments on TV, their brotherhood is affecting Muslim voters in Bosnia,"" Özkan said.
After losing a presidential election in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Fahrudin Radoncic, a media magnate and one of Bakir Izetbegovic's most important political rivals, commented, ""I fought not only against Izetbegovic but also against Recep Tayyip Erdogan in this election.""
Selma Zulic Siljak, a project coordinator and researcher at the Mediacentar Sarajevo, said the friendship between Izetbegovic and Erdogan is often portrayed in the media, especially during elections.
""We observe that hate-oriented discourse increases especially during election periods,"" said Siljak, adding that her organization ""red flagged"" the daily online news website, Faktor, for ""publishing disinformation.""
Both STAV and Faktor were among the media listed for providing biased reporting by a Mediacentar Sarajevo report titled ""Harmful discourse during the elections"" that analyzed media reporting during Bosnia and Herzegovina's 2022 general election.
The two organizations mainly targeted opposition parties and former SDA members, the report added. 
Experts assert that advertisements are not enough to sustain STAV's large editorial staff and question the source of the rest of the organization's funding. 
Journalist and academic Ertuna called it ethically problematic for media organizations toserve the public interest by keeping tabs on all branches of government when they are funded by conglomerates that receive public tenders. 
""In fact, for media companies to have business relations with the institutions that they are supposed to examine on behalf of society raises serious questions about the extent to which such a task can be fulfilled,"" Ertuna said.
Mehmet Cengiz and Utku Gök, Cengiz Holding's Bosnia and Herzegovina manager, did not respond to DW's request for comment.

https://www.dw.com/en/samuel-l-jackson-a-movie-icon-at-75/a-67730846,FILM,Samuel L. Jackson: A movie icon at 75 20.12.2023,"He's one of the most iconic figures in Hollywood: Samuel L. Jackson. From ""Pulp Fiction"" to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Jackson has left an indelible mark on cinema, with his commanding presence and unmistakable voice, as well as his versatility as an actor.
Born in Washington, D.C., on December 21, 1948, Samuel Leroy Jackson was an only child raised by his mother and grandparents in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He attended the historically Black Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, first studying Marine Biology, then switching to Architecture and finally Drama.
It was at Morehouse that he also became involved in the civil rights movement. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine this year, he said that involvement led to the FBI visiting his mother in 1969 and telling her ""something bad was going to happen to [him]"" if he did not leave Atlanta. So she put her son on a plane to Los Angeles.
He had small roles in independent and television films, then moved to New York in 1976, where he worked in theater. Jackson had his first professional stage role in a production of Bertolt Brecht's play ""Mother Courage and her Children.""
But it was his collaboration with director Spike Lee (a fellow Morehouse alumnus) that really launched his career.
In 1989, Jackson starred in Lee's ""Do the Right Thing,"" a film that showcased his acting skills and paved the way for future collaborations between the two. So far, Jackson has appeared in six of Lee's films, including ""Mo' Better Blues"" (1990), ""Jungle Fever"" (1991) and ""Chi-Raq"" (2015).
Another influential director for Jackson's career is Quentin Tarantino, who cast him as the Bible-quoting hitman Jules Winnfield in his hugely successful 1994 film ""Pulp Fiction."" Jackson's gripping performance, coupled with his delivery of Tarantino's now-famous Ezekiel 25:17 monologue, made him an international star and earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. 
Their collaboration has continued with films like ""Jackie Brown"" (1997) and ""Django Unchained"" (2012). Tarantino's sharp and carefully crafted dialogue finds a perfect expression in Jackson's delivery, creating moments that linger in the audience's memory long after the credits roll.
From the menacing villain in ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" (1995) to the wise and powerful Jedi Master Mace Windu in the ""Star Wars"" prequel trilogy, or more comic turns like the superhero Frozone in the ""Incredibles"" animated films, Jackson's acting range is impressive. He transitions smoothly among genres, pouring authenticity and charisma into every role. 
His portrayal of Nick Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, starting with a post-credits scene in ""Iron Man"" (2008), has made him a symbol of authority and leadership for an entire generation of moviegoers. The character's inclusion in various Marvel films and television series solidifies Jackson's place in the pantheon of pop culture icons. 
But Jackson's influence extends beyond acting. He's long been an advocate for diversity in the film industry, using his platform to address the lack of representation both in front of and behind the camera.
Jackson is also known for his philanthropy and commitment to social justice. He supports various charities and causes, including organizations focused on education and health. His involvement with One for the Boys, a charity dedicated to raising awareness about male cancers, showcases his commitment to making a positive impact on the world beyond the realm of entertainment.
Despite his larger-than-life persona on screen, Jackson is known for his down-to-earth demeanor off-screen. He is candid in interviews, and unafraid to speak his mind on issues ranging from politics to race relations. He's also been open about his past struggles with substance abuse, and he's described his passion for golf (Jackson's contracts stipulate he get two days off per week off to play) as replacing a previous addiction.
His voice is instantly recognizable, making him a sought-after narrator for documentaries, commercials, and even GPS navigation systems. His famous catchphrases, delivered with trademark gusto, have become ingrained in the cultural lexicon, further solidifying his status as a pop culture icon.
As Samuel L. Jackson reaches the milestone age of 75, he's already established himself as one of the highest-grossing actors of all time. Whether he's wielding a lightsaber, reciting iconic monologues, or advocating for social change, Jackson has created an enduring legacy in the world of entertainment.

https://www.dw.com/en/suriname-court-upholds-ex-presidents-20-year-sentence/a-67781880,LAW AND JUSTICE,Suriname court upholds ex-president's 20-year sentence 20.12.2023,"A three-judge panel in Suriname on Wednesday upheld the 2019 conviction of former president Desi Bouterse for his role in the execution of 15 political opponents in December 1982. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
""Those who sought justice had angelic patience,"" court president Dinesh Sewratan said as he read the judgment. After the appeal decision, the ex-president's only remaining option is to ask for a pardon.
The 78-year-old Bouterse led the country through the 1980s as head of a military government, then returned to office in 2010 and was re-elected five years later.
Bouterse seized power in a 1980 coup against Suriname's first prime minister, Henck Arron, just five years after the South American country, wedged between Guyana and French Guyana, gained independence from the Netherlands.
The court ruled in 2019 that Bouterse oversaw a December 1982 operation in which soldiers abducted 16 leading government critics — including lawyers, journalists, union leaders, soldiers and university professors — from their homes.
Fifteen were murdered in a colonial fortress in the capital, Paramaribo. One union leader survived and testified against Bouterse.
However, Bouterse has denied involvement in the 1982 killings, saying the victims were held for plotting a counter-coup with the help of the CIA and were shot while trying to escape.
The ruling comes at a time when tensions are already high in the small country, which has seen protests against soaring inflation and austerity measures.
Bouterse remains very popular, especially among the country's poor and working class. In July, he said he would respect the verdict.
""Whatever it will be, I'm ready for it,"" he said, adding he was ""convinced that the other judge, history, will acquit me 100%.""
On the eve of the verdict, the Dutch and French embassies in the capital, Paramaribo, warned of possible unrest.
Police announced roadblocks that would make it difficult for Bouterse's supporters to approach the courthouse.
In 1999, a court in the Netherlands, Suriname's former colonial ruler, sentenced Bouterse in absentia to 11 years in prison for cocaine smuggling, another charge he denies.

https://www.dw.com/en/jews-in-germany-the-aftermath-of-the-hamas-terror-attacks/a-67771189,SOCIETY,Jews in Germany: The aftermath of the Hamas terror attacks 20.12.2023,"Yes, says Doron Rubin, he still takes the subway in Berlin — or rather, he's using it again. The 41-year-old father-of-three avoided doing so in the days immediately after October 7.
Since that day, when the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and abducted around 240 more, he says everything has changed in his daily life and his attitude toward it.
""Insecurity and uncertainty are now our constant companions. There are no periods of calm.""  
Rubin is Jewish. Born in Germany, he is a member of the Jewish congregation Kahal Adass Jisroel (KAJ), based in Berlin's Brunnenstrasse. The KAJ received unwelcome national attention in October when, despite the police guards outside, unknown assailants threw incendiary devices at its synagogue and community center.

Traditionally, some Jewish men wear a flat, round head covering called a yarmulke, or kippah, a symbol of their reverence for God. Many Jews also affix a mezuzah, a parchment scroll with handwritten texts in a case, to their doorposts.
Rubin told DW that in the past few weeks, many members of the community had found stars of David sprayed on the walls of their houses, and some had consequently moved the mezuzah to inside the door. ""Everything is different,"" he said.
Pasha Lubarsky, a 44-year-old mechanical engineer and the honorary chair of the KAJ community, agreed. To begin with, he said, people were in shock. He said people often asked themselves whether Germany was right for them in such situations. ""But we won't be intimidated. Even if we're scared, we still have to take action.""
In the weeks since October 7, there has been tight security in Germany around protests against Israel's ongoing military offensive in Gaza. Launched in response to the Hamas terror attacks, the bombardment and fighting has now killed almost 20,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.
The venue for Germany's Jewish Community Day (Gemeindetag), a hotel in the west of Berlin, was also heavily protected. Police were visible everywhere, even in the corridors and walkways. Rubin and Lubarsky were among around 1,400 Jews from all over Germany who gathered at the four-day congress for discussions, training, exchange, and celebration.
Just hours before it began, on December 14, security services announced the arrest of suspected Hamas supporters in Berlin and Rotterdam, who are believed to have been planning attacks on Jewish institutions in Europe. The European Union and its member states, as well as numerous other countries, have long regarded Hamas as a terrorist organization, but Germany only banned pro-Hamas activity at the beginning of November.
At the Community Day gathering, Josef Schuster, the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, spoke repeatedly of the anti-Israel and antisemitic demonstrations in German cities, which involved many young migrants. There was hatred of Jews before October 7, said Schuster, ""but the quality and the threat are different now.""
The phrase ""everything is different"" recurs again and again. Dozens of Jewish parents reported that their children had experienced antisemitic incidents. All the rabbis there could confirm the observation of Jasmin Andriani from the liberal Jewish community in Göttingen: many community members now prefer to participate in religious services online instead of going to synagogue.
""October 7 is a major watershed in every respect — for our educational work, as well,"" says Doron Kiesel. As the director of the Central Council's education department, Kiesel is also responsible for establishing the Jewish Academy in Frankfurt am Main.
He has spent many years trying to combat antisemitism through teaching and raising awareness of the issue, only to find that his work has not been understood. It is hard, he says, ""to be confronted with the ruins of your own work.""
Politicians invited to the Community Day usually present prepared speeches. Both sides praise each other and commend their respective work, and everyone is happy. In 2023, however, things weren't quite as straightforward. This was apparent right from the start when German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier opened the proceedings. There was little applause for him as he entered the room.
""We are all profoundly affected by the terrible events in Israel,"" Steinmeier said. He spoke of Israel as a state ""that is defending itself and must defend itself."" A few days earlier, on a visit there, Steinmeier had visited a kibbutz near the Gaza Strip that was destroyed in the Hamas attack. However, when he mentioned the ""dreadful destruction in Gaza"" and the ""many thousands dead"" at the Community Day, there was silence in the hall.
The attendees made their feelings even clearer during the speech by the German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. She spoke of attending a Hanukkah celebration in Dubai and commented that there, too, Jews were afraid. However, when she went on to say that Israel's security was Germany's reason of state, there were several interruptions from the audience, expressing criticism and outrage that Germany had abstained from votes on UN resolutions about Israel's war against Hamas.
Baerbock tried to explain and stressed the necessity of dialog: ""Israel will only be able to live in safety when Palestinians can eventually live free of terrorism. Equally, Palestinians will only be able to live in safety when Israel lives in safety."" The atmosphere in the room remained frosty.
With Baerbock, Central Council president Schuster criticized the government's course diplomatically. Before the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, made his appearance, Schuster spoke more plainly. He invoked the formula German politicians have used repeatedly since October 7. In the country of ""Never again is now,"" Schuster said in his address to Scholz, ""'Never again"" is sometimes, in fact, more like 'eventually.'""
Of course, people were allowed clearly to criticize Israel's government and the behavior of militant settlers there, Schuster stressed. He himself did so during the Community Day, as did other representatives. However, he said he felt there was a lack of unequivocal solidarity with Israelis concerning the war.
In the scripted part of his speech, Chancellor Scholz invoked Germany's ""open society"" and called for empathy and solidarity with Jews — but barely mentioned Israel. Toward the end, however, as if recalling Schuster's quiet anger, he spontaneously added five sentences, saying that ""of course"" Germany would always support Israel ""when Israel's right to defend itself is called into question in public debate. We will not allow that. Everyone can rely on Germany.""
Pasha Lubarsky agrees with Josef Schuster. If Germany is constantly invoking ""Never again,"" he says, it has to act accordingly. He thanked the Berlin police for their cooperation but remains concerned by the scale and extent of the demonstrations taking place on German streets.
Doron Rubin has also heard all the expressions of solidarity and invocations along the lines of ""Never again"" and is not convinced. ""Politics is trying to reinforce itself a bit,"" he said. ""Perhaps they're also trying to conceal a degree of powerlessness. What can be done to counter antisemitism on the street?""
Nonetheless, Rubin and Lubarsky say they will continue to wear the yarmulke in public, and they will keep attending synagogue in person.

https://www.dw.com/en/congo-why-are-elections-in-drc-so-important/a-67767599,POLITICS,Congo: Why are elections in DRC so important? 20.12.2023,"Millions of eligible voters turned up to cast their ballot in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on Wednesday, in an election seen as a test of incumbent President Felix Tshisekedi's commitment to steer the country toward much-needed peace and development. 
Tshisekedi's main challengers are Moise Katumbi, Martin Fayulu, and Nobel laureate Denis Mukwege. There is a lot at stake for Tshisekedi to fulfill his earlier promises if he wins a second term.
Like many Congolese, 27-year-old motorbike taxi driver Georges Bamue is disappointed with the current state of affairs in Congo.
Five years after graduating with a diploma in computer network maintenance, Bamue still navigates the streets of Congo's regional capital in the east, Goma, unable to find a job or raise funds to start a business using his qualification.
""I said to myself as soon as I graduated, now, at least, I can get off the bike because now, with these diplomas, if I can find something to do, they can hire me. And that was not the case,"" Bamue told the Reuters news agency.
With Congo's rampant inflation, the depreciation of the local currency and multiple demands on his meager income, Bamue said he struggles to make ends meet paying rent and making sure his family doesn't go hungry.    
Bamue, like millions of Congolese, has seen little improvement in living conditions despite Congo's vast critical minerals wealth — and promises made by Tshisekedi when he came to power in 2019.
""I am not happy because the country is not helping us young people. Especially young people who have studied. I sacrificed myself to go to college to study. But you end up like that, there's no work. The dream you had, everything is gone. So, it can't go on like this,"" said Bamue. 

Fighting between a myriad of rival armed groups over land and resources — not to mention brutal attacks on civilians — has intensified in eastern Congo in recent years, a legacy of regional wars that flared during the 1990s and 2000s. 
One such group, the M23 — a rebel group that DRC authorities accuse Rwanda's government of backing — has captured swaths of territory since launching a campaign in 2021. Voters in the areas of North Kivu province occupied by M23 fighters were not able to vote on Wednesday.
Other groups such as the ""Islamic State""-affiliated Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), and the Cooperative for the Development of the Congo (CODECO) group that claims to defend the interests of Lendu farmers, carry out regular assaults.
A statement released by the US Embassy in the capital, Kinshasa, ahead of the election said the eyes of the world will be focused on Congo this week as it marks another significant milestone in its history.
""At this important moment in Congolese history, it is incumbent on Congolese institutions to fulfill their constitutional mandates with the independence and integrity that the Congolese people expect,"" the statement said.
The United States also reaffirmed its readiness to use all available tools, including visa restrictions, to promote accountability for any individual involved in subverting elections or otherwise undermining the democratic process.
""Congo is an incredibly influential state. Insecurity in the country tends to spill over borders into the wider region and much of the world has an economic interest in the natural resources that Congo produces,"" Phil Clark from London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) told DW.
Congo is a test for the international community, according to Clark, who said that whether Wednesday's election goes smoothly and fairly is of enormous consequence far beyond Congo's borders.
The size of Western Europe, the Democratic Republic of Congo is the second-largest African country in terms of surface area, and the fourth most populous state on the continent, with an estimated 100 million inhabitants. 
Congo is awash with minerals and precious stones, from gold, diamonds and coltan to tin, copper and cobalt. Harboring the Congo River ­— the second-longest river in Africa after the Nile — Congo also has huge hydroelectric potential, as well as 80 million hectares (197 million acres) of arable land. 
""One of the reasons that the Congolese elections are so important globally is that Congo is one of the largest producers of the natural resources that are so central to the global economy,"" said Clark. ""That includes enormous lithium reserves that are central to the sustainable and environmental manufacturing plans that many countries have.""
""So continued instability and insecurity in eastern Congo undoubtedly will affect the ability of global companies to extract those resources to sell them safely on, on the international market. Many companies involved in those industries will be watching this election very closely,"" he added.
Countries like China, which have vast interests in Congo and exploit Congolese minerals, are often silent about what happens in the country.
""I think that's because the Chinese state and other powerful investors don't want to be seen as too entangled in the situation in eastern Congo,"" said Clark.
""They prefer to do their trade in the shadows and not to put a huge spotlight on their interests. They don't want to be seen to be meddling in the Congolese election in any shape or form,"" he added.
Tshisekedi's government has moved to renegotiate the terms of the 2008 infrastructure-for-minerals deal with Chinese investors, known as the ""deal of the century"" for its favorable conditions to China. 
Under the agreement, China promised to pay $6 billion (€5.4 billion) to build roads and other infrastructure in exchange for access to mineral rights worth $93 billion, according to the AFP news agency. Risk-averse companies that had previously avoided Congo's mining sector due to instability are taking a second look as new opportunities to tap into its minerals emerge.
Apart from China, European countries and the US also have economic interests in Congo. 
""The whole world is watching these elections very closely, even if many of these powerful investor countries are not stating their interests particularly explicitly,"" said Clark.

Congo has a history of turbulent politics. Two of its governments were overthrown violently in 1965 and then in 1997. In addition, two of the country's leaders have also been assassinated: Patrice Lumumba in 1961 and Laurent-Desire Kabila in 2001.
 Elections are often marked by violence. The vote that brought incumbent Tshisekedi to power in 2018 marked the first peaceful changeover in Congolese history, although the results were fiercely disputed. 
Decades of war, corruption and chronic mismanagement mean little of the country's enormous wealth trickles down to the population. About two-thirds of the Congolese population survive on under $2.15 a day, according to the World Bank.  
The cost of living has increased and the country relies heavily on imports of basic food stuffs. The depreciation of the Franc Congolais, or Congolese franc (CDF) has pushed up inflation, which surged to over 23% year-on-year in July 2023, according to the IMF.
Tshisekedi successfully negotiated a $1.5 billion program with the International Monetary Fund in July 2021, the first since the IMF broke ties with Kinshasa in 2012 under Tshisekedi's predecessor Joseph Kabila, Reuters reported in November.
More than 26 million people require humanitarian assistance, in part because of rampant insecurity, data from the United Nations' International Organization for Migration show.
Despite the shortfalls, Congo's economy grew by 8.5% in 2022 — one of the fastest rates of growth in sub-Saharan Africa — driven by stronger mining output, according to the IMF, Reuters reported.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-police-raid-pro-palestinian-feminist-group/a-67774918,POLITICS,German police raid pro-Palestinian feminist group 20.12.2023,"Police in Berlin, Germany's capital, conducted on Wednesday a raid targeting members of a pro-Palestinian, left-wing feminist group, German media reported.
The Zora group is accused of backing the radical, left-wing Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The European Union and the United States list the group as a terrorist organization.
The GDP police trade union representative for the Berlin area, Benjamin Jendro, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that around 200 officers took part in the operation. 
They searched six flats, an office and a cafe in the districts of Neukölln, Friedrichshain, Karlshorst, Wedding, Kreuzberg, Prenzlauer Berg and Wedding, the BZ newspaper reported.
There are six suspects, five of whom are said to belong to the group Zora.
German outlets reported that the raid was mainly prompted by a statement the group posted on its Instagram account on October 12. The statement was titled: ""No liberation of women without the liberation of Palestine.""
In the statement, the group argues that while the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which launched the October 7 terror attacks on Israel, has no interest in fighting the patriarchy, it is important to ""strengthen the progressive forces that are also part of the Palestinian resistance"" such as the PFLP.
The PFLP has historically been keen on organizing women and recruiting them in its activities.
The Zora group describes itself on its own website as an ""independent, anti-capitalist organization for young women.""
In a statement on December 15, the group criticized the ""repression"" it said the German state was exercising against both Palestinian solidarity and the fight against violence against women. It particularly noted increased searches against pro-Palestinian individuals since a ban on the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network.
""These are carried out on people who the state suspects of being close to the network, which in the reality of the racist authorities means that in this country you have to fear a search simply because you are Palestinian,"" the group said.
In early November, the German Interior Ministry banned both Samidoun and Hamas. The latter is designated as a terrorist organization in several countries, including Germany.

All times given are in GMT/UTC 
16:00: DW Africa's daily podcast AfricaLink. is live with the latest on the Congolese election. 
15:27: In a mid-poll update, the DRC's election commission (CENI) has acknowledged that some polling stations across the country opened late — up to seven hours late, the AP news agency reported — but CENI said that all polls would be open for the required duration of 11 hours, according to Reuters which cited CENI spokesperson Patricia Nseya.
Meanwhile, a provincial election commission official has told journalists that people displaced by violence in the east of the country had protested because they could not get back to their home towns to vote.
14:40: Polling stations ""have problems with machines, batteries,"" the archbishop of Kinshasa, Fridolin Ambongo, told reporters after casting his vote. ""Solutions need to be found quickly, otherwise the elections are going to go on for several days.""
14:10: Not all eligible voters will be able to cast their ballots in today's election. DW correspondent Ruth Alonga spoke to internally displaced people in the Kanyaruchinya camp near Goma in the east of the DRC, many of whom have fled from M23 rebels in the towns of Masisi and Rutshuru. They told DW that they cannot take part in the elections due to a lack of voter cards.
""I am here in Kanyaruchinya camp as an IDP, but I am registered on the voters' rolls in Rutshuru because that's where I'm from, so I was not allowed to vote here,"" one Conglese man told DW. ""It is the same for others of us from Masisi. It hurts our souls that we can't vote like the others. We feel discriminated against!""
""I didn't get a chance to register for the elections,"" a Congolese woman told DW, explaining that she had traveled to her parents in Kitshanga and by the time she returned to the camp, registrations had closed. ""I wish the government would help those who didn't get cards so that they can still vote, she added, ""because then we could elect politicians who would end the war and allow us to return home.""
11:47: Leading opposition candidates in DR Congo's presidential election have complained that voters faced ""chaos"" and ""irregularities"" as they tried to cast their ballots.
What did the opposition candidates say?
""We're waiting for all voters to cast their ballots, otherwise we won't accept these elections,"" Martin Fayulu has warned. 
""We have seen many irregularities since this morning in the polling stations,"" Moise Katumbi told reporters, asking voters to keep a watchful eye on the process until the end.
10:48: Presidential candidate Moise Katumbi has voted in his hometown of Lubumbashi. "" I would like to ask my supporters to remain at every polling station because we have to monitor the results till the end,"" Moise told reporters. Katumbi, a 58-year-old businessman and former governor of mineral-rich Katanga province, has been the main target of attacks from incumbent president Felix Tshisekedi. 
10:14: ""Voting is a duty that every Congolese must fulfill. I don't support 'stay at home' politics. Voters should be free to choose their preferred candidates,"" said Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu. The Catholic Church has a long history of promoting democracy in the vast African country where organizing elections has been complicated by financial and logistical problems, and disputes over vote tampering have frequently caused widespread unrest. 
09:30: ""It is a total chaos,"" said presidential candidate Martin Fayulu, one of the main contenders for the Congolese presidency. ""If all the people don't vote in all the polling stations indicated by the CENI (national election commission), we won't accept these elections,"" Fayulu warned after casting his ballot, adding that he would be at the forefront of any protest.
08:37: Congolese journalist Adrien Ambanengo reports that the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) has postponed the election in the Kabongo territory of Haut Lomami in south-eastern Katanga province by three days. He said residents told him that CENI gave no reason for the postponement. 
08:24: Voting has begun in Kinshasa, Goma, and north-eastern Kisangani, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.
08:02: DW correspondent Wendy Bashi says the deliveries of voting equipment to a polling station she visited in the Masina municipality of Kinshasa's Tshangu district have been delayed.
07:42: A Paris-based voter says it took five minutes to cast her ballot at the Congolese Embassy in the French capital. 
07:27: A voter in the capital Kinshasa tells the Associated Press (AP) that he's voting for hope. ""When you wake up in the morning you're hoping for good things, good work, and I want security,""  Raymond Yuma says. According to AP, the voting cards Yuma and three others who are also waiting to cast their ballots have are not illegible.
07:01: Supporters of Joelle Bile, who withdrew from the presidential race on December 15, say they will accompany her to the polls to cast her ballot. The former journalist and one of only two women candidates in the presidential race, is now backing incumbent Tshisekedi. 
06:42: In the city of Goma, in volatile eastern Congo, many voters are still waiting for polling stations to open, according to DW correspondent Zanem Nety Zaidi. ""I’m here at the Zanner Institute Center in downtown Goma and it is already after 8 a.m. but the voting station is not yet open. People are still streaming in and the police and observers are on hand to monitor the voting process,"" he says.  
06:18: Polling stations have opened in the general election, and will close at 5 p.m. local time (16:00 GMT), though polling booths will stay open if there are people still waiting in line so they can cast their ballots. A holiday has been declared for the election, and borders have been closed and domestic flights suspended as during previous votes.

""We will not tolerate any foreign-controlled violence in Germany,"" the ministry wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
The Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court had earlier convicted a German-Iranian national for conspiring an attack on a synagogue in Germany in November 2022 and had sentenced him to prison for two years and nine months.
The accused was identified as Babak J. who had planned an attack on a synagogue in the western city of Bochum but instead threw his incendiary device at a school. The school building had minor damage but no one was injured.

The court said the accused had chosen to attack the school because he found the synagogue secured too well.
The Foreign Ministry said it would carefully study the judgment to determine the ""consequences and next steps, including at EU-level.""
As the court delivered its verdict in the case, it said the attack had been planned with the help of ""Iranian state agencies.""
The court also suspected that the case of an arson attack and shots fired at a rabbi's house in Essen last year was also linked to the planned arson attack in Bochum.
In recent years, Germany has witnessed a rise in antisemitism. The situation has become more alarming since the Israel-Hamas war began.

https://www.dw.com/en/in-north-korea-torture-awaits-those-deported-from-china/a-67767407,HUMAN RIGHTS,"In North Korea, torture awaits those deported from China 20.12.2023","Kim Cheol Ok managed a hasty phone call to inform her family about her imminent deportation to North Korea on October 9.
On that day, Cheol Ok and 500 other North Koreans living in China were forcibly repatriated. Her bigger sister in London, who managed to escape during the Great Famine of the 1990s, fears for her life.
""I am sure she is being beaten,"" Kim Kyu Li tells DW in her London flat, where she lives in exile.
In North Korea, prisoners often die from starvation and illnesses caused by malnutrition.
""They eat mice and cockroaches and get sick from it,"" Kyu Li says.
When Cheol Ok arrived in China at the age of just 14, she was married off to a man 30 years her senior by a trafficker. Together, they had a daughter, who is a Chinese citizen.
However, Cheol Ok was never granted a Chinese residence permit and, for 25 years, lived in seclusion in a rural area in China's northeastern Jilin province. She worked in the fields and later in restaurants. Her husband treated her well despite the circumstances, according to her sister Kyu Li. 
But that all changed earlier this year. In April 2023, she was arrested by the Chinese police, presumably during an attempt to leave the country.
""She didn't do anything. Her only offense was that she was born in North Korea,"" says Kyu Li. 

Cheol Ok's deportation to North Korea has opened wounds in her family that have never fully healed.
Alongside Kyu Li, a second older sister now resides in London. Kim Yu Bin was once deported back from China to North Korea before she eventually managed to escape. The memory of her own abuse and mistreatment haunts her to this day. 
""Ever since my sister was arrested, I have terrible nightmares,"" she shares with DW. 
Yu Bin mentions that her brother died in North Korean custody, the details of his harrowing death relayed through fellow inmates who managed to escape.
""He was beaten to death, stuffed into a rice sack, and thrown away,"" she says. ""It broke my heart."" 
The family's greatest fear now is that Cheol Ok may face a similar fate.
DW also spoke to other North Koreans who had been deported back to their home country from China before finally managing to escape to South Korea. They say they were treated inhumanely while detained. 
""We were treated as if we were less than animals,"" 50-year-old Lee Young Joo says in a video interview from her home in South Korea.
She was regularly beaten during interrogations. 
""If I hesitated for even a second to answer questions, they had already prepared the baton to torture me with,"" she says. ""I was beaten all over, including my head and face.""
More than 1,000 eyewitness accounts have been collected by Korea Future, an organization that documents human rights abuses in the North Korean penal system. 
North Koreans who manage to escape the country and are repatriated face a brutal interrogation process aimed at determining their motives for leaving. 
Did they flee to escape poverty, or were they attempting to make it to South Korea? The regime considers the latter an especially heinous crime as South Korea is considered its archenemy.
Pyongyang also hunts down diplomats who have defected and hackers who once did its bidding in China, according to information obtained by DW's investigative unit. 
""Detainees, regardless of whether they are classified as economic or political criminals, experience positional torture,"" says Yoo Suyeon from Korea Future. ""This means they are forced to sit cross-legged for more than 12 hours every day. Any movement or sound can result in individual or collective punishment.""
Despite the growing reports of torture in North Korea, China continues to deport North Koreans to their country of origin. 
""China actually has obligations under both the refugee convention and protocol, as well as the torture convention, not to send back people to countries where they would face torture,"" says international law expert Ethan Hee-Seok Shin from the Transitional Justice Working Group, which filed a petition to the UN on Cheol Ok's behalf.
Earlier this year, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights official asked China, Pyongyang's closest ally, to end its forced repatriation of North Koreans, saying it could ""put them at risk of serious human rights violations such as arbitrary detention, torture, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.""
But Beijing has dismissed the allegations, saying there is ""currently no evidence of torture or so-called 'massive human rights violations' in North Korea."" 
Instead, China classifies North Koreans as irregular economic migrants and not refugees, effectively denying them protection by the Geneva Refugee Convention.
DW has repeatedly sought comments from both the Chinese and North Korean governments. China did not respond, while North Korea's Embassy in Berlin, in a brief written statement, dismissed the accusations in connection with the deportations as ""misleading propaganda"" by ""the United States and hostile forces.""
The families of detainees in North Korea often choose to remain silent, fearing to expose their loved ones to additional danger. However, Kim Kyu Li has opted to make the fight for her missing sister public. She even traveled to New York to raise her voice at a recent meeting of the International Criminal Court.
In her London flat, she directly addresses her missing sister, even though she knows her sibling can't hear her. 
""Cheol Ok, stay strong and don't give up.""
Kim Cheol Ok is unlikely to be released from prison, says Ethan Hee-Seok Shin, whose organization supports her family. 
""But at least their hope and our hope, too, is that this kind of international attention will make it more difficult for the North Korean authorities to abuse or torture her.""

https://www.dw.com/en/france-passes-controversial-immigration-bill/a-67772998,POLITICS,France passes controversial immigration bill 20.12.2023,"Lawmakers in the French parliament passed legislation on Tuesday that will bring in stricter controls on migration.
President Emmanuel Macron had been facing a rebellion from within his party after the bill won support from the far-right National Rally (RN), led by Marine Le Pen.
But in the end, it passed through the lower house with votes from Macron's centrist coalition and conservative lawmakers.
Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin — who had spearheaded the bill — expressed relief after a large majority voted in favor, meaning it no longer depended on the support from those far-right lawmakers. 
The subject of immigration is a major political plank for the upcoming parliamentary elections. While the passing of the bill would have favored Macron, the support shown by Le Pen — who called the stricter bill ""a great ideological victory"" for the far right — can also improve her chances in the elections.
Several left-wing ministers have voiced opposition to the bill, and Health Minister Aurelien Rousseau has resigned in protest against the tightening of immigration legislation. Rousseau had only held the post for five months.
Ever since the bill was first submitted, it has seen various amendments toughening the immigration rules, with the left accusing the government of giving in to the pressure from the far right.
To make the legislation more agreeable for the right, the government decided to weaken measures that would have allowed some immigrants residency permits. The government also agreed to extend the duration of stay in France for migrants to be eligible to access welfare benefits.
With the new legislation, access to housing benefits will be also be delayed for unemployed non-EU migrants by five years.
In order to gain the support of the right, the government has also introduced migration quotas which will make it more difficult for immigrants' children to become French.
While now it will be easier for migrants working in sectors that lack labour to get a residency permit, it will also be easier to expel illegal migrants.
Prime Minister Borne said that Macron would be submitting the law to the Consitutional Council for review, as the government had some misgivings regarding the consitutionality of some points in the legislation.
The body is effectively France's constitutional court, it examines whether a law is in accordance with the French constitution before it goes into effect, or whether it needs amendment.
The decision has to be made within 30 days, or in urgent cases within eight days. If Macron appeals to the Constitutional Council before Christmas, it should be clear in January whether he can bring the law into force in its current form or whether it needs to be amended.

https://www.dw.com/en/why-chileans-rejected-new-constitution-proposals/a-67767057,POLITICS,Why Chileans rejected new constitution proposals 19.12.2023,"The ""no"" didn't come as a surprise. Many Chileans had voiced disillusion about the outcome of the constitutional process in the weeks and months before the referendum. On Sunday, a majority of voters rejected a proposal for a new constitution for the second time in 15 months.
In the wake of protests that started in late 2019 and took place for months all over Chile –– at least 30 people died and hundreds were injured in violent riots, looting and arson, which the police cracked down upon heavily  –– the Chilean government decided to hold a national referendum asking citizens if they wanted a new constitution. Roughly 78% voted ""yes"" in October 2020.

A constituent body, called the Constitutional Convention, was established to draft a new constitution to replace the current charter, which was written in 1980 during the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, who ruled the South American country from 1973 when he took power in a military coup until he stepped down in 1990, paving the way for democratization. 
The constitution has since been modified several times, but many Chileans criticize the fact that it is still anchored in the era of dictatorship, a time of massive human rights violations.
Though some argue that Chile became one of the region's most stable and prosperous countries under the current constitution, others emphasize economic inequalities were cemented.
On September 4, 2022, Chilean voters rejected the first draft of a new constitution with a majority of 62%, and on Sunday, 56% voted against another new proposal.
Mariana Llanos, the co-director of the GIGA Institute of Latin American Studies in Hamburg, told DW that ""the electorate acted like the adult in the room,"" sensing that neither proposal was adequate and that both would have caused damage to Chile's democracy.
Both times, the reasons for the rejection were similar, she explained: ""The first proposal was regarded by the normal, centrist electorate [as being] too left-wing, while this proposal went the other way, too much to the right,"" She and other experts agree that there is currently no liberal centrist party that could realistically govern the country. 

The 2019/2020 protests broke out after a slight rise in public transit fares in the Chilean capital Santiago. But deep discontent over the neo-liberal model that Pinochet established had been simmering for decades. The political momentum from the protests boosted left parties in the country and led to a  win for Gabriel Boric.
However, after the first proposal for a new constitution was rejected, the political pendulum swung. The following proposed constitution was even more right-wing than its current iteration, said Llanos.
A first draft, elaborated by experts in the first half of 2023, had been more ""balanced,"" Claudia Heiss, the head of political science at the University of Chile in Santiago, said in November in the Americas Quarterly podcast: ""[It] was, of course, not what the left likes, it was also not what the right would prefer, and I think that's how it should be. It was a text with minimal agreement among groups that don't agree,"" she said.  
But, Heiss said that other issues, such as tax rules and migration that do not belong in a constitution, then found their way into the text. ""I think this constitution has a lot of populist traits.""
Günther Maihold, the deputy director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, or SWP, agreed. The Latin America expert told DW that it was not ""unusual"" for Latin American politicians to interpret a constitution as a Christmas ""wish list,"" to which everybody wants to add something from their own political agenda.

Analyzing the rejection of the proposals for a new constitution, some experts have pointed out that the electorate doesn't want polarization, despite the continued belief of many Chilean politicians that it is a recipe for success. ""Many social scientists have argued that really the polarization is more prevalent among elites than among citizens,"" said Heiss.
""I think it's a moment of discouragement. It's a sad moment because we have been unable to agree on basic rules that allow every political sector to feel that they have an even field to do regular politics,"" she told Americas Quarterly after the draft of the second proposal was released.
""There are specific foundational moments where a consensus is possible, and a document appears that is able to bring together all political camps,"" Maihold said, adding that this was currently not the case among Chile's political class. 
For now, Chileans will have to make do with their old constitution. President Boric made clear before Sunday's referendum that he would not try a third time.

https://www.dw.com/en/sweden-upholds-life-sentence-in-iran-prison-executions-case/a-67771180,RULE OF LAW,Sweden upholds life sentence in Iran prison executions case 19.12.2023,"Sweden's Svea Court of Appeals on Tuesday upheld a July 2022 Stockholm District Court decision finding Iranian Hamid Nouri guilty of ""grave breaches of international humanitarian law and murder.""
The lower court's decision to sentence Nouri to life in prison for his role in the 1988 mass execution of political prisoners in Iran was also upheld.
""Our assessment is that the prosecutor's case is robust and compelling overall, and that the District Court was correct to find the prosecutor's charges largely substantiated,"" said Court of Appeals Judge Robert Green.
Nouri is accused of having directly assisted in the mass execution of political dissidents in Iranian prisons. It is estimated that 5,000 or more people were summarily killed in the purge.
Nouri is the only person ever to stand trial for the killings. He has consistently proclaimed his innocence and his lawyers had called for an acquittal or a reduced sentence.
The case was tried under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows courts to try individuals no matter where their crimes were allegedly committed. Sweden is one of several predominantly European countries, including Germany, which have such laws and have started to make use of them in recent years, for instance with defendants accused of crimes during Syria's civil war or the Islamic State's occupation of parts of Syria and Iraq.  
This principle, as well as that of international arrest warrants and extradition treaties, give hope to rights groups and victims that some perpetrators of crime who may operate with impunity at home, could one day face arrest and trial for their crimes beyond their borders.
The 1988 executions were allegedly ordered by then Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini in retaliation for attacks by the opposition People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) at the close of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War.
The Nouri case touches a nerve in Tehran, as numerous government officials — including the current Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi — are accused of having served on the committees that condemned imprisoned dissidents to death.
The decision to try Nouri incensed Tehran, which called the case against him politically motivated.
As the trial got under way in April 2022, Iran's Islamist government arrested 33-year-old Swedish diplomat Johan Floderus, who was reportedly returning home from a vacation in Iran with friends.
Floderus was subsequently charged with spying on behalf of Israel and of ""corruption on earth"" — the Iranian government's catch-all term for crimes it considers capital offenses, which can be many and varied in nature but usually claim to pertain to somehow defying Islam. 
In May, Iran executed Swedish-Iranian militant political activist Habib Chaab on charges of corruption on earth.
Sweden has requested the release of Floderus, who has been imprisoned for more than 600 days.
Iranian-Swedish academic Ahmadreza Djalali, who was arrested in Iran in 2016, also faces execution on espionage charges.
There has been some speculation of a possible prisoner swap in the Swedish media but Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom has declined to comment on the matter.
Tuesday's Appeals Court decision was greeted with cheers from protesters, mainly exiled Iranians, gathered outside the court.

https://www.dw.com/en/congo-election-north-kivu-hopes-next-president-brings-peace/a-67737240,POLITICS,Congo election: North Kivu hopes next president brings peace 19.12.2023,"Mahoro Esperance is no stranger to navigating the dangers of conflict in and around her home. The 23-year-old mother of one was born in the territory of Masisi, one of the most unstable areas in the Congolese province of North Kivu.
Most recently, her region was the scene of clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) rebels and the Congolese army, prompting her to take refuge in a camp in a safer region.
Wracked with anxiety, Esperance — a seamstress by trade — tries to busy herself with sewing projects to take her mind off things. But it doesn't seem to be working. As she prepares to vote in the upcoming general election on December 20, the only solution she can think of is a ""powerful"" president who pushes hard for peace.
""That's what we need, because here we're suffering terribly,"" she told DW.
""If peace were to return, my life would undoubtedly change. Because I could go back to our village and do my work as a seamstress. Here, I don't find customers who pay well. They pay me between 200 (€0.06-€0.17) and 500 Congolese francs, whereas back home I [was paid] more than that."" 
Esperance is far from alone with her concerns. Teachers in North Kivu also expect the new president to take good care of them.
Jean Kaongo has been teaching for over 20 years. Now working in a public school, he said he is unable to provide for his family. He believes the president should make the well-being of teachers a priority following the election.
""We hope that the president will look after teachers well,"" he told DW. ""Life would be better then, because I'll be able to look after my family, clothe them and feed them. I could buy land where I could build, or even find rent so my family could live comfortably.""
Ever since fighting broke out in North Kivu in late 2021, socioeconomic activities have declined. Traders who once brought supplies from villages in the region have been unable to work in such dangerous conditions.
Trader Hamuli Shombo had to suspend his activities in and around Goma. He thinks the new president's first task should be to get the security situation under control so that he can get his livelihood back on track.
""Where there's no war, there's bound to be peace. Then everything will be easy to find, like food,"" he told DW.
""The agricultural products we used to bring from the surrounding regions can no longer reach the town of Goma, because the roads are closed. But if there's peace, food products can circulate easily.""
With Congo's general election fast approaching, election observers and the opposition are already concerned about a lack of transparency. They've cited issues such as illegible voter cards, electoral list delays and confusion over polling stations.
And some voters in the areas of North Kivu province occupied by M23 fighters won't be able to cast their ballots, due to the ongoing conflict.
""We fear there will be a mess on election day,"" said Luc Lutala, coordinator of the Symocel observer mission. ""Voters who don't know where to vote are voters who are stripped of their right to vote.""
Disputes over perceived electoral malpractice frequently spark violent unrest in the conflict-ridden country. Challengers to President Felix Tshisekedi — who is running for a second term in office — have called out what they claim to be an uneven playing field. They've said the authorities are planning to tip the vote in his favor through voter roll fraud.
""There is no longer democracy in this country,"" said presidential candidate Moise Katumbi, a 58-year-old mining magnate who is considered a potential front-runner.
Tshisekedi, 60, has presented himself as the most stable choice to Congo's 44 million registered voters. Congo only saw its first handover of presidential power in 2019, albeit in an election marred by voter suppression, widespread irregularities and violence.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-bavaria-can-hang-crosses-in-state-buildings/a-67769430,LAW AND JUSTICE,Germany: Bavaria can hang crosses in state buildings 19.12.2023,"Crosses mounted in the entrances of the state's administrative buildings in Bavaria can stay up, Germany's highest court for most administrative law disputes ruled on Tuesday. 
In 2018, Bavarian state premier Markus Söder of the Christian Social Union (CSU) ordered that all public buildings prominently hang a cross ""as an expression of Bavaria's historical and cultural character.""
A Bavarian lobby group advocating ""the meaningful separation of church and state as well as the eradication of church privileges,"" whose German name might roughly translate to the Association for Free Thinking for Bavaria (bfg Bayern), challenged the decree in court.
It argued the move infringed on people's freedom of religion and violated the state's obligation to be neutral on such matters.
The court, however, found that the regulation was a ""mere administrative regulation with no external legal effect and therefore did not violate any rights of the plaintiffs.""
The court said that while ""the crosses brought in do display a central symbol of the Christian faith to an objective observer,"" they nevertheless had no legal impact on visitors' religious freedom. 
Söder welcomed the decision on social media.
""The cross is a symbol of our Christian and cultural character. It is part of Bavaria,"" he said. 
The Bavarian group said it was considering its legal options, including taking the case to the Federal Constitutional Court — Germany's highest.
""It's not over yet,"" Assunta Tammelleo, the association's chairperson, said.

When the cross requirement was first announced, it sparked a heated debate in Germany and drew criticism from the Protestant church and even from the Catholic German Bishop's Conference.
The churches were worried the issue was being misused ahead of a state election that year, which the CSU went on to win. 
On Tuesday, just before the court's judgment, the Archbishop of Munich, Cardinal Reinhard Marx said he was ""very much in favor of the cross in public space.""
""The cross cannot be made to disappear in Bavaria,"" he said.

Bavaria, Germany's second-most populous state, is home to the country's largest Catholic population by some margin. According to 2011 census figures — the most recent available — 55% of Bavarians were estimated to be Catholic, compared to 21% Protestant, 6% Muslim, and around 20% who either held another religion or none.
Only the much smaller western German state of Saarland had a larger proportion of Catholics in its population, at 63%.

https://www.dw.com/en/are-polands-populist-bankers-a-problem-for-pm-donald-tusk/a-67706140,BUSINESS,Are Poland's populist bankers a problem for PM Donald Tusk? 19.12.2023,"The agenda of Poland's outgoing ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS) was generally based on centralized control and financial nationalism. Many assumed this stance was rooted in ideological conviction.
But that's not necessarily so. ""The Polish case demonstrates that business may also sometimes unexpectedly push for greater state interventionism in the economy,"" says Marek Naczyk, an associate professor of Comparative Social Policy at Oxford University. 
A coalition government led by Donald Tusk, leader of the largest opposition Civic Platform party, or PO, was sworn in on December 13 after winning the October 15 elections. The party, last in government from 2007 to 2014, was by and large economically liberal. But it has since shifted to the left , promising to maintain PiS policy on universal welfare benefits, hiking public sector pay and not promising tax cuts to the nascent middle class. 
But it's how it chooses to deal with the domestic banking community that will show where the new government's priorities lie. Given its need to restore judicial independence, media freedoms and repair relations with the EU, it may have less inclination to take on the bankers who supported PiS.
Naczyk says that Poland has hugely benefited from foreign direct investment (FDI) in manufacturing industries, and that creating ""national champions"" has helped create jobs. In the long run, this has strengthened Polish democracy and its capacity to play a reliable role in European integration, he says. 
But while strategic policy moves undoubtedly matter, in the Polish case the driving force behind the rise of financial nationalism — not only under PiS, but also under the previous PO governments — was a mobilization of Polish managerial elites, particularly bankers,Naczyk believes.
""It was not PiS politicians who triggered the 'repolonization' of Poland's heavily foreign-controlled banking sector. Rather, it was Polish bankers who did it,"" he says. 
""They successfully pressed government actors to create new development institutions — Polish Investments for Development (PIR) in 2011 and the Polish Development Fund (PFR) in 2016 — to support the growth of Polish-owned 'national champions,'"" he adds.
As is the case in other dependent market economies in Central and Eastern Europe, the Polish banking sector had been overwhelmingly controlled by foreign capital. This became a problem during the global financial crisis of 2008 when foreign parent banks started trying to claim their Polish subsidiaries' excess liquidity in order to improve their own positions.
Naczyk says the Polish-born top managers of these subsidiaries, like the outgoing prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, typically resisted such attempts and became concerned about their lack of managerial autonomy. Key decisions were not made in Poland but in the parent company's foreign headquarters. Managers also bristled at the negative macroeconomic impact of excessive foreign ownership of banks, since decisions made in foreign headquarters could lead to credit crunches in Poland. 
""It is bankers themselves who managed to co-opt leading PiS politicians to further their own, much better defined, agenda for developmentalism,” Naczyk says.

Unlike PiS, PO has refrained from openly politicizing the Polish economy's excessive dependence on foreign capital in recent years, according to Naczyk. 
""Yet I do not expect the PO-led government's effective approach to foreign capital to be significantly different from the PiS approach,"" he says.
Political parties that will be part of the new coalition government have never used the term ""re-polonization"" because of its nationalist and illiberal connotations, he says.
But the PO-led government is likely to continue supporting some forms of ""economic patriotism"" while, at the same time, trying to attract greater FDI, Naczyk believes. 
Previously, these Polish bankers had stressed developmentalist approaches, which turned out to be half-baked, says Jan Boguslawski, a political economist at Sciences Po Paris.
Developmentalists see policy as a tool for shifting a nation's economy up the global supply chain, for example by focusing on companies and sectors that have the potential to become market leaders. It often requires quite authoritarian methods as it usually focuses on some sectors at the expense of others, needing, therefore, to mitigate socio-political fallout. 
In Poland, the PiS-led government after 2015 set up channels for selecting ""National Champions,"" the main one being the investment fund PFR (Polish development fund). 

But today, Poland is still a laggard in terms of investments that boost domestic competitiveness in the long run, including research and development (R&D), education and the green transition, he notes.
The country currently spends less than 1.5% of GDP on R&D — roughly half the average of Western Europe — while low private investment rates and declining public education expenditures, accompanied by a stagnant demography and a bias toward the elderly in social policy, all hinder a pro-innovation climate. 
Bogulslawski doesn't anticipate any major policy changes in the financial sector now that a PO-led government is in place. 
For PO, re-privatizing banks such as Pekao and Alior would not be strategically advantageous. It would provide PiS with political ammunition, and the new government will gladly take the opportunity to take control over some of the largest financial institutions in the country, he says. 
""PO may incrementally scale down the developmentalist agenda that flourished under PiS,"" Boguslawski says. They've shown a preference for channeling more resources towards private sector involvement, he adds.

https://www.dw.com/en/rwanda-explained-from-politics-to-human-rights-and-refugees/a-67762463,POLITICS,Rwanda explained: From politics to human rights and refugees 19.12.2023,"In an interview published on December 17, German politician Jens Spahn, a member of the opposition center-right Christian Democrats, floated the idea of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda for processing, similar to the model proposed by Britain.
Spahn's suggestion was immediately dismissed by Germany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, who called the idea ""downright childishly naive"" during a visit to Rwanda on Monday.
But the suggestion shows how the idea of offshore processing is gaining traction. It also underlines Rwanda's success in positioning itself as an international haven for asylum seekers.
Here's what you need to know about Rwanda's government, economy, human rights situation and refugee policy.
President Paul Kagame and the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) have ruled Rwanda, a small East African nation dominated by rugged mountains and fertile plains, since the end of the 1994 genocide.
On paper, the country is a multiparty democracy. But political opposition is ""nonexistent,"" as the US development agency USAID puts it.
Kagame's three election victories have been plagued by numerous and credible accusations of irregularities, including vote rigging and intimidation. Officially, he won the 2017 presidency with 99% of the vote.
The nation is designated an ""electoral autocracy"" by the Varieties of Democracy Project, an international democracy database. And it earned only eight out of 40 possible points for political rights in the 2023 Freedom in the World report.
Rwanda has ratified international and regional instruments guaranteeing human rights, which are also anchored in its constitution and other national laws.
But several observers have identified significant rights issues in Rwanda, including extrajudicial killings, people being disappeared by the government and torture of dissenters.
This has had a chilling effect on freedom of expression and association by perpetuating ""a culture of intolerance of dissent,"" finds Human Rights Watch.
As for media freedom, ""beaten down by decades of oppression, the Rwandan media landscape is one of the poorest in Africa,"" says Reporter without Borders, which ranks the country 131 out of 180 on its 2023 press freedom index.
In 1994, Kagame inherited a nation torn apart by the genocide that saw a million ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus slaughtered in just 100 days, and destroyed Rwanda's economy.
Rwanda's economy still depends on subsistence agriculture and lacks the rich natural resources of many of its neighbors.
But reform-minded Kagame has steered Rwanda to strong economic growth and ""substantial improvements"" in living standards, according to the World Bank. GDP soared by 142% from 2000 to 2020 and the number of people living under the poverty line fell to 52% by 2016-17. The country cut maternal and child mortality, and its 13 million people now are among the longest-living in sub-Saharan Africa.
Ranked one of the least corrupt nations in Africa, Rwanda has also climbed 100 places in the past decade for the ease of doing business, to second on the continent.
Rwanda is below average, however, compared to other low-income African countries when it comes to private investment, which is hindered by factors such as the low-skilled workforce, its landlocked position and the high price of electricity.
With its stability and low corruption, Rwanda has become an aid ""darling,"" receiving $1 billion a year (€914 million) — the most donor aid per capita in East Africa.
""It's the country that illustrates how development aid has been effectively used if all you're looking at is things like clean roads and nice fancy buildings … but not paying attention to peace and security, its role in regional politics and, indeed, human rights,"" said Toni Haastrup, who holds the Chair in Global Politics at the UK's University of Manchester.
It's a mixed bag.
Rwanda hosts nearly 135,000 refugees, mainly from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Not forced to live in a camp like in many other nations, they enjoy freedom of movement and have the right to work, own property, register businesses and open bank accounts.
Rwanda's ""economic inclusion"" refugee policies ""stand out as a model with lessons learned for East Africa and beyond,"" finds a 2023 report by Refugees International.
Despite this, refugees in Rwanda face prejudice and discrimination and most refugees are chronically poor. The vast majority (93%) live in camps and rely on a meager cash assistance of 10,000 Rwandan francs ($7.94 or € 7.27) a month to buy food.
Burundian refugee Kelly Nimubona told DW last year that life was tough in Rwanda. ''We can't afford to eat twice a day,"" he said, adding that there was no chance of getting work.
As well as the poverty, rights organizations say Rwanda's human rights record makes it no country for refugees.
Tellingly, the UK Supreme Court ruled in November that asylum seekers wouldn't be safe in Rwanda.

Last month, Rwanda received a new batch of refugees evacuated from Libya's notorious detention centers under a UNHCR partnership.
The country was also part of a now defunct and controversial policy to receive rejected asylum seekers from Israel. More recently, Rwanda signed agreements with the UK and Denmark to process asylum seekers, although either nation has yet to send any migrants.
Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolo told local news site KT Press that Rwanda kept an open policy for refugees because people in the country know ""what it is to be on the move, or to be displaced, just because of the history of our country.""
But for global politics expert Toni Haastrup, Rwanda's refugee policy serves another purpose.
""It's a way of legitimating Rwanda within the international community,"" she told DW. ""You're not going to scold Rwanda in global politics if it's been accepting all of these refugees on your behalf.""

https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-love-of-sparkling-wine-loses-its-fizz/a-67764433,SOCIETY,Germany's love of sparkling wine loses its fizz 19.12.2023,"Germans drank about a fifth less sparkling wine in 2022 as in 2012, according to figures released by the Federal Statistics Office, Destatis, on Tuesday.
The study appears to support recent data showing that, while Germans are among the biggest consumers of alcohol in the world, consumption is falling — especially among young people.
Destatis said that, on average in 2022, each person aged 16 and over in Germany drank five bottles of sparkling wine or 38 glasses of 0.1 liters each.
In a 10-year comparison, consumption fell by 21.2% compared with 2012, when each person drank 6.6 bottles — or 49 glasses — of sparkling wines, including sekt (German sparkling wine), prosecco, cava and champagne. 
Per capita consumption was up on 2021, a time still significantly affected by the coronavirus pandemic when parties and other holiday events only took place to a limited degree.
The study was based on statistics available because of the sparkling wine tax, introduced more than 100 years ago to finance Germany's imperial war fleet — which is still levied.
In 2022, Germany's national government collected around €352 million ($385 million) from the sparkling wine tax.

It only accounted for 0.04% of total federal, state, and local tax revenue.
Destatis noted that, in comparison, €600 million flowed to Germany's states from the beer tax, which, unlike the sparkling wine tax, is a state tax.
The tax was passed in 1902 by Germany's then-parliament, the Reichstag, to meet a shortfall in defense spending and has remained in place ever since, despite various amendments.
Germany's socialist Left Party has called the sparkling wine tax, which did not apply in the former East Germany, ""a symbol of militarism"" and has urged its abolition.
The neoliberal Free Democrats and the far-right Alternative for Germany also want the duty abolished, citing excessive bureaucracy and relatively low revenue.

https://www.dw.com/en/hope-not-all-doom-and-gloom-lots-of-progress-and-innovations-e-mobility-renewables-paris-climate/a-67701002,NATURE AND ENVIRONMENT,5 reasons to be hopeful about the climate 19.12.2023,"With carbon emissions set to reach record highs this year and global climate action falling short, it can be easy to slide into despair.
But according to a new study by the German think tank New Climate Institute, there are many reasons to remain hopeful.
The study looks at technological and societal progress in limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) as agreed in Paris in 2015 and highlights key global trends that suggest all is not lost.
The authors wrote that understanding the causes and impacts of climate change has come a long way since the Paris Agreement was adopted.
Climate change has now become a mainstream issue and is discussed among a larger segment of the population. Media coverage has also increased but so too has climate misinformation and fake news. 
Growing awareness has led to more climate protests, with young people leading global calls for urgent action in movements such as Fridays for Future, Extinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil and the Last Generation.
And people are taking to the courtroom as well as onto the streets. The report highlights a rising wave of climate litigation against states and companies. Plaintiffs are pushing for compliance with legislation to protect the environment and climate with some success. Germany passed legislation to accelerate greenhouse gas emissions cuts by 2030 after a 2021 Federal Constitutional Court ruling. 
Advances in weather attribution science, which investigates the links between extreme weather and climate change, have helped bolster legal cases.
Before the Paris Agreement, climate policies focused on reducing emissions in specific sectors, according to the authors. Today, achieving net-zero emissions across the entire economy is the goal for many countries, regions, and cities across the globe. 
By the end of 2021, 90% of the global economy included some kind of net-zero target that was leading to discussions of full decarbonization. 
""That was previously politically not acceptable,"" stated the report.
Increased ambition has not yet translated into global emissions reductions, but the authors wrote the world is on a better path than before. 
Sustainable investments were a niche endeavor over a decade ago and have ""now become a standard model in the finance world,"" according to the report.
The threat of climate litigation against companies is heating up, too. Businesses and investors are increasingly responding to societal pressure for change and recognizing the growing risk climate change poses to their wealth.
The authors also noted that the risk of investing in fossil fuels that could potentially no longer be burned or in infrastructure that may soon become defunct is making banks more reluctant to finance new coal power plants. 
Many companies are now publishing their climate risks partly on their own initiative or because of new laws. Of the 500 largest US companies listed by credit rating agency Standard & Poor's, more than 70% also disclose their emissions.
Still, according to the authors, oil and gas-based business models remain very lucrative and still dominate the market. Business models are shifting, but too slowly. Corporate lobbying is often hampering climate action.
Renewable energy costs have plummeted in the last decade at an even faster speed than predicted. They are now cheaper than new fossil fuels in 90% of the world and the cheapest source of bulk electricity generation.
Renewables such as solar and wind providing the core of global energy systems ""is a new normal,"" according to the authors. Phasing out fossil fuels ""is no longer a question of 'if' but 'when.'"" 










At the same time, the supply of renewable power is becoming increasingly decentralized, improving energy access for many private households. Investments in renewables are now five times greater than in fossil fuels.
While gaps in the deployment of wind, heat pumps and electrolyzers used to create hydrogen fuel still exist, the report stated that a ""paradigm shift on multiple levels towards renewable energy has started that cannot be reversed."" 
Electrification is playing an increasingly important role in transport and heating.
According to the study, electrically powered heat pumps are becoming the ""key technology for decarbonization"" of building heating systems. Europe saw a 38% increase in sales of heat pumps last year. 
Electric car sales worldwide have also risen much faster than expected. By 2023, 18% of all new cars sold will likely be electric, according to the study. In some countries around the world, they are already standard. All major car manufacturers have pledged to go electric in the next few years. The European Union, Canada and Chile have also set deadlines for phasing out combustion engines.

Although, high prices and the need for more investment in charging infrastructure remain roadblocks, the electrification of vehicles has grown exponentially according to the report. That's particularly the case in rich industrialized countries and China, where more and more electric trucks and buses are hitting the road.
While far more action is needed to reach the Paris Agreement targets, the authors emphasized that the world can ""draw strength"" from a continued increase in awareness, knowledge and technical know-how in tackling the climate crisis.

https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-top-court-orders-2021-election-rerun-in-berlin/a-67763915,POLITICS,Germany's top court orders 2021 election rerun in Berlin 19.12.2023,"The 2021 federal election must be partially repeated in Berlin, Germany's Federal Constitutional Court ruled on Tuesday.
The court said that there had been multiple errors in the vote count in several Berlin constituencies.
The election must be repeated in 455 electoral districts and the corresponding postal voting districts, presiding Judge Doris Köng said.
The election in Berlin was marked by long queues and missing paper ballots.
The vote, which took place on September 26, 2021, was for the state election, the city's 12 district assemblies, the German national election and a local referendum.
A loophole allowed ineligible minors to vote in state and federal elections by using a mail-in ballot ordered by someone 18 or over, and mail-in ballots for different elections had to be put in a single envelope.
Berlin authorities scrambled to correct mistakes a few days before polling day by warning local stations to change their procedures to prevent fraud during counting. But another loophole — allowing German nationals living outside Germany to vote in local elections using the same trick — was not closed in time.
The Berlin Marathon was also held on the same day, making it more difficult for replacement ballots to be delivered in some constituencies.
The state's Constitutional Court had annulled the state and municipal elections.
A rerun of the 2021 municipal election was carried out early in 2023. The conservative CDU took the largest share of the vote and successfully ousted the previous mayor, who belonged to the center-left Social Democrats (SPD).

Germany's struggling Left Party voiced relief on Tuesday, as it became clear that the ruling would not affect the seats it holds in Berlin. 
Had it done so, it could have led to the party falling below the 5% threshold in the national parliament. 
One of its MPs, Gesine Lötzsch, won't face a recount at all, while the partial rerun in Gregor Gysi's district is too small to endanger the large majority he won. 
The Left Party disbanded its parliamentary faction last month when influential member Sahra Wagenknecht pushed ahead with her longstanding threat to form a splinter group.

Dorji's latest film, ""The Monk and the Gun,"" is his way of untying the knot that was his homeland's social, political and cultural transition in the mid-2000s. 
""I was growing up during this period and 'The Monk and the Gun' is a story about the change and transition that Bhutan went through in the 2000s, when we became the last country in the world to allow television, to allow the internet and to allow democracy to come in,"" Dorji said. 
But as a Bhutanese living in India, where his father was a diplomat, and returning to his homeland for school holidays, he had a unique perspective on the changes that were engulfing the Himalayan kingdom.  
""In Bhutan, we have a saying that you cannot see your eyelashes because they are so close to you. For me, that was the situation. A lot of Bhutanese at that time could not see the changes and the impact of that transition because it was so close to them,"" Dorji told DW in Thimphu, Bhutan's capital. 
""But for me, as a Bhutanese living abroad, I could see how our society and culture was changing — and I always thought this would make an amazing story to share with the world. It's a story of where we as Bhutanese came from and where we are going."" 
The film is set in 2006, as Bhutan shifts to a democracy and the government organizes mock elections to teach the people how to vote. In a connected plotline, an American collector of antique weapons arrives in search of a legendary rifle that falls into the hands of a monk. 
The story is political satire and gentle comedy with elements of suspense combined with touching scenes, Dorji says, with audiences in different parts of the world responding to different elements. 
When the film received its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado on September 1, audiences laughed at the political satire, while viewers in South Korea responded to the ""story of family,"" Dorji added. 
But the response in his homeland was the most powerful, he admits. 
""When the film went to Bhutan, it was really beautiful because I had a cinema where all the audience was crying and becoming emotional because they connected in a very personal, intimate way in the loss of innocence because they lived through that period of change and transition."" 
""The Monk and the Gun"" is Bhutan's submission to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the 96th Academy Awards for the Best International Feature Film. A total of 89 titles are on the initial list, with the academy to announce the 15-film shortlist on December 21. The official nominations will be unveiled on January 23, 2024, ahead of the March 10 Oscars ceremony.
Variety magazine has ranked ""The Monk and the Gun"" as a ""top-tier possibility"" for the award. 
Bhutan has only previously submitted two films for consideration for an Oscar, ""The Cup,"" in 1999, by Dorji's film-making mentor and spiritual teacher Khyentse Norbu, and Dorji's own directorial debut, ""Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom,"" in 2021.  
""Lunana"" — the heartwarming tale of a teacher posted to the most remote village in Bhutan — made history when it became the first Bhutanese film to be nominated for an Oscar. 
""Lunana is a story about finding home, where you belong,"" he said. ""It is a very diverse film, it is of a culture that many people do not know of, it is set in a country that many people do not know of, it is in a language that many people have never heard of. When I submitted it to the Oscars, they did not even recognize 'Dzongkha,' my national language. The country of Bhutan was not even on the Oscars list."" 
After winning stunning reviews and multiple film awards around the world, Dorji received the Heart Son of the Thunder Dragon, Bhutan's highest civilian award, from King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck.
Critical and commercial success enabled Dorji to focus on his second film and the challenges of a poor, developing country in the 21st century. 
""Yes, the movie focuses on the transition to democracy in Bhutan, but it is more about modernization,"" Dorji said of ""The Monk and the Gun."" ""What interests me is how Bhutanese culture reacts to that change."" 
""The gun in the movie represents the arrival of modernization. A gun is something Western and modern and yes, if you use it in the right way, it can be very beneficial. But it is also very dangerous.""
Dorji instructed his actors to be bemused by the weapon; to hold it upside down, look down the barrel, because he wanted to portray their innocence in the face of change. And the gun is counterpointed by a large wooden phallus, a traditional symbol in Bhutan that the film used to portray tradition, culture and innocence. 
Dorji insists he has not thought about winning the Oscar in Los Angeles next year but is focused on ""sharing Bhutan's culture with the rest of the world."" 
""We are a culture that is based on the Buddha's teaching of love, compassion, wisdom and kindness and I want to use films to share that with the rest of the world,"" he said. ""But I also want to make films based on these values to keep our traditions relevant and alive for local Bhutanese.""

Fighters from a paramilitary force that has been battling the army for eight months advanced into the city of Wad Madani, the capital of the El Gezira state. They also seized the town of Rufaa, witnesses said.
The takeover of Wad Madani, a city packed with displaced people and an aid hub during the current conflict, could be a turning point in the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces' (RSF) advance through western and central regions of Sudan.
The city lies about 170 kilometers (105 miles) southeast of the capital Khartoum and is an important agricultural region in a country facing worsening hunger.
At least 250,000 to 300,000 people had fled El Gezira since the eruption of clashes four days ago, the IOM said in a statement.
""Fleeing again will completely deplete our resources,"" Heba Abdelrahim, who had come to Wad Madani with her family from Khartoum, told Reuters. ""Thinking logically we will wait until we don't have any other choice.""
Videos posted by the RSF showed fighters in pick-up trucks driving along streets in Wad Madani and over a bridge across the Blue Nile that it had been fighting over with the army. Witnesses said they also raided nearby villages.
In one video, RSF fighters carrying rifles stood with their arms around Coptic priests, who said they had not been able to flee but asked the RSF for help leaving the city.
The videos were not verified. There army did not comment.
Local pro-democracy activists said the RSF had set up checkpoints throughout the city and were looting homes and cars, with no army or police present.
The RSF and the army had shared power with civilians after the 2019 overthrow of former strongman Omar al-Bashir before staging a coup together in 2021 then coming to blows over an internationally backed political transition plan.
The UN Security Council ended its political mission in Sudan earlier this month. 
Since fighting broke out on April 15 between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his former deputy, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, Wad Madani became a haven for thousands of displaced people during the conflict.
The war between the army and the RSF has forced more than seven million people to flee their homes, left the capital in ruins, caused a humanitarian crisis and triggered waves of ethnically driven killings in Darfur.
In Khartoum, the RSF has been accused of looting homes, raping women, and arbitrary killings and detentions.

https://www.dw.com/en/serbian-snap-election-majority-backs-vucics-populist-party/a-67760467,POLITICS,Serbian snap election: Majority backs Vucic's populist party 18.12.2023,"Filip Svarm, editor-in-chief of the prestigious Serbian weekly magazine Vreme, is frustrated with the results of Serbia's snap parliamentary election. He already knows what will come next, he told DW: another bout of ""unbridled power for the SNS.""
Aleksandar Vucic's ruling Serbian Progressive Party won 47% of the ballots, enough to secure a comfortable majority for the coming years. It was already steering the country practically unopposed before the snap election.
The pro-European opposition alliance Serbia Against Violence (SPN), consisting of 15 parties that range from center-right to green to left, came in second with about 23% of the popular vote. But for political scientist Dusan Milenkovic, these results are not bad.
He said the conservative and democratic parties had always struggled to get a foothold in Serbia. Thus, these results were actually some of the best in the history of Serbia's multiparty system.
The coalition emerged in response to massive anti-government protests triggered by two deadly mass shootings earlier this year. It was the protests and increasingly tense relations with Kosovo that inspired Vucic to call a snap election two years ahead of schedule.
As expected, election observers and non-governmental organizations have flagged several concerns regarding vote rigging. Some 40,000 external voters were allegedly brought to Belgrade and other Serbian cities to vote for SNS using forged IDs.
Most of them are said to have come in organized bus transports from Republika Srpska, a Serb-majority entity in neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina. While these voters might be ethnic Serbs, they are formally Bosnian nationals and, therefore, do not have the right to participate in Serbian elections. The opposition filed a complaint and called for protests the day after the election.
""Serbia has voted, but the OSCE has reported abuse of public funds, intimidation of voters, and cases of vote buying,"" the German foreign ministry said in a post on social media platform X, referring to accusations by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. ""That is unacceptable for a country with EU candidate status.""
The landslide victory of the SNS is primarily thanks to Vucic himself. The populist ruler, denounced by critics as an autocrat, did not stand for elections but dominated the campaign . The SNS list campaigned with ""Aleksandar Vucic — Serbia must not stand still."" According to a poll by the Serbian election observation mission CRTA, one out of four Serbian citizens thought that Vucic himself was running for elections, and 60% believed that he was his party's lead candidate.
There are several reasons why Vucic has such an undisputed grip on Serbian politics. The ""Vucic system"" benefits from the fact that about 10% of the adult population — in a country with a population of 6.8 million — are SNS members. Vucic is known to reward party membership and votes with jobs and cash handouts.
Domestically, Vucic has boosted his popularity by stirring nationalist sentiments regarding Kosovo. He tells Serbian nationalists precisely what they want to hear: ""Kosovo must remain Serbian."" It's a potential flashpoint that has concerned the European Union for years.
Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, which has since been recognized by the United States and most members of the EU. Serbia, Russia and several other European nations do not acknowledge the Republic of Kosovo.
Serbia's most recent EU accession progress report was not too rosy. Not least, presumably, because Serbian strongman Vucic prefers to take an anti-Western stance while expressing a pro-Russian sentiment popular with large parts of the population. Nevertheless, experts say Vucic, who served as information minister under Slobodan Milosevic, is seen as a potential guarantor for stability and, therefore, handled with kid gloves.

The fact that Vucic has been tending to friendly Russo-Serbian ties has long been a thorn in the EU's side. But that hasn't stopped the bloc from repeatedly offering the Balkan state support. It's a risky business, says Rade Basta, Serbia's former minister of economy. On Sunday, Germany's most popular tabloid newspaper, Bild, quoted him as saying that Russia was reaching for influence in the Western Balkans in order to destabilize the EU. According to him, Russian President Putin was an indirect party to any negotiation that Vucic held with Brussels. Therefore, he recommended that Brussels accept the Western Balkan nations into the EU as quickly as possible to thwart Moscow's influence in the region.
Often referred to as the Western Balkans, Serbia, Kosovo, Albania, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina have expressed their desire to join the EU for many years. All but Kosovo have been granted official candidate status.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-farmers-blockade-berlin-in-tractor-protest/a-67757792,POLITICS,Germany: Farmers blockade Berlin in tractor protest 18.12.2023,"Farmers from across Germany descended upon Berlin on Monday, with hundreds of tractors converging on the city's famous Brandenburg Gate under the motto, ""Too much is too much!""
Farmers are angry about the federal government's decision to scrap diesel fuel subsidies as well as the negation of tax breaks for the purchase of agricultural and forestry machinery.
According to the German Farmers' Association, those changes could cost farmers up to €1 billion (roughly $1.1 billion).
The coalition government has justified the move by pointing to the need to plug a €17 billion hole in the country's 2024 budget after the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe ruled it was unconstitutional for Berlin to reallocate funds originally earmarked for coronavirus aid for other purposes.
Berlin said the court's decision had made it imperative to cut climate-damaging subsidies.
Green Party Agriculture Minister Cem Özdemir was among those criticizing the government's approach, saying farmers have ""no alternative"" to diesel, adding ""farmers are the ones who supply us with food, these cuts overburden the sector.""
Finance Minister Christian Lindner as well as Economy Minister Robert Habeck have both signaled a willingness to hear out farmers but claim they have little room to maneuver after the Karlsruhe ruling.
Farmers are now seeking to send a ""first clear signal"" to Berlin's three-party governing coalition that it needs to drop the planned cuts.
Farmers' Association President Joachim Rukwied said, ""if not, there will be massive resistance from January. We will not put up with this.""
Habeck said anyone seeking to reverse cuts was obliged to present an acceptable means of financing them.
Although agricultural earnings had been on the rise, falling grain, oilseed and milk prices have all begun to eat into profit margins.

https://www.dw.com/en/calls-in-us-for-nato-like-alliance-in-indo-pacific/a-67757049,POLITICS,Calls in US for NATO-like alliance in Indo-Pacific 18.12.2023,"A group of conservative US politicians has proposed a bill to Congress that would establish a fact-finding panel as the first step in the creation of an Indo-Pacific version of NATO that could act as a deterrent against growing aggression in the region by China and North Korea.    
While there are many who agree the proposal could bring together like-minded nations in a military alliance, the broader sense is that the proposal is doomed to fail.
The Indo-Pacific Treaty Organization Act was submitted by Republican Rep. Mike Lawler of New York. ""Our adversaries — China, Russia, Iran and North Korea — have forged an unholy alliance to disrupt and destabilize the globe,"" he said in a statement released by his office in early December.
""A collective security agreement has the potential to deter aggression and protect the forces of democracy in the Indo-Pacific,"" the statement added. ""It is crucial that the democracies of the region and the world work in unison to combat this rising threat.""
Recent events would seem to support Lawler's suggestion that there are growing challenges to peace and stability in the western Pacific, with China continuing its campaign of pressure on Taiwan ahead of the island's elections on January 13, and deploying naval assets to deter the Philippines navy from resupplying troops on an islet in the South China Sea that Beijing claims as its own.

On December 14, South Korea scrambled fighters when two Chinese and four Russian military aircraft entered its Air Defense Identification Zone without warning. Japan also deployed air units over the Sea of Japan.  
On Monday, North Korea fired a long-range ballistic missilefrom a mobile launcher outside Pyongyang, with the weapon flying on a lofted trajectory before landing in the Sea of Japan, about 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) away.  
The missile was the fifth long-range missile that North Korea has launched so far this year, and the launch came one day after the North fired a short-range weapon that flew for a distance of 570 kilometers before splashing down. Immediately after the launch, the North Korean Defense Ministry condemned Washington's deployment of forces in the region and claimed recent talks between South Korea and the US were ""an open declaration on nuclear confrontation.""
But despite the many and varied threats to the stability of the region, analysts say there is very little likelihood that nations of the Indo-Pacific will come together in a local version of NATO.  
""There has been talk of this sort of thing at times since the Cold War, but I do not think it will go much beyond an idea,"" said Ryo Hinata-Yamaguchi, an assistant professor of international relations at the University of Tokyo.
""For one thing, there is a lack of trust among many of the governments in the region, even if we leave China and North Korea out, while other nations just do not see the need for a formalized institution like NATO here,"" he told DW.
""As an institution, NATO may look good, but it took decades to build to the level it is at today. It is very political and just as bureaucratic,"" he pointed out. ""To many Asian nations, the hub-and-spoke approach to alliances looks much more appealing because it is flexible."" 

There are numerous examples of bilateral or small-scale alliances across the region, he said, whether for economic or security reasons.
The Association of South East Asian Nations is a political and economic union of 10 states, for example, while Japan, South Korea and the US are about to complete a pact that will enable them to rapidly share information if North Korea launches a missile.
AUKUS focuses the attention of the US, Britain and Australia on security issues in the region, while the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, is similarly designed to bring together the US, Australia, India and Japan.  
Bilaterally, Japan recently signed an agreement to provide coastal patrol craft to both Malaysia and the Philippines, two nations that are in dispute with Beijing as it attempts to expand its area of control in the South China Sea, Hinata-Yamaguchi pointed out.  
Stephen Nagy, a professor of international relations at Tokyo's International Christian University, said there was at present little likelihood of the many disparate nations of the region shaking off their political differences to such a point that they could become a bloc of comparable power to NATO.
""But that will be decided by China because if Beijing decides to become significantly more aggressive in the region, then anything could happen,"" he cautioned.
As things stand, however, China is using carrots as much as sticks to win over regional governments, with Chinese President Xi Jinping going to Hanoi for two days of talks with his Vietnamese counterpart Vo Vun Thuong from December 12. The discussions went ahead despite the two nations being at loggerheads over disputed islands in the South China Sea.

""Many countries in the region are delicately positioned between China and the US and many prefer to build multi-polar alliances instead of allying with Washington or Beijing,"" he said.
The trend, Nagy said, is towards ""mini-lateralism"" over multilateralism, with small groups of three or four nations that are aligned on a narrow issue cooperating towards that aim.
For others, however, an Indo-Pacific alliance along the lines of NATO would be the best solution to growing threats.
""I fully support the idea, although I realize it would be extremely difficult to create and operate such a security mechanism,"" said Yoichi Shimada, a professor of politics and international relations at Fukui Prefectural University.
""I think it would have the support of many smaller states in the region that are weaker individually but stronger together with their neighbors, such as the Philippines,"" he said. ""And I do believe the foundations of such an organization are already in place. I see the Quad as being the basis of a regional alliance, and I hope that in the years to come, it welcomes more nations as partners.""

https://www.dw.com/en/egypts-el-sissi-wins-third-term-in-presidential-election/a-67756968,POLITICS,Egypt's el-Sissi wins third term in presidential election 18.12.2023,"Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi has secured a third term in office, the National Election Authority said on Monday.
Sissi received 89.6% of the vote. He ran against three other candidates.
The election was held over three days between December 10 and 12.
The authority put turnout in last week's presidential election at around 66.8%. The previous election, held in 2018, had a registered turnout of 41%.
National Election Authority head Hazem Badawy called the level of voter participation in this year's election ""unprecedented.""
""The voting percentage is the highest in the history of Egypt,"" he said.
The leader of the Republican People's Party, Hazem Omar, received 4.5% of the vote.
Farid Yahran of the center-left Egyptian Social Democratic Party came in third place, and Abdel-Sana Yamama of the liberal Wafd party came fourth.
The former military leader was first elected president in 2014, after ousting and outlawing the Muslim Brotherhood that led the previous government, and was handed a second term in 2018. In both elections he garnered 97% of the vote.
Egypt's constitution limits presidents from serving more than three terms in office. The duration of terms was adjusted from four to six years by a 2019 constitutional amendment, meaning el-Sissi is likely to rule until 2030.
The incumbent's victory was widely regarded as a foregone conclusion, as his three opponents were largely marginal political figures.
El-Sissi's most prominent challenger, Ahmed Tantawy, halted his campaign in October, saying that officials and thugs targeted his supporters. The National Election Authority dismissed the accusations.
In his election campaign, el-Sissi pledged to address the country's economy, which has been grappling with a major crisis. His government initiated an International Monetary Fund-backed reform program in 2016, but the austerity measures led to a steep increase in prices.

https://www.dw.com/en/hong-kong-china-anxious-as-world-watches-jimmy-lai-trial/a-67753307,POLITICS,Hong Kong: China 'anxious' as world watches Jimmy Lai trial 18.12.2023,"The long-awaited trial of Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai began on Monday morning, with a significant police presence deployed outside the courthouse.
Dozens of people queued up for the hearing; some had even arrived before dawn. They were here to see the 76-year-old defendant who was arrested in August 2020 under a sweeping national security law imposed on Hong Kong by Beijing the same year.
Initially scheduled to start more than a year ago, the trial has been postponed several times. 
As the founder of Apple Daily — a popular news outlet critical of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) — Lai was charged with conspiring to collude with foreign forces and publish seditious material.
His son Sebastien Lai, who has been traveling the world to seek international support, regards the trial as a ""show"" for Beijing to silence dissidents. ""This is clearly a means to put the whole of Hong Kong in fear, so that you will no longer speak out for democracy and be afraid of criticizing the government,"" he told DW.

The trial, which was expected to begin without a jury, could last up to 80 days. Lai faces a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Given his advanced age, even short sentences in jail pose a great risk to his health, ""I am worried that my dad will pass away (in prison),"" Sebastien Lai said.
His father has already been behind bars for over three years. A request for bail was denied and the initial plan to hire a British lawyer, Timothy Owen, also failed after Beijing's intervention. On December 30 of last year, China gave Chief Executive of Hong Kong John Lee the power to bar foreign lawyers, such as Owen, from cases related to national security.
In late 2021, Lai received a 13-month jail term for charges of involvement in a banned vigil for the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Last year, on a separate count, he was found guilty of fraud and sentenced to five years and nine months in prison.
""The [Chinese] government has tried every effort to keep him out of the public scene,"" Eric Lai, a research fellow at Center for Asian Law of Georgetown University (GCAL), told DW.
The media mogul was known as one of the CCP's most outspoken critics. Apple Daily — before being raided by the police and subsequently shut down in 2021 — was particularly vocal about the territory's pro-democracy movement.
His arrest was part of the sweeping crackdown on press freedom and civil liberties in Hong Kong following the 2019 pro-democracy protests, which were sparked by the government's decision to introduce a bill to facilitate the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China.

Ahead of the trial, calls for the immediate release of Jimmy Lai grew stronger, from human rights groups to foreign governments.
Just one day before the trial began, the United Kingdom and the United States both urged the Chinese authorities to end their prosecution and release Lai. Earlier, the Canadian parliament had also released a ""unanimous"" motion calling for his release, following a similar demand made by the European Parliament.
Of all the international support, the UK's statement is considered particularly critical as Lai holds British citizenship. Last week, Sebastien Lai met British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, who promised that London would ""stand by Jimmy Lai and the people of HK,"" according to an official post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
In response, the Chinese embassy in London strongly criticized the meeting, claiming it had ""further exposed Jimmy Lai's long-term collusion with the UK side.""
The significant public attention on the case appears to have made the Chinese authorities uneasy, analyst Eric Lai said.
On Friday, Hong Kong police released a new bounty list of five overseas activists accused of violating the national security law. At the same time, the Hong Kong Security Bureau announced strict guidelines for visitors entering the court and said that inspections would include X-ray checks.
Announcing a bounty list can be a way to divert international attention, Lai from GCAL said: ""All these tactics by the government reflect they are very anxious [about] Jimmy Lai's popularity.""

Lai's trial, which is expected to be the first where a defendant pleads not guilty for ""colluding with foreign forces,"" is believed to be an example of how the national security law has fundamentally changed criminal proceedings in Hong Kong.
In addition to being denied access to an overseas lawyer and bail, Lai will also face judges handpicked by Hong Kong Chief Executive  John Lee. Eric Lai also said that some of the witnesses were ""tainted"" given the fact that they were defendants themselves and had been in pre-trial detention for more than two years.
""This will, of course, create a high level of stress on them [witnesses],"" he said, highlighting that these conditions could make a trial ""more unfair than before.""
Since Lai's case is ""highly politicized,"" the Hong Kong researcher suggested it would be worth noting whether authorities from the territory or Beijing would intervene, as they have done before, by interpreting basic laws in court.

Sebastien Lai feels ""torn"" about his father's decision to remain in Hong Kong before his arrest. ""He obviously loves Hong Kong,"" he told DW. ""He wants to stand beside Hong Kong people and defend freedom together with journalists.""
""I am incredibly proud that he's my father,"" he added. ""I will always keep campaigning for him.""

The deployment, intended to support Lithuania's security after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, will be the first time that Germany permanently stations troops outside its borders.

""We will and we are ready to defend NATO territory,"" Pistorius said in a press conference with his Lithuanian counterpart, Arvydas Anusauskas.
The two ministers stressed the commitment of their countries to ""defend each other and every centimeter of alliance territory at all times and to protect our freedom and democracy in accordance with Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.""
The Washington Treaty, the founding basis of NATO, stipulates in Article 5 that an armed attack on any member will be deemed an attack against all.
The Bundeswehr division will start to arrive in 2025 and is planned to reach full fighting readiness in 2027, Anusauskas said.
The aim is to station 4,800 troops and around 200 civilians permanently in Lithuania in coordination with NATO.
Berlin will deploy two combat troop battalions from the German states of Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia to form the core of the new Lithuania brigade.

A third battalion will be a multinational NATO battle unit as part of the alliance's Enhanced Forward Presence force.
A battalion is already in Lithuania, under German command, with rotating personnel from several other nations.
Lithuania has a border with the Russian Baltic Sea exclave of Kaliningrad and Moscow's close ally Belarus.
Western military analysts in the West have long viewed the Suwalki Gap, the part of Lithuania's territory lying between the two, as a potential flashpoint area in any standoff between Russia and NATO.

https://www.dw.com/en/baerbock-visits-rwanda-as-africas-first-mrna-factory-opens/a-67753328,POLITICS,Baerbock visits Rwanda as Africa's first mRNA factory opens 18.12.2023,"German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbockhas praised Euro-African cooperation on vaccine production and promised Africa the full support of Germany and the European Union when fighting future pandemics and other diseases.
Her words came as German pharmaceutical firm BioNTech prepared to open an EU-backed mRNA vaccine plant in Kigali, Rwanda, to help supply the continent when future pandemics such as COVID-19 arise.
""At a time when we're talking about deepening divides in global politics, we are showing what Euro-African cooperation can achieve,"" Baerbock said at the official unveiling of part of the new factory in the Rwandan capital.
She called the event a key ""milestone"" and said she hoped the plant would form ""the core of a Rwandan pharmaceutical industry which will will supply the African market at affordable prices.""
Acknowledging that Europe and the rest of the world did not act quickly or decisively enough to deliver vaccines to Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Green Party politician said:
""We can't undo the mistakes of the past but together we can learn and build a better future. We can show that we can build a stronger global health system and overcome global crises together.""
Rwandan President Paul Kagame said he was ""proud"" that his country was the location for the new factory, insisting that the quality of vaccines produced there will be ""just as good as in other places.""
Prior to departure, Baerbock had reaffirmed that ""diseases do not recognize national borders or continents — our solidarity must not either"" and had underlined:
""Fair and rapid access to life-saving vaccines must not depend on whether a child is born in Germany or Rwanda.""
Only one in 100 vaccine doses administered in Africa is currently produced on the continent — a figure that African leaders hope could be 60 times higher by 2040.
""This is definitely an ambitious goal,"" said DW correspondent Thomas Sparrow, who's accompanying the foreign minister on her trip to Rwanda.
""It's not only about being better prepared for a future pandemic — it's also about helping to deal with public health issues that are very significant for Africa, such as malaria or tuberculosis,"" said Sparrow.
The Mainz-based company BioNTech plans to make mRNA-based vaccines for the continent at its plant in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, starting next year.
It aims to produce vaccines against malaria and tuberculosis. According to the WHO, 94% of the 249 million malaria cases in 2022 were registered in the continent. 
The EU's Global Gateway project will help pay for the enhanced vaccine capacity with €1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) by 2027 — of which some €550 million will come from Germany.

The same initiative also includes up to €300 billion of investment in the infrastructure of emerging and developing countries over the next few years.
Part of the aim is to secure more global influence for the EU, with the project intended to compete with China's ""New Silk Road"" project.
Baerbock was also due to Rwandan Foreign Minister Vincent Biruta in Kigali, where the pair were to visit a memorial to the victims of the genocide against the Tutsi.
In 1994, Hutu majority militias murdered at least 800,000 members of the Tutsi minority in Rwanda.
Under current President Paul Kagame, Rwanda has become a leader within Africa in many areas, including the fight against corruption, with economic growth well above the continental average.
However, there are criticisms about the persecution of opposition figures and journalists who are critical of the government.
A deal with the United Kingdom for Rwanda to accept migrants who have reached Britain by irregular means is also controversial.
The UK Supreme Court struck down the plan, deeming the country too unsafe.
After arriving in Kigali, Baerbock rejected calls for asylum procedures to be outsourced from Europe.
Baerbock said she was ""a bit surprised"" that some German conservatives had suggested a similar asylum policy based on the British model.

https://www.dw.com/en/iraq-holds-first-provincial-elections-in-a-decade/a-67752454,POLITICS,Iraq holds first provincial elections in a decade 18.12.2023,"People in Iraq headed to the polls on Monday in the first provincial council elections since 2013.The elections are being held under beefed-up security.
The Shiite Muslim alliance is likely to strengthen its power amid an ongoing boycott by populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who is the alliance's main political rival.
Polling is taking place in 15 provinces of Iraq, leaving out three that are autonomous Kurdistan regions.
Some 17 million people are eligible to cast their votes at a total of 7,166 polling stations set up across Iraq.
Polling began in Baghdad, Kirkuk and Basra at 7:00 a.m. local time (0400 GMT), as was broadcast by Iraqi state television. The polling will continue until 6:00 p.m. local time.
More than 6,000 candidates are running in the elections for just 285 seats in the provincial councils.
The elections are seen as an opportunity to redeem democracy in Iraq and pave the way for parliamentary elections scheduled for 2025. They also present a test for Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani's government, which was established over a year ago.
The elections are likely to cement the hold of the ruling Coordination Framework coalition, an Iran-aligned bloc that includes Shiite Islamist parties with factions of Hashed al-Shaabi.
The influential Shiite cleric al-Sadr has joined the opposition against the Shiite alliance and is boycotting the local elections.
A vocal critic of the United States and Iran, he said the elections will only help establish the dominance of a corrupt political class.
Many members of the Shiite alliance are running on several lists, with former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki forming his own list.
The top Sunni Muslim leaders in the country, ousted parliament speaker Mohammed Halbousi and business mogul Khamees Khanjar, are running together.

https://www.dw.com/en/covid-19-makes-wintertime-comeback-in-germany/a-67753001,SOCIETY,COVID-19 makes wintertime comeback in Germany 18.12.2023,"COVID-19 has lost much of its fearsome reputation. Most people in Germany are vaccinated or have otherwise built up a baseline immunity. Still, general practitioners like Lars Rettstadt are busy.
""It's typical infection season again. There's a lot of sniffling and coughing,"" said the doctor in Dortmund, a city in western Germany. ""When we open the door on Monday morning, there are 70 people without an appointment: men, women, young and old.""
By his estimate, 80% of them have viral infections of some kind. Half of those are COVID-19.
Without a mask mandate, most patients don't wear one. Rettstadt's practice offers them for 50 cents. He has set aside an hour just for infection appointments, and patients can also reach him by video. PCR tests are reserved for those in particularly bad shape.
""We no longer see severe cases,"" he said, adding just one patient, aged 94, had to be hospitalized due to COVID-19. 
Otherwise, symptoms reflect the regular wintry kind that keep people out of work to recover in bed at home. Yet sick days can go for as long as two weeks.
While the illness might not be fatal, it is causing massive disruptions. As much as 10% of the country sick, according to Germany's Robert Koch Institute for public health, and offices and services are struggling to stay open. And with the mix-and-mingle Christmas season coming up, Health Minister Karl Lauterbach has urged people to get their vaccinations topped up.
The official, seven-day incidence is at 38, which seems low in comparison to 2,000 during the omicron wave in early 2022. Yet with testing sporadic, that number may be deceiving. A recent test of wastewater has shown more COVID-19 in the water since this form of testing was first started in June 2022.

Other forms of PCR testing suggest a seven-day incidence of almost 3,900 in the western German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, said the Frankfurt-based virologist Martin Stürmer. That's up from 2,600 one week ago.
""We are in a phase where the coronavirus figures are increasing massively,"" he added.
The coronavirus figures are in addition to the usual cases of flu and respiratory illnesses. Yet these haven't translated into a higher burden on hospitals and ICU wards, said Stürmer. The death rate has also remained stable.
Of the many variants out there now, the ""JN.1 subvariant, another successor variant of pirola, is now responsible for almost a third of cases,"" he added. 
While the risk to the general population is low, Stürmer called on at-risk groups, including people over the age of 60, to get booster shots. These add a layer of defense against so-called long COVID, the long-term effects of COVID-19. Masks could be sensible, too, he added, although there is little public desire to go back to them.
""The willingness to be vaccinated is also certainly at a low level,"" said Stürmer. ""I think these are all factors that we could significantly improve with positive and meaningful communication.""

https://www.dw.com/en/hong-kong-jimmy-lai-foreign-collusion-trial-starts/a-67752378,POLITICS,Hong Kong: Jimmy Lai foreign 'collusion' trial starts 18.12.2023,"Hong Kong businessman Jimmy Lai went on trial on Monday on national security charges.
He is accused by Beijing of ""collusion"" with foreign forces and could face life in prison if convicted. China passed a new national security law in 2020, which tightened its control over Hong Kong and cracked down on civil liberties.

Lai is the founder of the Apple Daily tabloid, which has been critical of Beijing. The newspaper was subject to a police raid in 2020 and was forced to close in 2021.
Lai has already been convicted in five other cases, including for organizing and participating in pro-democracy protest marches in 2019 and for a fraud conviction over a lease dispute for his newspaper.
Several other charges have been brought against him, including ""conspiracy to publish seditious material.""
Lai's lawyer, Robert Pang, argued that the charge should be thrown out because Hong Kong's criminal law imposes a time limit for such prosecutions.
""[Prosecutors] are out of time. Therefore, there is no jurisdiction of the court,"" he said.

British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said that he was ""particularly concerned"" at what he called the ""politically motivated persecution"" of Lai and called for his release.
""As a prominent and outspoken ... publisher, Jimmy Lai has been targeted in a clear attempt to stop the peaceful exercise of his rights to freedom of expression and association,"" Cameron said.
""I call on the Hong Kong authorities to end their prosecution and release Jimmy Lai,"" he said.
US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller also called for the businessman's release.
""Actions that stifle press freedom ... have undermined Hong Kong's democratic institutions,"" Miller said.
In reaction to the statements, Beijing accused London and Washington of violating the ""spirit of the rule of law.""
 ""The United States and United Kingdom's remarks on the case ... are in serious violation of the spirit of the rule of law, and ... they constitute blatant political maneuvering and are a complete (example of) double standards,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a regular press briefing.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-far-right-afd-wins-first-city-mayoral-election/a-67750487,POLITICS,Germany: Far-right AfD wins first city mayoral election 17.12.2023,"A candidate from Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party won a city mayoral election for the first time on Sunday. 
Tim Lochner was elected after winning the second round of voting in Pirna, a town in the eastern state of Saxony where the AfD has been notably strong.
Initial results showed that Lochner had won 38.5% of the vote, the city stated on its website.
The far-right candidate beat out Kathrin Dollinger-Knuth (CDU), who came second with 31.4% of the vote, and Ralf Thiele, from the small Free Voters party, who got 30.1%.
Lochner, 53, is an independent but decided to stand under the far-right AfD banner for the vote.
In the first round Lochner secured a third of the vote, but was able to increase his share in the second round. The local Greens and Social Democrats dropped out after the first round and threw their support behind the CDU's Dollinger-Knuth.
Situated 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) southeast of Dresden on the edge of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains, Pirna has around 40,000 inhabitants. The town is known above all for its almost perfectly preserved old town.
Sunday's result comes just days after the eastern state of Saxony's domestic intelligence agency deemed the AfD as a right-wing extremist party.
Pirna marks the first time the AfD has won a mayorship in a town. In August, Hannes Loth was elected as the first mayor of a municipality — Raguhn-Jeßnitz in the state of Saxony-Anhalt — but this was a region with just 9,000 inhabitants.
In June, the party won its first district council election, with candidate Robert Sesselmann in the Sonneberg district in Thuringia.
The far-right party has been on the rise in Germany with surveys showing around one in five voters saying they would vote AfD, making it the second most popular party after the CDU.
In the eastern German states, the share of voters willing to vote AfD stands at over 30% — ahead of all other parties — with three of those states scheduled to hold elections next year: Thuringia, Saxony and Brandenburg.
Earlier this month, Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany's main opposition Christian Democrats (CDU), rowed back from comments suggesting his party was open to working with the AfD at the municipal level.

https://www.dw.com/en/chad-holds-divisive-post-coup-constitutional-referendum/a-67702189,POLITICS,Chad holds divisive post-coup constitutional referendum 17.12.2023,"About 8 million registered voters headed to the polls on Sunday to cast their ballots on whether Chad should adopt a new constitution.
The ""yes"" vote was endorsed by a broad alliance of parties, including the military-led transitional government headed by General Mahamat Deby, the former ruling Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS) and the main opposition UNDR party of Prime Minister Saleh Kebzabo.
During the 20 days of campaigning, the ""yes"" camp held large meetings throughout the vast country in the Sahel region, including a massive kickoff event in the capital, N'Djamena.
""The 'yes' camp has a strong hold on all the public resources and holds political power in terms of mobilizing people,"" said Remadji Hoinathy, a Chad-based senior researcher for the Institute for Security Studies, a pan-African think tank.
""It's also the camp that controls the media,"" Hoinathy told DW.
In contrast, the ""no"" camp, which includes opposition parties and some civil society organizations, is short on finances and faces intimidation from security forces who have broken up rallies and seized flyers. Several opposition parties have called for a boycott of the referendum.
The lead-up to the vote was also marred by a lack of transparency around voting registration and auditing. Because of these factors, many analysts believe the ""yes"" vote will win.
""The 'yes' vote actually has all the means, including illegal means, to win,"" said Hoinathy. ""But if the 'yes' won, that would not mean that there had been a free referendum.""
Washington-based Africa security expert Cameron Hudson put it more bluntly: ""The referendum's outcome is already a foregone conclusion,"" he told DW.
Those opposed to the new constitution are concerned the referendum has ignored the unresolved question of whether the desperately impoverished nation should become a federal state or stay centrally governed.
Chad has had a central, or unitary, government since gaining independence from France in 1960. The central structure is enshrined in the proposed constitution.
""No"" campaigners, however, favor a transition to a federal state. They argue that a central government has failed to develop Chad, the world's second poorest nation.

Those who defend staying with the central state say federalism would further fragment the country, whose regions are marked by strong religious, ethnic and tribal divisions.
The junta led by Mahamat Deby, who assumed power in April 2021 following the death of his father, President Idriss Deby, has set out a road map to transition back to civilian rule.
One of the three pillars of this transition was an inclusive national dialogue meant to tackle issues such as constitutional reform and other political topics dividing the country.
Held from April to October 2022, the national dialogue recommended first holding a referendum to settle the debate on which form the state should take — either a federal or central system — and then drafting a new constitution based on the outcome.
But Sunday's referendum failed to ask Chadians which form of government they would prefer.
In a survey published at the beginning of the year by the Network of Chadian Journalists and Reporters, more than two out of three Chadians, or 71%, were in favor of moving to a federal system.
In regional dialogues that preceded the national dialogue, 10 out of 23 provinces wanted to opt for federalism, according to political expert Hoinathy.
Africa's fifth biggest nation by area, Chad is home to some 200 ethnic groups. The semi-desert region in the north is populated primarily by nomadic and semi-nomadic Muslims. The semi-tropical southern part of the country, where there is large-scale farming, is predominantly Christian and animist.
""Most of Chad's regions are demanding a greater degree of federalism, which gives more local authority and autonomy to the various groups that dominate in those areas, like you have in Nigeria, for example,"" said Hudson, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies Africa, a Washington-based think tank.
The regions see the federal system working reasonably well in Nigeria, Chad's neighbor to the south, and now they want to adopt the same system, he told DW.
Some of those lobbying for the central system have accused the federalists of wanting to completely dissolve Chad as a country. But Chad expert Helga Dickow, a political scientist at Germany's University of Freiburg, doesn't believe this is true.
""They just want to have their fair share in politics and resources. They don't want it to be dominated by a small ethnic group,"" she said, referring to the Zaghawa, a minority ethnic group from the country's northeast.
The Zaghawa have dominated Chad's politics and armed forces since Idriss Deby, a member of the Zaghawa clan, took power in a coup in 1990, ruling until his death on the battlefield in 2021.
Transitional President Deby is consolidating his grip on power, most analysts have said, by avoiding a referendum on federalism and enshrining a unitary government in the constitution.
""If you are a dictator,"" said Hudson, ""the federal system doesn't really serve your interests particularly well ... It would be a devolution of power, and that's something that [the transitional government is] resisting.
""That's why the government has been pushing for the unitary state.""
Chad expert Dickow, who spent two months conducting research in the country earlier this year, shares a similar opinion.
""It's clear that the transitional government aims to guard the power in its hand by [keeping the central state],"" she said. A central system also benefits the security forces by allowing them to keep control, she added.
On the death of Idriss Deby, Chad's military government promised a transition to democracy that included the national dialogue, constitutional reform and elections by October 2022.
The results of the national dialogue were widely seen as disappointing, the referendum turned out to be contentious, and elections were delayed by two years until October 2024.
""Unfortunately, there is the impression that this transition is not really a transition to anything new,"" said Hoinathy. ""We are seeing the reification of the Deby system, maybe in a worse form to come.""

https://www.dw.com/en/russias-influence-overshadows-serbias-election/a-67744235,POLITICS,Russia's influence overshadows Serbia's election 16.12.2023,"The Serbian politician and diplomat Vladimir Krsljanin, 63, has been one of the most prominent advocates of close cooperation between Serbia and Russia for decades. He was a high-ranking official in the Serbian Socialist Party of Slobodan Milosevic, in whose defense he made a name for himself at the war crimes trial at The Hague.
In a book whose title translates as ""The New World. Serbia, Russia, China — the future has begun"" that he presented in Belgrade earlier this month, Krsljanin sketches a view of the world that has found sympathy in large swaths of the Serbian population. It includes lines such as: ""Like Christ, Russia is conducting a war to save the world"" and ""The only two possibilities are Russia's victory or the annihilation of humanity.""
Such theses can be found on a daily basis in Serbia's pro-Russian media outlets. The Kremlin-controlled Sputnik Serbia and RT Balkan, which both have offices in Belgrade that they use to broadcast to Serbia's neighbors, are powerful engines of the propaganda machine. Many Serbian outlets use their ""information,"" which often goes unchecked.
The recent opening of a new natural gas pipeline from Bulgaria to Serbia gives an indication of the impact of the misinformation. The pipeline will give access to gas from Azerbaijan from next year, and Serbia, which has EU candidate status, received €75 million ($82 million) from the bloc to contribute to the €85 million in construction costs. Some €50 million were a donation, the rest consisted of low-interest loans.
But this information was barely reported in the Serbian media, with state broadcaster RTS even claiming that the gas was coming from Russia. In pictures of the opening ceremony in the press, the EU representative was hidden behind by Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.
Russia is doing everything to keep Serbia close, with both the Kremlin and the state-controlled media going all out for Vucic. A recent article maligning the governing party's political rivals in the Belgrade newspaper Informer, often called the president's ""megaphone,"" read: ""Foreign embassies and [the US investor and philanthropist George] Soros are behind the lying opposition."" This was supported by claims that Russia Today had uncovered the information.

And in its latest edition, the right-wing nationalist weekly magazine Pecat published a portrait of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, citing him as saying: ""I am worried about the Serbs.""
It isn't new for Serbian media outlets to invoke the Serbian-Russian military brotherhood in the 20th century's two world wars.
Russia's ambassador to Serbia, Alexander Bozan-Kharchenko, is a frequent guest in Serbian media and often argues that the West is acting in Ukraine as it did in Kosovo.
Both the Russian and Serbian media have presented the Kosovo ""card"" as the ace in their sleeve, claiming that in the UN Security Council Russia, and China, are the guarantors that Serbia can continue to lay claim to Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008 and has a largely ethnic Albanian population. The argument is that ""the West"" wants to ensure that this separation of a once Serbian province remains permanent.
Russia presents itself as a ""real"" alternative to the West. ""The Western NATO masters are on the offensive and are ordering Serbia to go down on its knees and capitulate,"" wrote Sputnik Serbia recently. This claim was taken up in a variety of Serbian online media outlets.
Russian and Serbian media outlets frequently accuse Germany, in particular, of fomenting a coup in Serbia. When German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock recently criticized the nationalist tone of the Serbian election campaign, she was accused of ""gross interference."" She and other German politicians were accused of ""talking about a glorious EU future while dismembering the Serbian state,"" a comment made with reference to Kosovo.
Vucic, the top politician for the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) seems to have single-handedly shaped its election campaign, even though according to the constitution the president isn't allowed to get involved in party politics. He has made vows of allegiance to Russia as thanks for its support.
""I have fought to ensure that the friendship with Russia that we have developed over decades is not destroyed overnight,"" said Vucic recently, referring to his insistent refusal to impose sanctions on Russia despite his country's EU candidate status, pointing out that Russia is Serbia's ""traditional friend.""
Vucic has also used the Serbian media outlets under his control to repeatedly claim that Western states are financing the opposition to topple him. 
Paradoxically, though it's far from unacceptable in Serbia to be pro-Russia, both in real life and in the virtual world created and maintained by the media, the state actually has much closer ties with the West than with Russia. Serbia conducts two-thirds of its trade with the EU, the source of most foreign investment.
Moreover, few people would actually decide to go to Russia to study or find work. For many people, only the West offers a better future, particularly Austria and Germany.

The Interior Ministry of the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt accused the unnamed man of planning a ""serious act of violence."" He has been permanently banned from entering Germany.
German authorities said the suspect lived in Saxony-Anhalt but worked in Lower Saxony.
The police received a tip regarding the suspect, suggesting he was planning a ""serious attack"" on a Christmas market, media reported.
He was arrested in Lower Saxony on November 21.
The ministry said the deportation order was based on ""the prevention of a particular threat to the security of the Federal Republic of Germany or a terrorist threat.""
It was not clear whether any evidence confirming said plans was found.
German authorities have been on alert in recent months, citing an increased risk of terror attacks amid a reported global rise in antisemitism and Islamophobia on the backdrop of the ongoing conflict in Gaza.
Germany's Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) said last month that the danger of an Islamist terror attack on German soil had significantly increased.

The agency said the raised risk of attacks against the Jewish community or ""the West as a whole"" came in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attacks and Israel's subsequent military campaign in the Gaza Strip.
Germany's migrant communities of Arab origins are often the main suspects of such attacks.

State television interrupted regular programming with Quranic verses before making the announcement.
""With great sadness and sorrow, we mourn... the death of Sheikh Nawaf Al Ahmed Al Sabah, Emir of the State of Kuwait,"" said a statement.
International allies expressed condolences at news of the emir's death on Saturday. A statement from the White House said President Joe Biden was, ""saddened to learn of the passing of His Highness Amir Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of Kuwait."" 
The European Union released a similar statement.
Sheikh Nawaf only ruled Kuwait for three years. He was sworn in as the oil-rich country's emir in 2020, following the death of his predecessor, Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah.
Sheik Nawaf has been succeeded by his half-brother, 83-year-old Sheikh Meshal Al Ahmad Al Jaber, who had been the world's oldest crown prince before his naming by the Council of Ministers on Saturday afternoon.
The longtime leader of Kuwait's security services, Sheikh Meshal had been serving as the country's deputy ruler at the time of Sheikh Nawaf's death.
Prior to his short tenure as Kuwaiti ruler, Sheikh Nawaf held various strategic posts at some of the most critical moments in the country's history.
In 1990, for instance, when neighboring Iraq invaded Kuwait under Saddam Hussein, Sheikh Nawaf was defense minister.
In January 2005, when Kuwaiti security forces faced off against Islamist militants, Nawaf was interior minister.
The health of Kuwait's rulers is a sensitive matter that is rarely discussed publicly, this was no different when it came to Sheikh Nawaf.
In late November, he was rushed to hospital for an unspecified illness. He had previously traveled to the US for ""medical checks"" in March 2021, according to state-run news outlets.

https://www.dw.com/en/russian-billionaire-usmanov-german-justices-legal-dilemma/a-67740679,CORRUPTION,Russian billionaire Usmanov: German justice's legal dilemma 16.12.2023,"For more than 10 years, the Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov was able to enjoy the picturesque Bavarian Alps on the shore of Lake Tegernsee. Companies linked to Usmanov had purchased three properties there, including one that was apparently only for security people and other staff.
Everything changed with Russia's full-scale military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, after which Usmanov, a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch with particularly close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin,"" was added to the EU's sanctions list. There are currently several law enforcement agencies and departments investigating him, and various cases have been opened into companies and individuals with whom he is connected. He is suspected of money laundering, tax evasion and violating sanctions law. 
Hardly a month goes by without a report in the German media about searches or raids in connection with the oligarch. The yacht Dilbar, which was allegedly used by him until 2022, has been searched, as have the German premises of a Swiss bank where, according to reports in German media, he controlled accounts, and even the Munich office of his lawyers. This caused outrage at the German Federal Bar and was eventually contested successfully in the courts. The villa on Lake Tegernsee and other properties thought to be connected to the billionaire have been searched twice.
A dozen experienced lawyers work for Usmanov in Germany. They have challenged each step made by the investigators, including the searches, which they have described as a ""witch hunt"" that serves only ""to clearly demonstrate political determination to the public.""
In confidential conversations, the billionaire's team of lawyers has made no secret of its satisfaction with the first spectacular successes in court. In one case, Usmanov's defense team was able to deliver a slap to prosecutors in a court of appeal in October when a Frankfurt on Main judge confirmed a May decision that the search of the villa in which Usmanov had supposedly previously lived was illegal.
All of Germany's leading media outlets reported on the major search operation in the fall of 2022, which involved about 250 police officers. The search was prompted mainly by the suspicion of money laundering on the part of Usmanov.
Even in 1 1/2 years, prosecutors in Frankfurt haven't been able to collect enough evidence to convince the judges that the suspicion of money laundering is justified. Prosecutors answered DW's request for information by saying that the investigation was ongoing, also pointing to its confidentiality. 
DW was able to learn what evidence had been gathered in connection with Usmanov and money laundering after it received the texts of the court rulings regarding the legality of the searches of the properties on Lake Tegernsee. The first court decision of May 12, 2023, is based on 88 money transfers between 2017 and 2022 to German accounts controlled by Usmanov. To substantiate their suspicions that the money might be of criminal origin, investigators put before the court a printout of the English translation of a video made by the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny detailing how Usmanov allegedly evades the tax authorities in Russia by setting up shell companies for exports.
However, the judges did not discern any evidence that Russian laws had been violated or see a direct connection between tax evasion and concrete money transfers to Germany. Usmanov's German lawyers have not made a secret of their satisfaction, and in an informal conversation with DW, they said this case was ""practically a done deal.""

Frank Buckenhofer from the German Trade Union of the Police doesn't think the case could stand up in court. ""One would have to make a credible case that the money resulted from criminal activity,"" he said. ""If it all took place in Russia, then Putin would probably personally attest that he is the most honest person in the world.""
For 25 years, Buckenhofer has been one of the leading analysts in the fight against financial crime. He said that without close cooperation with law enforcement agencies in the country where the money originated, it was almost impossible to prove that laundering has taken place, adding that there was no such cooperation with Russia. 
While prosecutors seem to be plagued with a series of failures regarding the money laundering case, the investigation into assets attributed to Usmanov continues unabated. In October, on the initiative of the Central Office for the Enforcement of Sanctions (ZfS), some 30 officers from different law enforcement agencies conducted searches at properties on Lake Tegernsee.
Representatives of the ""Matryoshka"" commission that was specifically established to investigate Usmanov mainly confiscated expensive cars that the oligarch allegedly used until 2022. The reason for the confiscation was apparently information about the intention of the owner or his associates to sell the vehicles, which are subject to EU sanctions.   
Buckenhofer described the sensational pictures and videos of the raids as a ""show for the oligarchs"" and ""political theater."" He suggested the German authorities just wanted to show citizens that they are doing something against oligarchs, after decades of ignoring them and showing no interest in the origins of their money.
He also expressed doubt about the legal capabilities of the ZfS, which he said has not been granted the powers of a law enforcement agency.
""If the idea really had been to make life difficult for the oligarchs, then a more powerful financial police such as Italy's Guarda di Finanza would have been established. If that concept had been implemented, the message to all people who have illegal, hidden or sanctioned assets would have been: You cannot sleep soundly.""
German prosecutors haven't even been able to prove that the yacht Dilbar and the properties on Lake Tegernsee really belong to Usmanov, because they are registered as trusts via a chain of offshore companies. According to lawyers, part of the oligarch's German assets belongs to a trust in Bermuda via companies in different jurisdictions.
Usmanov's defense has claimed that he withdrew as a beneficiary of the trust in February 2022, just days before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which led to his being put on sanctions lists by the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
At first, the trust was registered anew in the name of Usmanov's sister, Gulbakhor Ismailova. When sanctions were imposed on her, too, in April 2022, she was also removed from the list of beneficiaries. It's not certain who currently owns the yacht and the properties that Usmanov used until 2022. His lawyers have refused to name the current beneficiary, even in confidence.
Buckenhofer said this situation showed how powerless the German law enforcement agencies were and that they would have to draw certain conclusions. ""It would be an important precondition that it should not be permissible to invest money into assets such as property if there is no chance for the German authorities to robustly ascertain the person with the financial responsibility, and if money is invested via companies in some kinds of banana republics or tax havens,"" he said.
Two further cases revolving around tax evasion and the violation of EU sanctions will depend on who the owner of the villa on Lake Tegernsee really is. Usmanov's lawyers claim their client isn't the owner, and never has been. They say he rented it from a trust he had set up but later left. If German prosecutors can prove in court that the villa does belong to Usmanov, that could turn him into a resident of Germany, possibly making him liable for hundreds of millions in taxes. 
If he isn't recognized as the owner, then the prosecutors will have to prove that he spent over 182 days per year in Germany. ""Germany was never his main domicile. He is a citizen of the world,"" one his lawyers told DW. According to reports in the media, real estate in Uzbekistan, Russia, Germany, France, Italy and the UK is thought to have been under Usmanov's control at different times.
If it can't be proven in court that Usmanov controls the real estate in Bavaria, the case regarding alleged violations of sanctions legislation could collapse.
""The accused is alleged to have continued using a security company to guard the properties in Upper Bavaria that can be ascribed to him after he was put on the EU's sanctions list. By paying this company, he would have violated the ban on accessing frozen funds,"" is how Munich II public prosecutors described the main thrust of their allegations to DW.
First, however, it would have to be proven that the money in the accounts of the companies in question is indeed Usmanov's money, sources from law enforcement agencies have admitted.
Citing their own sources, German media outlets have reported that investigators are looking into the circumstances surrounding the multiple transfer of assets from trusts, first to Usmanov's sister, then to unknown third parties. It could be that questions regarding the payment of gift tax might arise in this context.
Whatever the outcome of this case regarding assets in Germany attributed to Alisher Usmanov, Buckenhofer said the activities of the law enforcement agencies will not have been in vain.
""It should be a clear goal of financial policing to make life so difficult for these people that they at least find Germany unattractive as a location,"" he said.
DW did not receive an official response to its written inquiries to Alisher Usmanov's lawyers.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-metalworkers-union-secures-55-wage-hike/a-67742752,BUSINESS,German metalworkers union secures 5.5% wage hike 16.12.2023,"Germany's IG Metall, Europe's largest industrial union, announced on Saturday reaching a new wage agreement for some 68,000 workers in north-western Germany.
The announcement comes after calls for a 24-hour strike in the north-western city of Duisburg.
The agreement was reached in the fifth round of talks. It follows a 14-hour round in Dusseldorf and a series of strikes which began after the former pay deal expired at the end of November.
The deal includes an inflation compensation payout of €3,000 (approximately $3,270). It also includes a 5.5% wage boost, effective as of January 1, 2025, and until September 30, 2025.
As per the deal, workers will also have job guarantees against changes in the sector, such as transitioning from coking coal to hydrogen to meet demands to cut carbon emissions.
The union also managed to reduce standard working hours to 32 per week, down from 35. However, it failed to maintain full pay; full-time employees who work 32 hours will instead be paid for 33 hours.
Germany's north-western Ruhr region in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) was historically where the majority of the country's coal and steel industries were concentrated. It remains to this day among Europe's most densely populated areas.
Separate talks between employers and IG Metall on behalf of some 8,000 workers in eastern Germany are set to begin on December 18, while talks for some 15,000 workers in Saarland — close to the French border — are scheduled for the end of February next year.

https://www.dw.com/en/as-serbia-prepares-to-vote-vucics-party-dominates-campaign/a-67726250,POLITICS,"As Serbia prepares to vote, Vucic's party dominates campaign 16.12.2023","On a Saturday in early December, hundreds of buses lined up along the wide streets of New Belgrade, a district in the capital. Crowds streamed toward the Belgrade Arena, one of Europe's largest sports venues, to attend the main election rally of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) . One man commanded all the attention: Serbia's autocratic president, Aleksandar Vucic.
""Our village leader organized the trip to Belgrade,"" said one man sitting on a nearby bench, swigging from a beer can. He said he was from a village in the country's north. ""Of course I support Vucic. He gave us all money, most recently 10,000 dinars (€85/$94) for welfare recipients,"" he told DW.
Election gifts are common in Serbia. This time, Vucic decided to make one-off state budget payments to pensioners, young people and the unemployed ahead of the parliamentary and local elections on December 17. Sometimes, these payments amount to 10,000 dinars, other times a little more or a little less.
For many in Serbia, this is a lot of money. After all, the average Serbian salary is only €725 (about $800) after taxes, and an average €330 ($360) for pensioners.
Vucic has promised to raise pensions in January, provided his party wins the election. The president himself is not standing for election, as he secured a second term in office last year. That said, this entire election revolves around him. Every SNS electoral list, even in the smallest village, bears his name.
Belgrade weekly magazine Vreme has described Vucic as the ""beggar king,"" saying he casts himself as a man of the people who distributes money, builds roads and railroads and creates jobs.
The opposition, in turn, has accused Vucic of ruling Serbia with an iron fist and playing off the European Union, Russia and China against each other. Critics have said Vucic's government maintains close ties with the mafia, and is deeply corrupt. Yet in his near daily television appearances, Vucic has accused his critics of being traitors and thieves desperate to take power.
At the election rally at Belgrade Arena, Vucic boomed: ""Serbia is one of the few countries in Europe today that has an independent agenda."" But despite the roaring applause that filled the venue, not everyone here attended out of their own volition.

A young man who said he works in a hospital in a small town told DW he was pressured into attending the rally. To keep their jobs, he and his colleagues were forced to attend the rally and vote for SNS.
 ""It's disastrous, but what can I do?"" he said.
Recent polls have shown that SNS in the lead. Although the party is unlikely to secure a landslide victory, it should be enough for SNS to continue its coalition with the Socialists and other smaller parties.
The main opposition, the pro-European Serbia Against Violence bloc, hopes to take second place in the election after the SNS. It was formed after two mass shootings in May 2023 shook the country to the core, sparking mass protests. The alliance has accused Vucic and his media outlets of fueling a violent atmosphere by broadcasting questionable reality shows and lambasting the opposition.

Pervasive violence and abuse of power are the most important issues ahead of the election, political scientist Srdjan Cvijic told DW. Serbia's opposition has stopped making the country's EU accession a campaign promise, in part because the process is taking too long.
""Putting the EU issue at the forefront would be political kamikaze,"" Cvijic told DW. ""All pro-government media outlets are spreading anti-Western vitriol. What good does it do the opposition to be pilloried for this, too?""
The EU is also losing popularity in Serbia because of disagreements over Kosovo. Serbia does not recognize the independence of the former southern province, despite pressure from Berlin and Brussels.
According to the 2013 Brussels Agreement, Serbia should recognize Kosovar documents and stop blocking Kosovo's path to UN membership. Pristina, in return, is to allow a Serbian association of municipalities in Kosovo.
Right-wing conservative and nationalist splinter parties, constituting the third key player in the elections, are campaigning on the Kosovo issue alone. They have accused Vucic of practically giving up Kosovo by signing off on various agreements.
Yet Vucic's biggest problems are connected to Russia's war in Ukraine, said Belgrade historian and political analyst Stefan Radojkovic. Serbia has one of the highest inflation rates in Europe, owing to high fuel costs, which undermines Vucic's narrative of economic success. Also, the EU and US want to maintain control in the Balkans and force Serbia into reaching a compromise with Kosovo, Radojkovic told DW.
There is relatively little campaigning to be seen in Belgrade, with only a few billboards here and there. And the SNS is almost the only party with enough cash to pay for television ads.
A recent petition by the ProGlas pro-democracy movement did, however, cause a stir. Dozens of intellectuals, actors and athletes called on Serbians to cast their ballots on December 17. Around 170,000 people signed the petition online.
""We don't have a reasonable state in Serbia, "" Vladica Cvetkovic, a well-known professor who was one of the first to sign the petition, told DW. ""We lack democracy, justice and equality, we can only change that if we raise our voices.""
The election will be a tight race, especially in Belgrade. Polls suggest the opposition could triumph in the capital, which would be seen as an important symbol. After all, former autocrat and warlord Slobodan Milosevic also lost Belgrade and other major cities in 1996, before being voted out of office in 2000. Both times, Milosevic only gave in after continuous protests. At the time, Vucic served as his information minister.
Yet many things would have to fall into place for Vucic to lose power. Pro-European and pro-Russian forces would, for instance, need to form a coalition against Vucic. But looking back at the 1990s should make one cautious, Sofija Mandic, a lawyer who sits on the election committee on behalf of the opposition, told DW
There is considerable evidence the government is preparing to commit election fraud, Mandic told DW. ""Voters must be able to freely express themselves,"" she said. ""And they must be prepared to stand up for their political beliefs aside from voting, if necessary.""

https://www.dw.com/en/mali-last-german-troops-return-told-mission-not-in-vain/a-67740812,POLITICS,"Mali: Last German troops return, told mission 'not in vain' 15.12.2023","The last Bundeswehr troops serving in Mali as part of the international MINUSMA peacekeeping mission flew back to a German air base on Friday. 
This follows the gradual shutdown of the operation after Mali's military government forged close ties with Russia and ultimately demanded first that French soldiers leave and then that all international peacekeepers depart.

Despite the abrupt end to their duties, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told the soldiers they had served with distinction. 
""In the end, the political circumstances in Mali for a useful mission simply did not exist anymore. Your withdrawal was, therefore, the consistent and correct decision,"" Pistorius said at a ceremony at the Wunstorf air base in northern Germany. 
A group of just over 300 soldiers returned on two transport planes on Friday. Germany's Defense Ministry said roughly 20,000 Bundeswehr military personnel had served in Mali over the years. 
""So, what is our conclusion? You, dear soldiers, you have fulfilled your mission. Your achievements were excellent, and what you, and the contingents before you, achieved was not in vain and did not go unnoticed,"" the Social Democrat (SPD) politician said.  
Mali's current military government took power in a coup in 2021, deposing rival soldiers who had seized power the previous year. Both juntas claimed their rule was a temporary step and that they were dissatisfied with the former government's efforts in fighting insurgencies.
The new leadership in Bamako started cultivating closer ties to Russia, and particularly to its quasi-official international mercenary Wagner Group for security matters. 
Soon, the junta was demanding first that troops from colonial power France leave its soil, which prompted international members of the roughly 13,000-strong MINUSMA force to start winding down the mission of their own accord. In July, the junta called for all UN peacekeepers to leave. 
The government of Colonel Assimi Goita, the interim president, recently again delayed plans for elections, citing unspecified ""technical reasons."" It did not announce a new target date for what would be the first national vote since 2018 as it postponed the February 2024 appointment.
The story echoes the recent history of several West African countries, including Guinea, Burkina Faso and, most recently, Niger — all of which have experienced military takeovers of civilian governments since 2020 without subsequently restoring an elected government. 
Pistorius told the troops on Friday that security in the Sahel region was still ""of central importance"" to the government in Berlin. He also lamented how ""external powers like Russia and China"" were trying to ""exert more influence"" in the region. He said that Germany would ""remain present in the region,"" but ""in an adjusted form.""
To that end, Pistorius said at the ceremony that he would soon be traveling to Niger, itself the site of a coup earlier this year that most Western countries initially condemned. 
Niger's status as the last remaining major Western partner in the region has left those countries walking something of a tightrope — wanting to appear loyal to elected president and former partner Mohamed Bazoum while simultaneously trying not to burn their last regional bridges in Niamey.
Pistorius told the troops that strategic contacts in the Sahel region remained important, even after the end of the Bundeswehr's operations in Mali. 
""Therefore, I will fly to Niger early next week,"" he said, albeit conceding that no agreement was yet in place with the new leadership. 
""I believe that we are well advised to be present on-site, to stay in contact,"" Pistorius said. ""Simply leaving is not the solution."" 
The Bundeswehr's presence in Niger, around 120 men and women at last count according to the Defense Ministry, is around 10 times smaller than Germany's recent MINUSMA contribution had been prior to the wind-down.
Although the mission does appear to be in jeopardy given Niamey's new rulers, several ministers have also said the operation also serves German interests, hinting at least at a theoretical willingness to reach some agreement with Niger's leadership.

The military operation in Mali, which Germany participated in for around a decade, had been billed as another element of the slow process of Germany's military returning to more frequent overseas deployments.
NATO allies had long been pushing for Germany to move away from its defensive-only military posture adopted after its defeat in World War II.
The largest such example to date, by far, was in Afghanistan, a two-decade operation that also ended very differently to how Berlin might have hoped — with the Taliban regaining control of the country even as the last Western troops were still trying to leave.

https://www.dw.com/en/tunisias-2024-election-what-role-will-migration-play/a-67736521,POLITICS,Tunisia's 2024 election: What role will migration play? 15.12.2023,"Even though coverage of migration has dropped considerably since Israel's war in Gaza was triggered by an attack from the Islamist terror organization Hamas on October 7, thousands of migrants have nevertheless continued trying to reach Europe via the Mediterranean Sea.
According to a recent statement by the Italian Interior Ministry, around 146,000 people arrived in Italy via small boat between January and November 2023 — a 65% increase compared to 88,476 persons in the same period in 2022. Half of them departed from Tunisia, authorities said.
However, in the same period, the Tunisian Coast Guard also prevented 69,963 people — double the 2022 figure of 31,297 — from crossing into Italian waters. Most of those migrants were intercepted near Tunisia's eastern coastline, close to Sfax, which is only around 130 kilometers (80 miles) from Italy's Lampedusa island.
The coast guard's recently published statistics also point to a heavy increase in the number of non-Tunisians — 78% in 2023, compared to 59% in 2022 — making the dangerous journey.
One of those migrants is Enosso from Burkina Faso, who asked DW not to publish his last name. ""I arrived in Tunisia three months ago and have tried to cross into Italy twice so far,"" the 30-year-old told DW. ""Each time, it cost around €1,000 ($1,091),"" he added. However, the first journey ended after only 7 kilometers, the second after 12.
""The Tunisian Coast Guard [agents] were not violent, they only prevented us from crossing and returned us to Sfax,"" said Enosso.
Not everyone is lucky enough to simply be sent back to Tunisia, Lauren Seibert, a refugee and migrant rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, told DW. This year, HRW documented multiple cases of mistreatment and unlawful collective expulsions by Tunisian police, military, National Guard and Coast Guard during and after boat interceptions.
""If the interceptions increase without effective oversight and accountability, there is a risk that we'll keep seeing more abuses against intercepted migrants,"" said Seibert.  
Notwithstanding such risks, Mohammed Awal Saleh from the Republic of Benin is also waiting for his chance to migrate to Italy.
Tunisian police picked him up a few weeks ago and dropped him at an olive grove outside Sfax. ""It rains now and we don't know where we can take shelter,"" he told DW.
In June, the European Commission offered Tunisian President Kais Saied a richly funded Partnership Program, also dubbed a ""migration pact,"" aimed at curbing migration to Europe.
At the time, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised up to €900 million ($967 million) in aid for economically strapped Tunisia, and a further €105 million in 2023 to curb irregular migration — nearly triple the amount the EU had given Tunis over the previous two years.
Saied, however, reiterated that his country would not become a migrant gatekeeper.
""So far, there is only a Memorandum of Understanding, it is not binding and lays out five areas of cooperation, such as energy transition or education, with only one pillar addressing migration directly,"" Heike Löschmann, director of the Tunis office of the German Green Party affiliated Heinrich Böll Foundation, told DW.
Löschmann also said there are recurring misrepresentations in the media that Tunisia, unwilling to take alms, sent back €60 million from a first tranche of the ""migration pact.""
""The reality is that the Tunisian government sent back a last outstanding payment for a post-pandemic economic recovery package unrelated to migration, but it obviously landed a good PR stunt,"" explained Löschmann.
Still, Ramadan Ben Omar, an official in the Tunisian Forum of Economic and Social Rights, told DW that migration has been decreasing since October, and not only due to harsher sea conditions in autumn and winter. ""Tunisian authorities have tightened border controls and started security campaigns against smugglers and boat manufacturing workshops,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Hager Ali, a researcher at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies, a German think tank, told DW there ""is a good chance that the migration dynamics didn't have all that much to do with the migration deal.""
Ali said the increase in the number of non-Tunisians intercepted by the coast guard this year reflected the political situation in countries like Burkina Faso, Mali, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Sudan, Eritrea and Libya.
""These countries have seen a surge in military coups, political and economic volatility, extreme violence, persecution and internal displacement in the past two years, which prompted many people to leave,"" she added.
Löschmann of the Böll Foundation said this could also explain why the percentage of Tunisians among all migrants seeking to reach the EU dropped from 41% in 2022, to 22% in 2023, according to coast guard statistics.
Löschmann said  younger Tunisians' desire to leave the country remains unabated, but added that the overall ""proportion of Tunisians among arrivals decreased because the number of migrants from other countries, particularly from sub-Saharan Africa, increased enormously.""
Moreover, conditions for migrants in Tunisia further deteriorated throughout 2023. In February, President Saied sparked a wave of violence against Black migrants by alleging they threatened to transform ""Arab-Muslim"" Tunisia into an ""African"" country.
And, over the summer, when thousands of non-Tunisian migrants were expelled to the desert near Libya, more than 100 died.
According to Tunisia's National Institute of Statistics, inflation remained at a high of 8.3% in November, while unemployment remained steady at 15%.
Meanwhile, the agricultural sector, which provides jobs for many migrants saving up for their journey to Europe, has been hampered by ongoing drought, resulting in a 16.4% contraction in economic output.
""Even buying food has become difficult, at times I can't even afford 'assida' wheat dumplings anymore,"" Mohammed Awal Saleh from Benin told DW.
In turn, observers have no doubt that the upcoming presidential elections in November 2024 will most likely be dominated by two topics: migration and the economic crisis.
Saied, who was democratically elected in October 2019, has been acting increasingly authoritarian since July 2021. He has also lost a lot of support since taking office, especially among young voters, said Ali. 
""A lot is at stake for Kais Saied,"" the researcher told DW, adding, ""Unfortunately, we have seen over the last few years of European elections that vilifying migrants, especially from sub-Saharan Africa, works well as a campaign strategy because it misdirects voters' frustration towards vulnerable people who provide an easy target.""

https://www.dw.com/en/decoding-china-wolf-warrior-diplomacy-echoes-us-mistakes/a-67737465,CONFLICTS,Decoding China: 'Wolf Warrior' diplomacy echoes US mistakes 15.12.2023,"""Philippines should recognize the risks of playing the role US has assigned it,"" ran the headline of an editorial published by the state-run English-language newspaper China Daily in early December.
The article comes at a time of heightened tensions between Beijing and Manila over their territorial dispute in the South China Sea, involving various islands and reefs in the waterway.
Over the past few months, both sides have had several confrontations in the region, most notably around the disputed Scarborough Shoal.
At the beginning of November, Manila announced its withdrawal from China's Belt and Road Initiative, a massive project launched in 2013 by President Xi Jinping to boost Beijing's economic and political influence by building roads, railways, ports and other infrastructure around the globe.
In the editorial published by China Daily — a publication controlled by the central propaganda department of the Chinese Communist Party — the paper described the Philippines as having no interests of its own and pursuing a policy on behalf of the US.
Washington is only pretending to strive for a ""rules-based order"" in the Asia-Pacific region, the paper said. ""The US is the biggest threat to the region's peace and stability. It is looking to exploit proxies in the region for its troublemaking, and unfortunately the Philippines has obliged,"" the article reads.
In September, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi once again warned the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) — an organization founded in 1967 to improve cooperation across 10 Southeast Asian nations, including the Philippines — against becoming ""pawns"" in a geopolitical chess game, according to a report in the South China Morning Post.
Such warnings, however, are nothing new.
Wang made similar statements in March 2022, at a press conference held on the margins of the annual session of the National People's Congress. He stressed that China and ASEAN must guard stability in the Asia-Pacific, adding that both sides wanted peace, stability and prosperity for the region.
""The Asia-Pacific is a region for cooperation and development, not a chessboard for games between major powers,"" Wang said at the time.
The China Daily article is not an isolated case.
Beijing wants to push the US out of the Indo-Pacific and expand its own influence in the region.
It would appear that Chinese diplomats and, in particular, the state press are adopting an increasingly aggressive tone. But this kind of posturing is not in line with its foreign policy goals, said Collin Koh, senior fellow at the Institute for Defense and Strategic Studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.
""China tends to try to distinguish itself from, say Western great powers like the US by impressing upon the fact that, instead of running for hegemony, we run for common development,"" Koh told DW, stressing that China wants to be considered a ""benevolent great power.""
Still, he noted that China behaves like any other great power.
It doesn't mean Beijing doesn't take the interests smaller countries into consideration, but they will do so if those interests align with their own interests, the expert explained. He added that if those interests are not aligned with China's, or seen as detrimental to Beijing, this causes China to act the way it does right now with the Philippines.

China has changed its foreign policy style over the past decade.
Under Xi, Beijing seems to have abandoned the much-quoted dictum of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, ""Hide your strength, bide your time.""
China's role as the world's second-largest economy and its almost indispensable position in the global supply chains has allowed Xi to pursue a more assertive foreign policy.
Beijing has also been forced to set new foreign policy priorities as a result of the US government's confrontational trade policy, particularly under former US President Donald Trump, said Koh.
""Due to the deterioration of ties with the US, China started to somehow look upon foreign policy issues and frame them largely from the perspective of its ties with the US,"" he said.
The same can be said for the US, which often views its presence in Southeast Asia in the context of competition with China, he underlined.
China is repeating the same mistakes that the US made in Southeast Asia in the 20th century, wrote Charles Dunst, researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in the magazine Foreign Policy back in 2020.
In the article, he recalled the 1958 novel ""The Ugly American"" by Eugene Burdick and William Lederer, which depicted the failures of US diplomacy in Southeast Asia due to what it called the innate arrogance of US diplomats and their failure to understand the local culture. ""China is acting in the same way there today,"" Dunst underlined.
Political scientist Koh said it has taken the US many years to understand regional and local sensitivities in Southeast Asia.
Washington is now able to cope with the divergent positions of ASEAN states, and does not always want to impose its will on them, he noted, pointing out that in a democratic system, there's space for different opinions and objective discussions.

But China acts differently, said Koh. In China's autocratic system, it is a matter of executing the will of the Communist Party leadership, even when it comes to dealings with other sovereign states.
Beijing's new foreign policy style has a name: ""Wolf warrior diplomacy,"" named after the 2015 action movie and box office hit ""Wolf Warrior"" by director and actor Wu Jing.
The wolf warrior diplomats are nationalistic representatives of the Chinese government who aggressively defend Beijing's foreign policy line.
On several occasions, they have referred to other countries as ""vassals,"" ""puppets"" or ""stooges of the US.""
Koh considers this type of diplomacy to be counterproductive. ""It serves no other purpose than simply to alienate your friends. It creates a bad perception or image of China,"" he said.
According to Koh, some in the Chinese Communist Party have now recognized the risk posed by this stance. However, this has not prompted a change of course so far, seeing how developments in recent years have affected not only the state apparatus and the media, but also the general population.
""Younger Chinese people these days, they will not tolerate a government that is softening on foreign policy, simply because they are born in an era where they view China, and they know of China, as a strong country, not a weak country,"" he said.
The China Daily editorial therefore fits the picture, as it tells the young readers in China exactly what they want to hear.
""Decoding China"" is a DW series that examines Chinese positions and arguments on current international issues from a critical German and European perspective.

https://www.dw.com/en/pakistans-farms-mines-in-trouble-with-afghans-pushed-out/a-67736498,MIGRATION,"Pakistan's farms, mines in trouble with Afghans pushed out 15.12.2023","The abrupt departure of thousands of undocumented Afghans has left Bibi Jawzara, an elderly Pakistani woman, ""really worried.""
For decades, she has relied on Afghan migrants to tend her farm in the southwestern province of Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan. But with Pakistani officials launching an effort to expel some 1.7 million undocumented Afghans last month, the septuagenarian has been struggling to find skilled workers to prune and fertilize apple trees and grapevines on her land.
""The crucial fertilizer time is upon me but I don't have enough workers for this job,"" she told DW. ""As my sons and grandsons live in cities for business and education, Afghan refugees cared for our orchards for years. But now as they suddenly left for home to avoid deportation, we find ourselves in a real predicament.""
Jawzara used to employ members of five Afghan Pashtun families, who fled their country after the Soviet invasion in 1979. Refugee women used to do chores in her house and men worked in fields, with the Pakistani woman and two of her sons supervising and helping them.
Even with new generations in the small community born and raised in Pakistan, they tended to live on Jawzara's farmland and be dependent on their employer for food, health care and other needs.
But the recent anti-immigrant clampdown has changed everything.

Most undocumented Afghans in Pakistan were living in Balochistan and northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces — both bordering Afghanistan — and never felt residency documents were necessary, with their lives limited to their areas.
Earlier this year, the Pakistani government declared the presence of undocumented migrants to be both a security and economic challenge. Hundreds of thousands have already been expelled or left on their own.
And, despite Pakistani officials pledging that 2.3 million legal Afghan migrants were free to remain as long as their papers are valid, more than a few documented migrants also returned to their home country. They feared that Pakistan would soon try to deport them as well, and warned that the authorities look determined to send all Afghans — whether documented or undocumented — home.
Afghan laborers have a reputation of being cheap, skilled and hardworking. They are also in a vulnerable position due to their living on foreign soil. The mass exodus has now sparked labor shortages in sectors like agriculture and mining in Pakistan's border areas.
""Orders for [undocumented] migrants to leave caught our Afghan workers, as well as us, off guard. Neither were they mentally prepared to go away on short notice, nor did we have any idea of what to do without them,"" said Jahangir Shah, who owns a coal mine in Balochistan's Duki district.
Afghans make up 60% of Shah's employees. The repatriation effort, according to the mine owner, forced him to briefly suspend mining operations. Even after the work was resumed with extended shifts, production was very slow due to labor shortages. Shah fears production targets will not be met.
""Our bids to return to normal face challenges, especially the unavailability of skilled workers,"" he told DW, adding that workers from other areas are ""not coming in despite offers of better payment.""
Pashtuns are the dominant ethnic group in Afghanistan, with millions of them also living in Pakistan. Sardar Muhammad Shafiq Tareen, a Pashtun serving as a senator in Pakistan's Balochistan, warns that almost 80% of workers in the mines and farms across the province were Afghan people.

The exodus of Afghans will also stop remittances from Pakistan into Afghanistan, harming the latter's economic development, he said. The war-ravaged country is already facing a massive crisis following the Taliban takeover in 2021.
Tareen echoed the concerns of many activists and international organizations, noting that Afghans were given very little time to return to their home country despite spending years or decades on the other side of the border. Speaking with DW, he questioned the Pakistani government narrative that most departures were voluntary.
Various political parties and trader associations have been protesting government policies since October 20 by staging a sit-in in the border town of Chaman. They have opposed visa restrictions in the wake of the anti-migrant clampdown.
Pir Muhammad Kakar, general secretary of the Balochistan chapter of the Pakistan Workers' Federation, pointed out that more than half of Afghans working in the province's mines had left, causing a ""doom scenario"" for the local mining industry, the largest income generator for the province.
Kakar said mine owners recently met caretaker Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti — himself a Balochistan native — who pledged to ensure that Afghan mine workers aren't unduly bothered. The minister also promised a proper policy to enable the workers to continue their employment, but this promise has yet to be fulfilled, according to Kakar.

Kira Yarmysh said she was told by a Russian court that Navalny was removed from the Vladimir region near Moscow on December 11, adding that ""It is not known where exactly"" he was taken. 
His aides say they fear Navalny has been potentially transferred to a harsher prison. 
The Kremlin on Friday told a press briefing it had no information on Navalny's whereabouts. 
""I repeat again: We do not have the capacity, or right, or desire, to track the fates of those prisoners who are serving sentences by order of a court,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

Navalny has been behind bars since January 2021. He is serving a 19-year sentence on several charges at a maximum-security prison in the town of Melekhovo in the Vladimir region, about 230 kilometers (140 miles) east of Moscow.
A fierce opponent of President Vladimir Putin, Navalny campaigned against corruption and organized large anti-Kremlin protests.
He was arrested on his return to Moscow from Germany, where he was recovering from nerve agent poisoning that he blamed on the Kremlin.
Navalny has since been sentenced to three jail terms and spent months in isolation in the penal colony for alleged minor offenses. He has denied all charges against him as politically motivated.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-lawmakers-approve-supplementary-budget-for-2023/a-67733890,POLITICS,German lawmakers approve supplementary budget for 2023 15.12.2023,"Germany's lower house, the Bundestag, on Friday approved a proposal by the governing coalition to suspend borrowing rules, known as the debt brake, before passing a supplementary budget for 2023.
It comes after weeks of negotiations in response to a shock ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court in November that decided €60 billion ($65.75 billion) in emergency loans to combat the coronavirus pandemic could not be reallocated to a climate fund that would have been the source for several areas of spending. 
Earlier this week, Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party governing coalition also struck a deal on spending for 2024 that will entail many drastic cuts.
To help finance the supplementary 2023 budget, German lawmakers agreed on higher CO2 price hikes set to take effect in January 2024 that will be felt at the gas pump and on home heating bills.
The price currently stands at €30 ($33) per ton of CO2, but this set to rise to €45 in 2024, instead of €40 as previously planned. Gasoline will become about 4.5 cents more expensive per liter. This is expected to grow government revenue by about €1 billion.

As part of the governing coalition plan to solve a budget crisis, lawmakers had to approve another exception on strict borrowing rules to retroactively cover costs like energy subsides for consumers.
It is the fourth time in a row the Bundestag has suspended the ""debt brake.""
Germany is notoriously wary of building up too much government debt. Under German law, additional borrowing is only allowed in the event of natural disasters or emergencies ""that are beyond the control of the state and significantly affect the state's financial situation.""
Germany's coalition government has justified the borrowing on several grounds, including the massive rise in energy costs due to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and reconstruction efforts following the 2021 floods in western Germany.
The planned new debt will then total €70.61 billion, which is €44.8 billion above the permissible borrowing limit.

https://www.dw.com/en/will-female-candidates-transform-politics-in-congo/a-67720205,POLITICS,Will female candidates transform politics in Congo? 15.12.2023,"In the city of Goma, in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, local resident Alexandrine Kisikutila is urging everyone around her to vote in next week's general elections. More specifically, for female candidates.
""As a Congolese citizen I'm ready to go to the polls and vote for a woman,"" she told DW.
""Not because I'm a woman too, but because I believe that women can achieve great things, as several renowned women around the world have proved. I think we can continue to have an impact on the world by supporting each other.""
Women have typically been underrepresented in Congolese politics. But now, support for female candidates is growing — particularly in the conflict-ridden east of the country.
Voters in Congo are due to head to the polls on December 20 to elect a president, as well as members of various assemblies and councils at a local and national level.
But entering politics has never been easy for women, who are still held back by cultural barriers.
Generose Kagheni, coordinator of the organization Women Today, which is engaged in the defense of women's rights in North Kivu province, believes women's rights are often flouted in Congo because not enough women are in decision-making positions.
""The low representation of women in decision-making bodies is a major factor affecting the consideration given to their specific needs, the allocation of resources and even the formulation of social and economic legal reforms,"" she told DW.
""That's why it's important to ensure that women participate at all levels of decision-making so that they can present and defend their rights in our highly patriarchal society.""

As a candidate in the presidential election, Marie-Josee Ifoku said she understands why many women shy away from the inevitable pressures of a political career.
""It's a pretty aggressive and insecure world,"" she told DW. ""If you don't have a strong personality, you're not going to make it in politics.""
Ifoku speaks from experience. As the official candidate for the Alliance of Elites for A New Congo party was the governor of Tshuapa Province from 2016-2017 and was the only female candidate to run in the 2018 presidential election. But despite the hardships, she is optimistic that more women will follow in her footsteps.
""In spite of everything, we've decided to defy fear, because you have to admit that there's a lot of fear behind it, and that takes courage and daring,"" she said.
Promoting greater gender equality across Congo is perhaps unsurprisingly one of the biggest goals of female candidates.
Joelle Bile, a journalist and politician who is running with Alternative pour un Congo Nouveau (Alternative for a New Congo), said women are the ones in the best position to defend themselves.
""Due to my status as a woman, I think it is difficult for me to let go of this important fact, so I can only continue to promise [the voters] that when I am elected, I will do better,"" she told DW.
""But also, policies will be formulated which will truly encourage the empowerment and advancement of women.""
Beyond gender equality, Bile has other plans for her country if elected.
""I would start by requesting a population census. From then on we will find the right solutions to the recurring problems of our society.""
Ahead of the vote, Ifoku is also making her ideas for the future of Congo known.
""I propose to rid Congolese society of an archaic system to move toward something new. We advocate awareness as well as national reconciliation,"" she said.
With the election being held against the backdrop of ongoing rebel violence, conflict resolution policies are the centerpiece of many campaigns.
""We want to rebuild and restore the Congolese,"" said Ifoku. ""It must be strong, rebuilt and it must be dignified. The brooms [used as a campaign logo] symbolize our fight and embody power. Cleanliness is unity. It is the new.""

https://www.dw.com/en/can-kevin-spacey-mount-a-cinema-comeback/a-67418933,FILM,Can Kevin Spacey mount a cinema comeback? 15.12.2023,"""There are no second acts in American lives,"" author F. Scott Fitzgerald famously wrote. Kevin Spacey might beg to differ. 
The American actor, a two-time Oscar winner, is trying to start a new chapter in his career, which took a hit after he was accused of multiple cases of sexual assault in the wake of the #MeToo movement. In the parlance of the times, Spacey was quickly ""cancelled.""
He was dropped by his Hollywood agent and publicist and fired from Netflix hit ""House of Cards."" Netflix also shelved ""Gore Vidal,"" a biopic starring Spacey as the late American writer and political gadfly, which had finished production just weeks before the first allegations broke.
Last year, Spacey lost his bid to overturn a $31 million arbitration award he was ordered to pay ""House of Cards"" producer MRC for sexual misconduct involving young crew members behind the scenes of the series. 
Most famously, Ridley Scott and Sony Pictures spent millions in expensive reshoots for the 2017 historical drama ""All the Money in the World,"" casting Christopher Plummer to replace him in the role of J. Paul Getty and digitally scrubbing Spacey from the film. 
Spacey always maintained his innocence and now that he has been acquitted in court of some charges — others were tossed out of court or dropped by prosecutors for lack of evidence — the actor is planning a return to the big screen. 
Sort of. 
Don't expect to see Kevin Spacey heading a Hollywood tentpole or Marvel franchise movie anytime soon.
Instead, ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""American Beauty"" star has been slumming it in the D-movie section, with small parts in obscure, low-budget independent films.
Last year, he had a supporting role in ""The Man Who Drew God,"" an Italian drama directed by and starring Franco Nero. It didn't get released outside Italy and Spacey's dialog was dubbed by a local actor.
Next month he will be heard — but not seen — in ""Control,"" a low-rent British thriller where he plays a threatening voice on a GPS system.
And next year, you can try and catch the ""L.A. Confidental"" actor in ""Peter Five Eight,"" a British action comedy that is slated for limited release. Thus, it would be premature to call any of these films Spacey's ""cinema comeback."" 
It's notable that Spacey's job offers, such as they are, are all coming out of Europe, where the film industry is notoriously permissive when it comes to artistic bad behavior, whether actual or alleged. 
Roman Polanski has spent the past 45 years making movies in France and thanks to his French passport, has successfully avoided extradition to the United States on the still-pending charge of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor.
Polanski's last feature, ""The Palace,"" premiered out of competition at the 80th Venice Film Festival this year. As did ""Coup de chance"" by Woody Allen, another filmmaker tarred by allegations of misconduct — by his adoptive daughter Dylan Farrow. Allen has found it easier to get his movies financed and distributed on the European continent than in the more judgmental United States. 
And Johnny Depp, who got dropped from the ""Harry Potter"" spin-off franchise ""Fantastic Beasts"" amid allegations of spousal abuse by his ex-wife Amber Heard, was cast to play King Louis XV in the poncy French period drama ""Jeanne du Barry,"" which opened this year's Cannes Film Festival. 
But, truth be told, the film industry, particularly the cash-strapped indie sector, has often been known to overlook ethical issues when there's money to be made.
Well before #MeToo, Mel Gibson was supposedly cancelled for public outbursts of homophobic, racist and antisemitic language. But while Gibson became — and remains — persona non grata for some, he never really stopped working.
You might not have seen the highlights of his post-disgrace career: ""Get The Gringo,"" ""Machette Kills"" and ""Dragged Across Concrete."" But those movies got made and Gibson got paid for making them. The recent outrage surrounding Gibson's casting in ""The Continental,"" a big-budget TV spin-off of the ""John Wick"" action film series, only shows how focused most of the media is on Hollywood. For fans of mediocre indie fare, Mel Gibson never went away. 
And neither will Kevin Spacey. As long as there are independent filmmakers who calculate that slapping a ""two-time Oscar winner"" tag on their trailers and posters can translate into an impulse buy or a few more streaming views from old ""House of Cards"" fans, Spacey will continue to make movies. Of a sort. Just don't call it a comeback.

Rescue teams reached the distressed boat at about 1 a.m. local time (0000 GMT) and found that one of its inflatable tubes had deflated.
Two unconscious people were pulled from the sea. One was airlifted to the French port city of Calais, while the other could not be revived, the coastguard said in a statement.
Boats and aircraft are still looking for remaining survivors around Griz Nez, near the port of Calais, the statement continued.
The English Channel, which separates the United Kingdom and continental Europe, is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world.
Tens of thousands of people a year have been making the dangerous crossing of the sea from France in small boats seeking to migrate to the UK.
So far this year, more than 29,000 migrants have made the perilous crossing in small boats, according to Migration Watch UK, representing a fall of about one-third compared to 2022.
The largest number of deaths in a single incident took place in November 2021 when at least 27 migrants died after a dinghy sank in the Channel.
In August this year, six Afghans drowned after their small boat capsized.

In late November, a migrant boat carrying 60 people sank and a man and woman drowned.
French authorities say that boats are increasingly overloaded, with the average number of about 53 passengers nearly double the average of two years ago.
The issue of small-boat migration has become a major political priority for the UK government and a bone of contention between London and Paris.

https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-gets-historic-eu-green-light-after-orban-drops-veto/a-67726459,POLITICS,Ukraine gets historic EU green-light after Orban drops veto 15.12.2023,"An EU summit in Brussels delivered an unexpected piece of welcome news at a bleak moment of the Russia-Ukraine war. Kyiv can soon begin official talks to join the European Union after getting the green light from the bloc's leaders on Thursday. Hungary, which had been threatening to veto the decision, stood aside at the last minute.
""This is a victory for Ukraine. A victory for all of Europe. A victory that motivates, inspires, and strengthens,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
Few had expected such a decisive outcome at the gathering of EU leaders in Brussels. Ahead of the two-day summit, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban had been pounding home his message that Ukraine was not ready to open accession negotiations — the first step in a long, winding and uncertain path to join the EU.
Orban arrived at the meeting guns blazing, repeating that his country was against opening talks with Ukraine as the sole opponent among the 27 member states.
""There is no reason to negotiate membership of Ukraine now,"" Orban told reporters, arguing that Kyiv had not fulfilled all the requirements set out by the European Commission in June 2022 in areas like tackling corruption, ensuring minority rights and reducing the influence of oligarchs.
He said he would also not sign off on an EU budget top-up, including €50 billion ($55 billion) of fresh aid for Kyiv over four years. He added, however, that he would consider this being financed from outside the budget.
Nine hours later, however, European Council President Charles Michel announced a surprise breakthrough on X: The European Council had decided to open accession negotiations with both Ukraine and Moldova and also to grant fellow aspirant Georgia candidate status, an important precursor to opening accession negotiations.
Within the hour, Orban posted a video message on the same platform. ""It is a completely irrational and incorrect decision to start negotiations with Ukraine,"" he said. ""On the other hand, the other 26 countries insisted that this decision be made […] for this reason, Hungary did not participate in this decision.""
Diplomatic sources told DW that Orban had left the room at the proposal of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. This cleared the way for the remaining 26 states to vote with no one in the room to object to the decision.
EU accession negotiations — even after they start — can often take years or even decades to complete. 

Following the decision on accession talks, however, Orban rejoined talks and prevented the bloc from approving €50 billion in financing for Kyiv, postponing further discussions until January.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said 26 EU countries agreed to provide Ukraine with the money from the EU budget until 2027, but Hungary was against that decision, which requires unanimity.
""I am fairly confident we can get a deal early next year, we are thinking of late January,"" said Rutte.
Under EU rules, member states must agree unanimously on important matters like accession to the bloc. While abstentions are technically allowed under these unanimity rules, the 27 member states often stay up late into the night seeking consensus at summits. Orban's absence was a rare deviation from this norm.
Back in November, the European Commission recommended starting talks with Ukraine. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the country had satisfied 90% of the criteria, praising Ukraine for recent efforts to reform its judiciary and anti-money laundering system against the backdrop of war with Russia.

Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said on X that it also was ""a very clear message to Moscow"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin: ""Us Europeans, we don't let go of Ukraine.""
Thursday's decision sent ""a strong message to Kyiv that simultaneously fighting off an invasion and pushing on with reforms have been worth the effort, and that Moscow's strategy of waiting for an erosion of European unity over Ukraine could yet prove a miscalculation,"" Simon Schlegel, a Ukraine analyst at the nongovernmental organization Crisis Group, told DW.
For Kyiv, the development comes at a moment of low morale, nearly 22 months since Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Weapons and cash are dwindling, and there are worrying signs coming from key allies in Europe and Washington on the political will to continue financial and military support for Ukraine.
""Ukraine faces a bleak year ahead. As temperatures drop, Russia has stepped up its bombardment and is signaling its belief that it can outlast Ukraine and the West. Ukraine's weapons supplies are depleted by the counteroffensive, and its allies are struggling to quickly ramp up production,"" Alissa de Carbonnel, another Crisis Group analyst, told DW.
Ahead of the EU leaders' summit, many in Brussels had speculated over what Orban had hoped to achieve by threatening to veto the accession talks.
On the eve of the summit, the European Commission unblocked about €10 billion in funding for Hungary that had been frozen as a punishment for alleged democratic backsliding under Orban. A further €12 billion remains frozen.
Unfreezing the funds was not universally welcomed, as some claimed Budapest had not met the necessary criteria.
""Von der Leyen is paying the biggest bribe in EU history to the autocrat and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin-friend Viktor Orban,"" German EU lawmaker Daniel Freund said on social media on Wednesday. ""The signal is disastrous: Orban's blackmail pays off.""
Regardless of how the deal came about, many EU leaders welcomed the decision to start accession talks on Thursday. One of them was freshly installed Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. 
""I dedicate our [sic] today's decision on enlargement to your heroes who gave their lives for an independent and European Ukraine,"" he tweeted.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-to-halt-admission-of-turkey-trained-imams/a-67722838,RELIGION,Germany to halt admission of Turkey-trained imams 14.12.2023,"A training program that posts Turkish imams to German mosques is to be phased out as Germany looks to train its own Muslim clerics in a bid to encourage integration, the Interior Ministry announced on Thursday.
Under a new agreement between the ministry, Turkish religious authority Diyanet and Turkish-Islamic umbrella group DITIB, about 100 imams are to be trained each year in the western town of Dahlem.
These imams will gradually replace the approximately 1,000 clerics which were trained and employed by the Turkish Diyanet.
""We need religious leaders who speak our language, know our country and stand up for our values,"" German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said in a statement.
""We want imams to get involved in the dialogue between religions and discuss questions of faith in our society,"" Faeser said.
According to the German Islam Conference (DIK), there are about 5.5 million Muslims living in Germany, or roughly 6.6% of the population. ""This is an important milestone for the integration and participation of Muslim communities,"" Faeser said.
Germany has about 2,500 mosque communities, 900 of which are managed by DITIB. A branch of the Presidency of Religious Affairs in Ankara, DITIB is the largest Islamic association in Germany but it has been accused of acting as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
The latest DITIB controversy came when an Afghan Taliban member spoke at one of the organization's mosques in the western city of Cologne last month.
In 2017, German officials called on DITIB to undertake fundamental reforms following allegations that imams sent by Diyanet had spied on behalf of Ankara in the wake of the failed coup against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government. Diyanet denied any involvement and a probe was closed without any charges brought.
Former Chancellor Angela Merkel first spoke in favor of training imams on German soil in 2018, telling parliament that it ""will make us more independent and is necessary for the future.""
The training of the 100 imams per year in Germany will take place as part of the existing DITIB program, as well as through an additional program, the ministry said. To this end, it said it sought ""cooperation with the German College of Islam"" in Osnabrück.

https://www.dw.com/en/nigerias-military-under-fire-for-accidental-civilian-casualties/a-67711372,CONFLICTS,Nigeria's military under fire for accidental civilian casualties 14.12.2023,"Ever since Nigeria embarked on its ongoing campaign against insurgents and bandits in the northern region of the country, numerous civilians — including children — have lost their lives. But in an increasing number of cases, these deaths have inadvertently occurred at the hands of the military itself.
A particularly distressing incident recently occurred in the village of Tudun Biri in northwest Kaduna State as residents celebrated a Muslim festival: On the evening of December 4, an army drone strike killed at least 85 civilians by mistake while the Nigerian military was carrying out aerial patrols in the area.
The military claims they ""misinterpreted"" the group's ""pattern of activities"" to be similar to that of bandit militias.The Nigerian government responded by promising to punish those responsible for the accidental strike.
However, the incident is part of a disturbing trend: At least nine miscalculated airstrikes have occurred between September 2022 and January 2023.

In the wake of the latest tragedy, calls for an investigation into the military's repeated mistakes have grown.
After President Bola Ahmed Tinubu ordered an inquiry into the incident, Muslim organization Fityanul Islam of Nigeria released a statement saying that ""all arguments advanced by the army about 'mistaken identity' are grossly inadequate, unfair and seemingly insensitive.""
""Military authorities must therefore come clean with more transparent information,"" it added.
Security experts attributed many of the military's mistakes to a lack of proper training and unreliable intelligence within the military.
Major Shu'aibu Bashir Galma, who has retired from the Nigerian military, emphasized the importance of confirming all intelligence reports before using them to conduct military operations.
""Any intelligence report that is not subjected to rigorous confirmation and re-confirmation is not considered to be reliable and should not be used for any type of military operation,"" he told DW.
Nigeria's Chief of Defense Staff, General Christopher Gwabin Musa, said on national television on December 6 that ""mistakes do happen,"" before calling for an increase in the military's budget.
That same day, a crowd of protestors took to the streets in Zaira near the site of the drone attack and in front of the National Assembly in Abuja to demand sanctions against the military.
Lawal Jafar Tahir, a political analyst from Yobe State University in Nigeria's northern city of Damaturu, underscored the need for decisive measures to prevent future tragic oversights.
""Those in charge of the technical know-how of army technology should be relieved, all of those that are responsible for this careless accident should be brought to book, and if they are should guilty they should be punished,"" he told DW.
""A serious investigation is needed in this calamity. This is not the first time, this is not the second time, this is not the third time.""
In response to the accidental bombing in Kaduna, Nigeria's Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Taoreed Abiodun Lagbaja, apologized to the victims' relatives and vowed to take substantial action to prevent more incidents in the future.
""We will do everything possible to prevent such an occurrence from happening again in the conduct of our operations going forward,"" he said.
Outside of Nigeria, the United Nations called on the military to review its rules of engagement and operations to make sure no such incidents happen again, while human rights watchdog Amnesty International called on the Tinubu administration to ""promptly"" set up an independent inquiry and ""ensure that those suspected to be responsible are brought to justice in fair trails.""

https://www.dw.com/en/kosovo-court-upholds-rebel-commanders-war-crimes-conviction/a-67719307,LAW AND JUSTICE,Kosovo court upholds rebel commander's war crimes conviction 14.12.2023,"The Kosovo court in The Hague on Thursday rejected the appeal of former rebel commander Salih Mustafa, who in 2022 was found guilty of torture and murder in the tribunal's landmark first conviction. 
The court, known formally as the Kosovo Specialist Chambers, upheld Mustafa's convictions for arbitrary detention, torture, and murder but reduced his sentence by four years, meaning he now has a jail term of 22 years.
During Kosovo's 1998-99 conflict with Serbia, Mustafa, 51, then a Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) guerrilla commander, ran a makeshift torture center where fellow ethnic Albanians accused of spying for Serb forces were detained, beaten and tortured, with one detainee dying.
""The appeals panel considers that a single sentence of 22 years of imprisonment ... reflects the totality of Mr. Mustafa's criminal conduct in this case,"" said presiding judge Michele Picard.
Picard stressed that the reduction in the sentence ""in no way suggests that the crimes for which he has been convicted and sentenced are not grave.""
However, she said a review of other ""comparable"" war crimes cases in Kosovo and elsewhere had shown that ""shorter sentences were imposed than those imposed on Mr. Mustafa.""
She called Thursday's ruling — the first appeals judgment in a war crimes case at the court — a ""significant step toward providing justice to victims and ensuring accountability.""
The Kosovo Specialist Chambers were set up in the Netherlands in 2015 to judge cases against former KLA guerillas pertaining to the 1998-1999 conflict, in which some 13,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, are believed to have died.
The high-security court operates under Kosovo law.
It is based in the Netherlands to protect witnesses from facing intimidation in Kosovo, as former KLA commanders are still very present in political life there.
The Kosovo war pitted the mainly Serbian forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which controlled Kosovo before the war, against the KLA, a Kosovo Albanian rebel group.
The fighting ended after a 78-day campaign of NATO airstrikes against Serbian forces.

https://www.dw.com/en/vladimir-putin-says-russias-goals-in-ukraine-remain-unchanged/a-67717119,POLITICS,Vladimir Putin says Russia's goals in Ukraine remain 'unchanged' 14.12.2023,"After a one-year hiatus, Russian President Vladimir Putin is again holding his marathon end-of-year press conference on Thursday, broadcast live on state television.
Last December, Putin canceled the press conference for the first time in 10 years. At the time, Kremlin watchers were convinced that Putin wanted to avoid questions from international journalists while his army suffered a series of setbacks in Ukraine.
But nearly two years into his offensive, Putin may be sensing a resurgence in his fortunes. Ukraine's latest counteroffensive has failed to penetrate Russia's heavily entrenched lines, and support from its allies is fraying.
Russia's goals in Ukraine remained ""unchanged,"" Putin said about the conflict.
""There will be peace when we achieve our goals. Let's return to these goals: they have not changed. I'll remind you of what we talked about then: the de-nazification of Ukraine, its de-militarization, its neutral status,"" he said.
Peace, he said, would only be possible after de-militarization.
""If they don't want to come to an agreement, then we are forced to take other measures, including military ones. Or we will agree on certain terms. There are other possibilities — either reach an agreement or resolve it by force. This is what we will strive for.""
Putin said that Russian forces were improving their positions along the front line. In a rare detail, he said around 617,000 troops were on the battlefields in Ukraine and dismissed the need for another mobilization wave.
The Russian president also claimed that Ukraine had lost some of its best fighters, while trying to secure a foothold on the east bank of the Dnipro River in the Kherson region.
""I think it is stupid and irresponsible on behalf of the political leadership of the country,"" Putin said. ""It is a tragedy, I believe, for them.""

Putin said he was hopeful that Moscow and Washington could find a solution regarding the detention of two high-profile Americans — detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US marine Paul Whelan.
""There are contacts on this issue and dialogue is ongoing, but it's not straightforward,"" Putin said.
""I hope we will find a solution. But the US side should also hear us and make a decision that will suit the Russian Federation,"" the Russian president added.
Gershkovich was arrested during a reporting trip at the end of March in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, thus becoming the first Western reporter to be held on spying charges in Russia since the Soviet era.
Former US marine Paul Whelan has been in a Russian jail since 2018, accused of espionage
Putin, who recently announced he'll run for another presidential term in the March 2024 election, uses the show to portray himself as a problem-solver.
Unlike Putin's previous year-end press conferences, there was no official accreditation procedure this time, and the Kremlin issued invitations only to selected journalists.
The press conference will be followed by a carefully choreographed call-in television show for ordinary Russians called ""Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.""
Citizens who get a chance to ask Putin a question tend to focus on domestic issues, with health care, the economy and infrastructure being common topics.
More than one and a half million questions have been submitted, Russian state media reported.

https://www.dw.com/en/us-house-votes-to-open-biden-impeachment-inquiry/a-67716689,POLITICS,US House votes to open Biden impeachment inquiry 13.12.2023,"The US House of Representatives on Wednesday has formally authorized the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden. 
The resolution was approved by a vote of 221 to 212. Republicans voted unanimously to formalize the ongoing investigation. Democrats voted against.
Republicans accuse Biden of being involved in controversial foreign business dealings of his son, Hunter. The president has denied the allegations.
Former Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy had already ordered a ""formal impeachment inquiry"" against Biden on September 12. The White House has rejected the investigation as unfounded and politically motivated.

Reacting to the vote, Biden said that Republicans in the House were focused on attacking him ""with lies."" In a statement released by the White House, Biden called the inquiry a ""baseless political stunt.""

So far, the investigation has found no evidence that Biden acted corruptly or took bribes in his current role or in his previous office as vice president, but Republicans are eager to continue it.
""We do not take this responsibility lightly and will not prejudge the investigation's outcome,"" Republican Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team said in a joint statement after the vote. ""But the evidentiary record is impossible to ignore.""
Meanwhile, House Democrats on Wednesday stood united in opposition to the resolution, calling it a farce perpetrated by those across the aisle to avenge the two impeachments against former President Donald Trump.
""This whole thing is an extreme political stunt. It has no credibility, no legitimacy, and no integrity. It is a sideshow,"" Democrat Jim McGovern said during a floor debate.
The Republican effort will almost certainly fail to remove Biden from office. Even if the House votes to impeach the president, the Senate would have to convict him on the charges by a two-thirds vote.
That's a near impossibility in a chamber where Biden's fellow Democrats hold a 51-49 majority. The inquiry could, however, help the Republicans to highlight their allegations of corruption for much of the presidential campaign in 2024.

When Germany's governing three-party coalition took power in late 2021, it repurposed €60 billion ($64 billion) in unused COVID-era loans for climate protection efforts. Yet in November, Germany's constitutional court ruled this reallocation unlawful, sparking protracted negotiations to draw up a new budget. The government does not intend to reapply for these loans.
Instead, it wants to reign in public spending even more than previously planned, while still keeping an eye on fulfilling its major policy goals. Recently, Chancellor Scholz summarized these as such: ""We are pushing forward the climate-neutral transformation of our country, strengthening social cohesion, and standing by Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia."" Adding that ""these three goals continue to guide us, but it is clear that we have to get by with significantly less money; this means cuts and making savings.""
Germany's free-market FDP is focused on cutting public expenditure. It had entered the budget negotiations convinced that Germany should heed its constitutionally enshrined debt brake in 2024. It stipulates that, in principle, the German state should only spend as much as it earns. It only allows the government to take out loans to a limited extent, unless it faces an emergency, in which case the debt brake may be suspended.  
The coalition wants to keep this option on the table, for example for financing reconstruction efforts in the Ahr Valley, which was devastated by floods in 2021.
""The constitution expressly stipulates that credit ceilings can be raised to deal with natural disasters and extraordinary emergencies,"" said Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Next year, €2.7 billion in flood aid will be financed through loans.

Authorities expect uncertainties and potential emergencies in connection with Ukraine. So far, €8 billion has been earmarked for direct aid in 2024, to be paid though the regular budget. But what would happen if the US — Ukraine's biggest financier — were to cease supporting the embattled country?
Speaking at a SPD party conference, Chancellor Scholz said a ""major"" financial challenge would arise ""when others struggle."" He said Germany would have to reach decisions to be able to handle such a situation. By this, he was referring to suspending the debt brake — a move the liberal FDP opposes.
FDP Finance Minister Christian Lindner appears, however, to have relented over Ukraine, saying that ""if the situation changes and the international community reaches joint decisions, we are fully capable of acting, including when options provided by the federal budget are exceeded.""
Flood reconstruction efforts and Ukraine assistance aside, next year's budget will entail cuts in many different areas. The climate and transformation fund now lacks €12.7 billion, funds which had already been earmarked for various projects, including overhauling Deutsche Bahn's rail network. This will now be paid for through the sale of German state-held shares. Deutsche Bahn itself wants to sell its freight forwarding subsidiary Schenker.
Subsidies for the solar industry, for installing climate-neutral heating systems and purchasing electric cars will be cut too, even though they were supposed to remain in place until the end of 2024. ""That pains me, but it's the price for keeping the central components, the pillars of the climate and transformation fund intact,"" said Economic Minister Robert Habeck of the Greens.
""We are reducing climate-damaging subsidies to the tune of €3 billion,"" said Finance Minister Lindner. So far, the German state paid €1.4 billion due to the EU's so-called plastic levy, yet going forward, companies that put plastic into circulation will be forced to foot the bill.
In addition, the CO2 levy for burning fuel, heating oil or gas will be raised sooner than planned. The price currently stands at €30 per ton but is set to rise to €45 in 2024, instead of €40 as previously planned. Petrol will become about 4.5 cents more expensive per liter. This is expected to grow government revenue by about €1 billion.
According to Finance Minister Lindner, an extra €1.5 billion will be saved by reducing social welfare spending. Efforts will be made, for example, to quickly integrate Ukrainian refugees into the German labor market. 
Friedrich Merz, chairman of the opposition CDU/CSU parliamentary group in the Bundestag, sharply criticized the government's budget announcement, calling it ""financial policy trickery, that's all it is."" He said it had squared the circle attempting to satisfy all coalition parties' wants. Merz thinks the government will run out of money with the planned budget.
Merz said in light of the ""dramatic"" developments in Ukraine, an emergency ought be declared by the middle of next year at the latest. Adding that political stability was declining as the military threat increases.
The government's 2024 budget has also been criticized by the business community. There are fears a higher CO2 tax will drive up prices.

https://www.dw.com/en/eu-wants-closer-ties-with-western-balkans-but-expects-reforms/a-67716065,POLITICS,EU wants closer ties with Western Balkans but expects reforms 13.12.2023,"European Union leaders met with hopeful counterparts from six Western Balkan countries in Brussels Wednesday to discuss their accession into the bloc.
Speaking before the EU-Western Balkans summit began, European Council President Charles Michel said, ""We are expecting more reforms from them, especially in the field of rule of law, in the field of the independence of justice.""
Michel emphasized ""strong political determination"" by regional leaders to see such reforms through. 
Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, called the potential expansion of the bloc to include Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia the EU's ""most important security guarantee,"" urging member states to move quickly to bring that expansion about.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said accession provided a ""historic opportunity"" to ""anchor"" the region in Europe ""once and for all.""

Several of the Western Balkan countries have been waiting on membership for over a decade with little progress to show for it.
Montenegro, for instance, applied for membership in 2012, followed by Serbia in 2014. Still, both remain far from fully aligning their legal systems with those of the EU.
Albania and North Macedonia both opened accession talks last year. Bosnia is hoping to do so later this week. Kosovo faces the added problem that many countries never recognized the independence it declared after breaking away from Serbia in 2008.
Borrell told EU member states, ""What we need to do is to deliver on our promises and avoid frustration and fulfil the expectation that has been created.""
That frustration was voiced by Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic, who blamed Western sanctions during the Yugoslav War of the 1990s for her country's refusal to vote for sanctions against Russia — much to the annoyance of almost all EU member states.
The EU has also proposed a €6 billion ($6.5 billion) Western Balkans economic fund, but this has been caught up in EU budget negotiations.
After concluding the Western Balkans summit, EU leaders will convene for a smaller EU summit to begin Thursday. Among the topics of discussion will be  Hungary's continued blocking of Ukraine's EU aspirations — possibly as a way to force the bloc to cut loose monies held up over Hungary's own judicial backsliding.

https://www.dw.com/en/israel-conflict-who-will-pay-for-gaza-reconstruction/a-67714098,CONFLICTS,Israel conflict: Who will pay for Gaza reconstruction? 13.12.2023,"Even as the fighting, dying and destruction continue, the arguments about money have started.
The human toll of the conflict in Gaza is incalculable. But the costs of rebuilding what has been destroyed through the Israeli bombardment of Gaza are not. Early estimates suggest they may be as high as $50 billion (€46.4 billion).
This week, Israeli media reported that the country's leader Benjamin Netanyahu had told his Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that the Saudis and the UAE would be willing to pay the bill for Gaza's reconstruction. This is despite the fact that Israel has not yet laid out a plan for who will govern Gaza if it succeeds in its goal of destroying Hamas.
It has also been suggested that Europeans will pay: The EU, and Germany in particular, have been major, long-term donors of humanitarian aid for the occupied Palestinian territories. The US is another of the biggest donors and likely to be called upon to fund reconstruction.
But in both the US and Europe, insiders report that, behind the scenes, decision-makers are already asking why they should once more pay millions in taxpayer money to rebuild infrastructure likely to be bombed again in the near future.
""I have heard senior EU officials say unequivocally that Europe will not pay for the reconstruction of Gaza. (The sums of money required by Ukraine are already mind-boggling),"" Gideon Rachman, chief foreign affairs commentator at the UK's Financial Times, wrote this week. ""The US Congress [also] seems to be turning against all forms of foreign assistance."" 
There have also been calls for Israel to pay for the damage it has inflicted during its current campaign in Gaza, with some arguing that because it is considered by the UN, the EU and other international organizations to be an occupying power there, it should shoulder rebuilding responsibilities.
In 2010, Israel did agree to compensate the main United Nations' agency working in Gaza — the UN Relief Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East, commonly known as UNRWA — $10.5 million for buildings destroyed during its far smaller 2009 operation in the enclave.
This was controversial both with some Israelis, who asked whether the payment meant they were admitting guilt, and human rights organizations, who said more should have been paid to victims. However, that appears to be the rare instance when Israel did agree to compensation.
Since the militant Hamas group attacked Israel on October 7, Israel has been bombing the Gaza Strip, home to more than 2 million Palestinians. Hamas is classified as a terrorist organization by Germany, the European Union, the US and others. Israel has also launched a ground offensive into the Gaza Strip and is blocking the delivery of food, water, power and most aid into the enclave. Fighting is ongoing.
As a result, over half of all of Gaza's housing has been destroyed — up to 50,000 housing units, with over 200,000 more damaged. Additionally, dozens of hospitals, and hundreds of schools and government buildings have been destroyed, as have agricultural facilities. Many were built with funding from international donors. 
During Israel's last offensive in Gaza in 2021, around 1,000 housing and commercial units were destroyed and a further 16,257 damaged, along with 60 schools. The cost of reconstruction then was estimated at around $8 billion (€7.4 billion).
""The level of structural damage and destruction is unprecedented,"" Marta Lorenzo, director of the UNRWA Representative Office for Europe said of the current conflict. ""It's not comparable to any other war in Gaza.""
""So right now, it's very difficult to know how much will it cost, but it won't be the responsibility of just one donor,"" Lorenzo said.
She told DW that what is most likely to happen when violence abates, is that there might be a pledging conference, ""during which we expect the international community to share responsibility.""
So who is most likely to foot the huge — and still growing — bill for all this? 
The answer is difficult because funding for aid and reconstruction in Gaza, as well as for the occupied Palestinian territories and other Palestinian-related projects, has been politically fraught for decades. The fact that Hamas has been ruling the enclave since 2007 has been problematic for donors, who have questioned how to get aid and money to those who need it, without also financing Hamas' military activities. 
A 16-year blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt, as well as years of neglect by the enclave's rulers, Hamas, has led to the degradation of the Gaza economy. In 2022, an estimated 80% of people in Gaza were dependent on aid, the UN has said.
UNRWA provided much of that aid before the current crisis, including social welfare services, schools and health clinics; it is Gaza's second-largest employer. It has also regularly had to fend off accusations of bias.
Senior ministers in the Israeli government have said they want to get rid of UNRWA altogether, while moderate politicians in donor countries believe the organization is essential.
Another example of the kind of controversies around reconstruction is the so-called Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism, or GRM. Created in 2014 as a temporary measure to prevent Hamas getting its hands on ""dual use"" building materials with which they could, for instance, build tunnels, it ended up becoming a complex, overly bureaucratic system , one that led to significant delays in getting building materials into Gaza. It also increased building costs by up to 20%, leading to charges that Israeli contractors were gaming the system for profit. Gaza builders even boycotted GRM-approved materials at one stage.
These controversies are not about to go away simply because of the greater need and exceptional destruction, predicts Nathan Brown, a senior fellow with the Carnegie Endowment's Middle East program. In fact, it's going to get worse, he noted.
""Funding is not going to be the issue, politics is,"" Brown told DW. ""If tomorrow, all the actors — Israel, the Palestinians, regional actors, Western actors — said 'here is the future, it will look like this,' whether that was a two-state solution or a one-state solution or whatever, then money wouldn't be a problem.""
Plenty of donors would be willing to give if it looked like the problem was on its way to being permanently resolved, Brown noted.
Over the past few days, there have been several reports that the UAE would indeed pay to rebuild in Gaza, but only if a two-state solution were guaranteed. ""Otherwise they're essentially financing what, to their own population, looks like an Israeli re-occupation of Gaza,"" Brown said.
Unfortunately, as Brown observed, a lasting solution seems unlikely for now. ""I don't see anything happening other than a series of makeshift arrangements that allows most major actors to simply find ways to make the consequences of this campaign manageable … to get it off the front page, if you like,"" he said.
Right now, there are too many unanswered questions, added Yara Asi, a non-resident fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC. ""If there's no legitimate governance in Gaza, will donors be comfortable sending tens of millions of dollars?"" Asi asked. ""I would imagine they would want some guarantee of a different kind of political future before they send all this money, all over again.""
On the other hand, she pointed out that if Europeans and Americans are genuinely unhappy that the greenhouses, schools and hospitals they help build are subject to repeated cycles of violence, then they should be making more determined attempts to help solve the problem.
""I think if they're tired of seeing this level of destruction, they can't just complain about the cost of the cleanup,"" she argued. ""They should be taking active measures to prevent it. Just imagine saying, well, it [reconstruction] comes with the presupposition that Israel will bomb Gaza again. Israel can really only do that with the support of these countries. So it's puzzling to me why they're not doing more about the problem.""

https://www.dw.com/en/would-congo-prosper-if-it-dumped-the-dollar/a-67711288,BUSINESS,Would Congo prosper if it dumped the dollar? 13.12.2023,"Seated on a little chair in the popular Lumumba market, located in the Bandalugwa district of the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, trader Rosette Kungi mixes beans in a large green bucket next to her cardboard price signs that change every day.
In recent months, the Democratic Republic of Congo's local currency, the Franc Congolais, or Congolese franc (CDF), has been heavily devalued.
A year ago, the CDF was trading at around 2,000 to the dollar — now it is trading at around 2,700.
""Prices in Congolese francs are rising all the time,"" Kungi lamented. ""Today, $10 is worth 27,000, or even 28,000 CDF — and soon it will be 30,000.""
""A box of fish used to cost $15, but now I buy it for $80,"" she told DW.
Another trader, Helene Timba, said that she needs to pay the price fluctuations every day. As she waved away the flies that landed on her fresh fish stall, she said that setting the price of goods has become a daily negotiation.
""We buy a bag of beans with dollars, but we sell it in Congolese francs,"" she said, ""and if we want to buy more, we have to buy the dollar, which is making our lives difficult.""
The country's economy was informally ""dollarized"" in 1994, when the DRC was known as Zaire and run by autocrat Mobutu Sese Seko. Inflation had reached an all-time high of 24,000% leading to the collapse of the economy. 
The US dollar is still considered the DRC's main commercial currency — while wages continue to be paid in the national currency.
Most of the country's goods are imported, and the war in Ukraine has caused the price of wheat, oil and other commodities to spike.
Some 62% of Congo's population — or 60 million people — live on less than $2.15 a day, according to World Bank data.

Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi is standing for reelection in elections due to be held later this month. 
""We won't vote if we're hungry,"" said Rosette Kungi.
""The president must make an effort to abolish this dollar so that our currency regains its value,"" said another trader. 
Congolese Finance Minister Nicolas Kazadi told reporters at the end of November that the DRC is ""too extroverted.""
""If we produced in Congolese francs, if we thought in Congolese francs, we would not have suffered the impact of the exchange rate,"" Kazadi added.
In order to import goods, the Congolese have to obtain dollars, and so the law of supply and demand justifies the Congolese franc losing its value,"" said economic analyst Al Kitenge.
""As products are imported, people need foreign currency to import them,"" said Al Kitenge, ""but when they come to the market to get foreign currency, demand is so great that the Congolese franc loses value because people are prepared to pay more to get that foreign currency and to import them.""
To stabilize its currency, the Central Bank of Congo has injected $150 million into the country's commercial banks — a measure that has brought relief to Congolese households for only a short time.
""A temporary solution,"" Kitenge pointed out.

https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-coalition-government-agrees-on-2024-budget/a-67707922,POLITICS,Germany's coalition government agrees on 2024 budget 13.12.2023,"Germany's ruling center-left coalition has managed to strike a political deal on the federal budget for 2024, government sources said on Wednesday.  
The agreement comes after a court ruling threw government finances into disarray and exposed deep rifts between the three governing parties.

Germany's constitutional court ruled on November 15 that the coalition government's decision to reallocate €60 billion ($64.69 billion) of unused debt from the COVID-19 pandemic era to its climate and transformation fund was unconstitutional.
The ruling limited the government's ability to set up and draw money from off-budget special funds to circumvent the constitutional ""debt brake,"" which restricts the annual public deficit to 0.35% of Germany's total economic output.

It blew a big hole in public finances. For the 2024 budget, the government has had to find an additional €17 billion ($18.3 billion) to fill the hole. 
The court ruling also raised tensions in Scholz's already fractious three-way coalition, which is made up of the Social Democrats (SPD), the environmentalist Greens and the business-focused Free Democrats (FDP).  
The three parties often have contradictory priorities and they have suggested different measures to resolve the budget crisis.
While the SPD and the Greens sound in favor of increasing taxes, the FDP has ruled out tax hikes and instead suggested welfare cuts.  
The SPD and the Greens are staunchly against any cuts to social benefits; they instead want to suspend the debt brake again for 2024 to allow for increased government borrowing. But the FDP opposes this move. 
Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Economy Minister Robert Habeck and Finance Minister Christian Lindner presented the details of the deal on Wednesday. 
Scholz said the government will reinstate the debt brake in 2024. ""We will keep to the debt rule... in budget 2024,"" said the chancellor.
""The government is sticking to its targets,"" he said, adding that there will be cuts and savings, as the government will have to make do with less money following the constitutional court ruling.
Scholz also stressed that the climate and transformation fund will remain a key instrument for the climate-friendly transformation of the German economy. But the fund will be cut by €12 billion for 2024, he said.

Addressing the Bundestag on Wednesday, Scholz said: ""We have agreed to prioritize spending without putting the social security of our country or its transformation at risk. The Federal Ministry of Finance will now quickly implement these political compromises and provide the Bundestag with all appropriate formultions.""
Scholz said of negotiations: ""It was hard, but constructive. In the end, we got a good, truly democratic compromise.""
Habeck said the ruling coalition agreed to end financial incentives to buy electric cars sooner than previously planned, without revealing the exact date for when they would expire.
He also said that subsidies for the expansion of solar power will be cut.
There will also be changes to how the renovation of the country’s rail network will be financed.
Lindner said the Deutsche Bahn, the state-owned national rail operator, should benefit from privatization proceeds. Deutsche Bahn wants to sell its subsidiary Schenker.
Lindner also noted that the government will slash climate-damaging subsidies to the tune of €3 billion.
The three coalition parties vowed to continue German support for Ukraine.
Lindner said Berlin plans to provide direct bilateral assistance worth €8 billion to the war-ravaged country next year. ""We will continue to shoulder this responsibility,"" said the finance minister.
Scholz stressed Germany would have to react should the Ukraine conflict worsen next year.
If the situation worsens, for instance, due to other supporters cutting back their aid to Ukraine or a further increase in threat levels faced by Germany and Europe, ""we will have to react to this,"" he said.
The chancellor said he expects the Cabinet to give its approval to the budget agreement as early as possible.

Despite the coalition's deal on a draft budget, it's not clear if there will be enough time for the lower house of the German parliament, the Bundestag, to approve it before the end of the year.
The failure to finalize a 2024 budget will result in the government starting next year with a provisional budget.
That means government expenditure will continue and essential services like social benefits, salaries and pensions will be paid out.  
But other spending like industrial subsidies will be frozen.  
Finance Minister Lindner will also get increased powers as he will have to authorize any new spending.

https://www.dw.com/en/cop28s-breakthrough-what-did-dubai-climate-talks-achieve/a-67692112,CLIMATE,COP28's breakthrough: What did Dubai climate talks achieve? 13.12.2023,"When delegates and leaders from around the world first gathered in Dubai at the end of November, the focus was on how the controversial issue of climate finance would play out at this year's UN climate talks. But as the two weeks of negotiations progressed, it was fossil fuels and the wording around their continued usage that claimed center stage. Would there be a commitment to phasing them out or a more diluted pledge to phase them down?

Ultimately, it was neither, but instead an agreement on ""transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade.""
Within minutes of the opening of a plenary session to present the new Global Stocktake text, COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber struck the gavel without objections. And history, he said, had been made.
""We have language on fossil fuels in our final agreement for the first time ever,"" he said. ""We should be proud of our historic achievement.""
Though the text does not mention a phaseout of fossil fuels — the burning of which is largely responsible for planetary heating — the wording is widely considered an improvement on language from a strongly criticised earlier iteration published on Monday.
""After decades of evasion, COP28 finally cast a glaring spotlight on the real culprits of the climate crisis: fossil fuels,"" said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International. ""A long-overdue direction to move away from coal, oil and gas has been set,""
But he also said the resolution is ""marred by loopholes that offer the fossil fuel industry numerous escape routes, relying on unproven, unsafe technologies.""

Pacific Climate Campaigner Joseph Sikulu said the text was ""still a death sentence for the Pacific,"" and that while there were small incremental changes to be celebrated, it did not do enough to address the phaseout of fossil fuels. ""We cannot continually come here and celebrate just the peanuts that is given to our region."" 
A coalition of more than 100 countries, including climate-vulnerable states, the US, Canada and the EU, had been pushing for agreement on phasing out fossil fuels throughout the conference, while major oil-producing nations, such as Saudi Arabia, insisted that the path forward was in phasing out fuel emissions. Though this would rely on carbon capture and storage technology that has not been tested at scale.
Despite the controversial choice of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as host — the Gulf state is among the world's top 10 oil producers — this year's climate conference started off on a high.
Delegates from more than 190 countries officially launched a loss and damage fund on the first day of the talks. Germany and the UAE both contributed $100 million (about €93 million) to help countries most affected by the increasingly extreme effects of climate change, like flooding, drought and rising sea levels. The United Kingdom, the United States and Japan also made smaller pledges, bringing the total thus far to $700 million.
Observers hailed the progress, though pointed out that far more is needed. According to estimates by climate experts, loss and damage funding will need to reach between $150-400 billion per year by 2030.
Singh said countries hit by disaster need sustained help, not just a couple of days or weeks of attention. ""We don't provide them enough support to recover from these impacts to rebuild their homes and livelihoods,"" he said.
Several other initiatives were also announced or advanced during the Dubai talks.
Some 130 countries pledged to double energy efficiency and triple the world's installed renewable energy capacity by 2030.
More nations also signed onto the 2021 Global Methane Pledge, backing efforts to reduce emissions of the highly potent greenhouse gas by 30% within this decade. And 50 oil and gas companies, who together produce about 40% of the world's oil and 35% of the combined oil and gas, also promised to eliminate methane emissions and routine flaring by 2030.
Methane, primarily generated by fossil fuel production and animal agriculture, is roughly 20 times more powerful when it comes to trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere. It's responsible for about a third of global warming, second only to carbon dioxide, but is comparatively short-lived. The plan to limit methane emissions is also easier to implement, with many methods ready to go.
These initiatives, if fulfilled, would help to slow global temperature change, but they are nowhere close to curbing warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times.
An analysis released by the intergovernmental International Energy Agency (IEA) on December 10 showed that pledges on renewables, efficiency and methane would only reduce energy-related emissions by 30% of what's needed by 2030.
After years of increasing deforestation under former president and climate skeptic Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil used COP28 as an opportunity to assume the role of global leader on climate change and conservation.
Speaking to delegates, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said: ""No country will solve its problems alone. We are all obliged to act together beyond our borders."" 
""Brazil is willing to lead by example,"" added Lula. 
Lula said Brazil had adopted new climate targets that were ""more ambitious than those of many developed countries."" 
Brazil also proposed a new global fund that would pay countries to keep their tropical forests intact. The country pledged to eliminate deforestation in the Amazon rainforest by 2030. According to figures from the Lula administration, the Amazon has already seen a 22% drop in forest clearance this year.

But Brazil also announced during COP that it was seeking to become an observer nation at OPEC+, a group of big petrostates. When asked about the contradiction, Lula said Brazil — among the top 10 oil-producing countries in the world — would aim to push other oil-producing countries to transition to green energy.
In December, Brazil's National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels plans to allocate more than 900 new areas for oil and gas exploration, including some in the Amazon. Speaking with DW, Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira defended the move, saying the exploration would be ""another source of wealth to combat inequality in Brazil, in an appropriate manner and in compliance with environmental laws.""

https://www.dw.com/en/argentinas-peso-plummets-50-in-bid-to-stabilize-economy/a-67707521,POLITICS,Argentina's peso plummets 50% in bid to stabilize economy 13.12.2023,"Argentina on Tuesday announced a significant devaluation of its currency as part of a series of drastic economic measures to address the country's ongoing economic challenges.
The peso will be weakened by over 50% to 800 per dollar, new Economy Minister Luis Caputo said.
""For a few months, we're going to be worse than before,"" Caputo said in a televised message, two days after libertarian Javier Milei took charge as the president of South America's second largest economy.
Argentina's annual inflation rate is at 143%, the currency has plummeted, and 40% of Argentines are living in poverty.

At his swearing-in ceremony, Milei promised a new era for the country but warned of painful austerity measures.
""The bottom line is that there is no alternative to austerity, and there is no alternative to shock treatment,"" Milei warned over the weekend. 
On Tuesday the economy minister also said that there would be cuts in the state's generous subsidies of fuel and transport.
Caputo said politicians had long supported the subsidies to ""deceive people into believing that they are putting money in their pockets. But as all Argentines will have already realized, these subsidies are not free but are paid with inflation.""
He said Argentina needed to handle a deep fiscal deficit, which he put at 5.5% of GDP, adding that the country had a fiscal deficit for 113 of the last 123 years, the cause of its economic crisis.
""We're here to solve this problem at the root,"" he said. ""For this we need to solve our addiction to a fiscal deficit.""
Aside from the spending cuts, Caputo also said that all state advertising would be suspended for a year, adding that it had cost 34 billion pesos ($92 million, €86 millon) in 2023.
In addition ""The state will not tender any more new public works, and will cancel approved tenders whose development has not yet begun.""
""The reality is that there is no money to pay for more public works that, as all Argentines know, often end up in the pockets of politicians or businessmen on duty,"" he said.
Another step would be canceling the renewal of public jobs contracts that were less than a year old.
President Milei has already cut nine government ministries, which Caputo said would slash 34% of all political jobs.
Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) deemed the measures ""bold"" and said in a statement it would ""help stabilize the economy and set the basis for more sustainable and private-sector led growth"" following ""serious policy setbacks"" in the past months.
""I welcome the decisive measures,"" IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said, calling it ""an important step toward restoring stability and rebuilding the country's economic potential.""

https://www.dw.com/en/poland-donald-tusks-government-wins-vote-of-confidence/a-67701233,POLITICS,Poland: Donald Tusk's government wins vote of confidence 12.12.2023,"The new government of Polish Prime Minister-designate Donald Tusk won a vote of confidence on Tuesday.
It comes a day after a majority of Polish MPs elected Tusk as the country's new prime minister when the proposed conservative government of acting PM Mateusz Morawiecki failed to win lawmakers' backing.
Tusk became prime minister nearly two months after national elections won by a coalition of parties ranging from left-wing to moderately conservative.
Tusk and his cabinet are set to be formally sworn in on Wednesday morning by President Andrzej Duda.
He previously served as Poland's prime minister from 2007 to 2014 before taking over as European Council president from 2014 to 2019.
Speaking to lawmakers on Tuesday, 66-year-old Tusk expressed a vote of confidence in the European Union.
""We are all the stronger, all the more sovereign when not only Poland is stronger but also the European Union,"" he said.

Tusk has vowed to improve Warsaw's relations with Brussels, which have been plagued by tensions during the past eight years of Law and Justice (PiS) party rule.
PiS repeatedly clashed with Brussels over rule-of-law issues, with the European Union casting doubts over the independence of the judiciary following an overhaul. 
Citing the concerns, the EU has blocked tens of billions of euros in grants and loans from the bloc's COVID pandemic relief program as well as development assistance. 
To get those funds flowing again, Warsaw will need to reverse changes to the judicial system.
On Tuesday, Tusk said he would go to Brussels this week and ""bring back billions of euros,"" referring to the frozen funds.
Still, laws to amend the justice system will need the assent of the president, Andrzej Duda, who comes from PiS ranks.
If Duda vetoes the legislation, Tusk's coalition doesn't have the three-fifths majority in the lower house of parliament to override it.
Duda will remain in office until the next presidential election, which is expected to take place sometime in 2025.
PiS also remains influential, with the outfit being the largest single party in parliament. Over the past eight years, the party has also appointed allies to key posts. 
Furthermore, Poland's Constitutional Tribunal ruled on Monday that judicial reform legislation which Warsaw needed to pass in order to access the EU funds was unconstitutional.

As Tusk promised close ties with the EU, he also underlined that he opposes any changes to EU treaties that are not in line with Polish interests.
""Any attempts to change treaties that are against our interests are out of the question ... no one will outplay me in the European Union,"" he said.
On Ukraine, Tusk said on Tuesday Warsaw will demand the full mobilization of the West to help the war-ravaged country.
""We will ... loudly and decisively demand the full mobilization of the free world, the Western world, to help Ukraine in this war,"" he said. 
The incoming prime minister also pledged to quickly resolve problems related to a protest by Polish truckers at several border crossings with Ukraine.
Tusk also stressed that Poland would remain a loyal ally of the United States.
He said, after visiting Brussels, he will travel to the Baltic states to strengthen relations.
""After returning from Brussels, I will go to Tallinn to meet the prime ministers of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Topics are obvious: the war, safe borders. We will strengthen cooperation with countries that share our views on this matter.""

A far-right lawmaker in the Polish parliament used a fire extinguisher to put out the candles on a menorah being lit in the parliament lobby for the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah.
""Someone extinguished the Hanukkah candles and a few minutes later we relit them,"" Poland's Chief Rabbi Michael Schudrich told Reuters.
""For thousands of years our enemies have been trying to extinguish us, from the time of the Maccabees right through to Hamas. But our enemies should learn, they cannot extinguish us.""
All major political forces quickly condemned the incident by Grzegorz Braun and said there would be no tolerance for antisemitic and xenophobic behavior in the Sejm, the Polish parliament.
The speaker of the parliament, Szymon Holownia, called the act ""absolutely scandalous"" and excluded Braun from the day's parliamentary proceedings. Holownia said he would report him to prosecutors.
Prime Minister-designate Donald Tusk condemned what he called an ""unacceptable"" act. ""It can't happen again, it's a disgrace,"" Tusk said as he waited for parliament to approve his pro-EU government, a vote now delayed amid the chaos caused by the incident.

https://www.dw.com/en/polands-new-pm-tusk-sets-bold-pro-eu-agenda-in-parliament/a-67706880,POLITICS,Poland's new PM Tusk sets bold pro-EU agenda in parliament 12.12.2023,"Poland's freshly appointed prime minister, Donald Tusk, has hit the ground running. The head of the pro-EU, center-left coalition is trying to make up for time lost to delay tactics from the previous nationalist, conservative government.
On Tuesday, just one day after his appointment by the Sejm , the lower house of the Polish Parliament, Tusk delivered a statement.
""October 15 will go do down in history as a day of peaceful revolt for freedom and democracy,"" he said, calling for the restoration of national unity. ""Strength in unity should be our first political imperative.""
With a view to Poland's future role in the European Union, he promised cooperation and respect for the European institutions. Poland would regain its leading role in the EU, he said. ""We are stronger and more sovereign when not only Poland but also the European Union is stronger and more sovereign,"" he emphasized.
""Stop pretending that friends and allies from NATO and the EU pose a threat to us,"" Tusk urged in his address to lawmakers. ""This is a risky, if not crazy, game,"" he said, in a pointed message to his predecessors. The previous government often had a fraught relationship with Brussels, marred by disputes over respect for the rule of law in Poland and migration.
The leader of the Justice and Development (PiS), Jaroslaw Kaczynski, had been playing for time ever since the party lost its absolute majority in parliamentary polls on October 15, trying to delay handing over power for as long as possible.
In recent weeks, important posts were handed to PiS supporters and funds from the budget channeled to PiS-friendly institutions.
Mateusz Morawiecki, who had led Poland since 2017, proceeded for weeks as if he could form a government despite lacking the parliamentary majority to do so. Poland's President Andrzej Duda, who comes from the same political camp, tasked him with forming a government a month ago, notwithstanding his lackluster chances of success.
But almost two months later, the PiS's stalling finally came to an end. The Sejm elected Tusk as the head of government on Monday evening.
The former president of the European Council received 248 votes, 23 more than required. He was opposed by 201 members. The house cheered. The communist-era dissident and former President Lech Walesa sat in the guest gallery fighting back tears as Tusk turned around to form a heart with his hands. At the end, the Sejm deputies rose from their benches and sang the Polish national anthem.
Shortly before, Morawiecki had lost a vote of confidence in parliament, with only 190 members backing him compared to the 266 who voted against him remaining in office.
Morawiecki tried until the end to win over members from the opposing camp with promises, presenting himself as a peaceful politician, calling for dialog and appealing to parliament to ""seek not what divides us, but what unites us"" in the face of challenges.
The outgoing head of government described the past eight years as a series of successes. Looking to the future, Morawiecki identified the expansion of the armed forces to 300,000 soldiers, a move to nuclear energy and the construction of a major airport in central Poland as essential tasks. Morawiecki emphasized that his plan ""will win in any case, if not now, then in the future"".
Tusk's coalition consists of three blocs: his Civic Coalition (KO), the Christian Democratic Third Way (TD) and the New Left. On Tuesday, the new prime minister announced that he would shed light on the previous government's time in office – in particular PiS financial scandals – and investigate the use of EU funds and the manipulation of public media.
Tusk also spoke out in favor of continued support for Ukraine and announced that Poland would assume joint responsibility for solving the migration issue. The previous government was a vehement opponent of EU plans to redistribute arriving migrants more evenly among the bloc's 27 member states.
The PiS leader saw things much more somberly. ""This is the end of Polish democracy,"" Kaczynski said in reaction to Tusk's appointment. He also railed against Russia and the EU. ""The plans that the European Parliament has adopted and that are being further shaped in the EU are a concept for changing the Polish state. It is to become a territory inhabited by Poles, but controlled from outside, from Brussels, basically from Berlin.""
Speaking to Polish broadcaster TVN, political scientist Anna Siewierska-Chmaj said that ""Kaczynski cannot resign himself to defeat.""
On Wednesday morning, the new cabinet will be sworn in by the head of state, Duda. Tusk, as the new Polish head of government, could fly to Brussels in time for the EU summit with the Western Balkan states and the European Council on Wednesday evening.
He will be supported on the world stage by Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, who already occupied the same position from 2007 to 2014.
Anyone who believes that Tusk will be an easy negotiating partner in the EU could be in for an unpleasant surprise. When asked about EU reforms while on the campaign trail, including the restriction of the unanimity principle for making EU decisions, Tusk warned against falling into ""integration enthusiasm"". Migration policy may also be a sore subject. The Polish government's approval of the distribution of refugees in 2015, when Tusk's party was last in power, was a big part of how the PiS came to power.

https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-braces-for-funding-battle-with-hungary-and-us/a-67705614,CONFLICTS,Ukraine braces for funding battle with Hungary and US 12.12.2023,"Volodymyr Zelenskyy's trip to the Americas has been marked by difficult conversations. On Sunday, the Ukrainian president witnessed the inauguration of his new Argentinian counterpart, right-wing libertarian Javier Milei. Sat near Zelenskyy at the ceremony was none other than the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban.
It didn't take long for a 21-second video clip of them talking to start making the rounds on the internet. You can't hear what the pair are saying, but the body language seems clear. Even from a vantage point as far away as Buenos Aires, Ukraine and Hungary's positions remain miles apart.
Both of them separately commented on their exchange later. In an evening video address, Zelenskyy, who is hoping his country can join the European Union, said that he had presented Ukraine's European policy interests to Orban ""as openly as possible"".
The Hungarian Prime Minister's spokesperson said that Orban had simply informed Zelenskyy that EU members states were ""continuously negotiating with each other"" regarding Ukraine's possible accession.
Despite what the neutral diplomatic language might suggest, the stakes are high. On Thursday and Friday, EU leaders are gathering in Brussels to discuss plans for a new €50 billion ($54 billion) aid package for Ukraine as well as the opening of formal accession talks. The meeting is set to be tense, however. Hungary has openly threatened to veto them.
At the start of Ukraine's second winter at war, the country finds itself in possibly the most perilous position it has faced since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.
In military terms, the last few months have been defined by attrition rather than territorial gains. In Kyiv, soldiers' wives and relatives recently protested (as have soldiers' families in Russia), demanding combatants be granted a longer break from the frontline after 21 months at war.
Zelenskyy is also reckoning with domestic political critics, not least Mayor of Kyiv Vitaly Klitschko.
And as much of the world's attention has shifted from Ukraine to the fighting in Gaza, the promise of further weapons and aid packages, which are probably vital for Ukraine's survival, is also crumbling.
Against this backdrop, Hungary is now actively taking sides against further military aid. Only a month ago, Orban praised Russia's President Vladimir Putin for ""good relations"".
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis, one of Kyiv's staunchest backers, shared his own interpretation of Orban's behavior on Monday in Brussels.
""The only way I can read the Hungarian position, not just on Ukraine but on many other issues, is that they are against Europe and everything Europe stands for,"" he told reporters.
Markus Kaim, a researcher from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, sees Orban's threats in the run-up to the summit as ""very dangerous"" given that important EU decisions are always made by unanimous agreement.
""If Orban rejects Ukraine's membership prospects, there is little the others can do. So he is controlling the levers, directly and indirectly,"" Kaim told DW.
Ukraine is warning of ""devastating consequences"" in the event of a Hungarian veto. The people of Ukraine would be extremely demotivated if there is no positive decision, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba warned on the sidelines of Monday's meeting with his EU counterparts in Brussels.

At those talks, EU foreign ministers approved a proposal by the European Commission to transfer €900 million to Hungary without preconditions to deal with the energy crisis.
Kaim sees this as an opportunity for concessions to be made. Hungary could also support the next Ukraine aid package at the EU summit at the end of the week.
""They could possibly delay tackling the question of EU accession candidacy for now,"" he suggested
Hungary is also lobbying on a different political stage against assistance payments to Ukraine. According to a report in the British newspaper The Guardian this week, Hungarian diplomats wanted to meet with US Republican Party politicians in Washington this week.
In parallel, Zelenskyy was trying to meet with the head of the Republicans in the House of Congress, Mike Johnson, on Tuesday. Further support for Ukraine depends on Johnson.
After the meeting with Orban, this appointment could be the second uncomfortable debate for Zelenskyy on his diplomatic tour. There are just over 11 months left before the US heads to the polls to select its next president, its House of Representatives and a third of the Senate.
Former president Donald Trump and his supporters in the Republican Party seem to be setting the tone. They are opposed to granting Ukraine massive amounts of aid, as incumbent Democratic President Joe Biden's administration has done.
Biden had already petitioned Congress to release a new tranche in October, but the passage of the budget and approval of a further $61 billion for Ukraine has so far been blocked by the Republicans, who are calling for spending cuts.
Whether Zelenskyy can bring about a change of heart in Washington ― or whether the Republicans will stick to their hard no to Ukraine support ― remains to be seen.
""Then it would be up to Europe,"" said Kaim. ""It would be the first flare-up of what many people fear after Donald Trump's re-election: The US failing as guarantor of the international security order. And then the burden-sharing between the US and Europe would have to be readjusted.""
A definitive ""no"" from the Republicans in Washington or a veto from Hungary at the EU summit would certainly cause headaches for Ukraine. Germany at least is set to double its military aid to Ukraine from €4 billion to €8 billion in 2024, as German Minister of State for Europe Anna Luehrmann announced Monday.

https://www.dw.com/en/berlins-spy-saga-germany-prosecutes-suspected-russian-agent/a-67705601,LAW AND JUSTICE,Berlin's spy saga: Germany prosecutes suspected Russian agent 12.12.2023,"One year after his arrest, Carsten L.* is getting his trial. The former employee of Germany's foreign intelligence service (BND) stands accused of passing along information to the Russian state. 
Suspected treason is never a small affair, but the case comes at a particularly sensitive geopolitical moment. The arrest came in the same year as Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which forced Germany to dramatically curtail its ties with Russia.
Carsten L. will stand before a Berlin court on Wednesday, December 13, along with an accomplice, Arthur E.. They are alleged to have conspired with a businessman in Russia.
German prosecutors say they worked with US federal law enforcement, the FBI, to collect evidence to use against the defendants. They say nine BND documents are at the center of the investigation, which formed the basis of the suspected treasonous activity. 
Checkpoint Charlie was arguably the most famous crossing point between East and West Berlin. It became the scene of a chilling standoff between US and Soviet forces in October 1961, which ended without a single shot fired. Years later, it was revealed that Karl-Heinz Kurras, a West Berlin police officer and undercover spy, had passed information about US troops to the Soviets at the time.







In an effort to collect technical data, Carsten L. allegedly printed out or photographed top-secret material from his computer at the BND's headquarters in Berlin and an offsite location in September and October 2022. Arthur E. is accused of taking that information to Moscow, where he passed it on to Russian intelligence (FSB).
The FSB asked specific questions that were of particular interest, the German indictment says, which Carsten L. and Arthur E. addressed by providing more information.
In the process, they divulged state secrets, prosecutors say, that caused ""particularly serious harm to national security."" 
For their espionage services, Carsten L. and Arthur E. allegedly received €450,000 and at least €400,000 from Russian authorities, respectively ($485,000 and $431,000).
In the year between arrest and trial, the BND has revised the damage the alleged espionage inflicted on German security. It is not as severe as first thought, BND President Bruno Kahl told the German daily, Tagesspiegel.
The leak was ""very manageable"" and ultimately of ""little use"" to Russia, he said.










Given the political backdrop, the revelation of Russian spies in the ranks of German intelligence is not a good look for the BND or the German government more broadly. Staff now have to undergo increased security checks. The BND also has to adapt to a ""security environment in a state of upheaval,"" Kahl told a parliamentary oversight committee in October.
With large-scale and great-power war back in Europe, the BND needs to change course, he told lawmakers.

https://www.dw.com/en/kashmirs-future-in-limbo-after-indian-supreme-court-ruling/a-67704304,POLITICS,Kashmir's future in limbo after Indian Supreme Court ruling 12.12.2023,"A pall of uncertainty hangs over the headquarters of Kashmir's oldest and largest political party, the National Conference, a day after India's Supreme Court supported the 2019 decision by the government that fundamentally transformed constitutional guarantees related to citizenship, land ownership, and employment in the region.
In a unanimous ruling, the five-member bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in 2019 had not overreached its power in withdrawing Kashmir's special status, known as Article 370, calling it a ""temporary provision.""
Tanveer Sadiq, the National Conference's chief spokesperson, described the judgment as disheartening, but vowed to continue to fight for the restoration of Article 370.
""We were hoping for justice for the people of Jammu and Kashmir from the highest court of the country,"" Sadiq told DW.
More than 20 petitions had challenged the controversial abrogation, contesting that the Indian parliament did not have the power to revoke the region's special status, maintaining that only the constituent assembly of Jammu and Kashmir could decide on it.
Article 370 of the Indian constitution had allowed Jammu and Kashmir to have its own constitution and a degree of internal autonomy. Under locally approved laws, this meant that only local Kashmiris could vote, own land, and apply for government jobs.
Kashmiris opposing the move in 2019 also said that scrapping the land ownership provision, called Article 35A, was a move by the BJP to engineer a demographic change in the Muslim-majority region.
Former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti, said that the BJP wants to ""create a different type of demography"" in Kashmir ""by bringing people from outside and settling them here.""

After the decision, the big question for Kashmir observers and regional politicians is how the region will move forward.
Radha Kumar, a former Kashmir interlocutor and a specialist on peace and conflict in South Asia told DW the move ""disregards the democratic right of the affected people to be consulted and only hardens Kashmiri alienation from the union.""
""It will lead to greater insecurity and possibly even violence, not right now but gradually,"" Kumar told DW.
""The militancy died earlier because people were exhausted by conflict and no longer hosted militants. Now, sympathy for militants is likely to return,"" she added.
For decades, Kashmir has been a hotbed of militant violence. Following the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, India responded to the resulting public unrest by sending in paramilitary troops to enforce curfews, while imposing a communications blackout.
In 2019, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had justified removing the special status, in part, by claiming it would bring the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir under control, while boosting economic development.
Anuradha Bhasin, the executive editor of the Kashmir Times newspaper told DW the court's decision has led to ""disappointment and a sense of loss.""
She added there are concerns over maintaining stability because ""Kashmir is a sensitive region with a very disturbing past.""
Former Chief Minister Mufti said that in its decision, India's Supreme Court has ""given a free license to a government with a brute majority to do whatever they want, just demolish whatever is left of the federal structure of the country.""
""It is nothing less than a death sentence not only for Jammu and Kashmir but for the idea of India,"" Mufti said in a five-minute video message posted on social media.
The court also ruled Monday that Jammu and Kashmir should be put on par with other Indian states ""at the earliest and as soon as possible,"" with local elections to take place by September 30 next year.
Navnita Chadha Behera, a political scientist and Kashmir expert, told DW that the verdict could alter the balance of power in the hands of the ruling party, which could potentially alter the federal character of the Indian state.
""To say the Indian parliament can speak for people of any state, and to do in a way that has irreversible implications, is huge,"" she said.
The political landscape in Kashmir, once dominated by regional parties like the National Conference, is now undergoing a seismic shift.
Kashmir political scientist Noor Muhammad Baba said that there is a chance for political forces to be mobilized in Kashmir.
""Once representative voices emerge, once democracy is restored, and people start to politically assert themselves, there will be pressures for certain safeguards, protection for land and jobs. There will be a quest for empowerment,"" he told DW.
Monday's ruling is expected to be a shot in the arm for Modi's BJP ahead of general elections due in May 2024.
Modi called the court judgement ""a beacon of hope, a promise of a brighter future and a testament to our collective resolve to build a stronger, more united India.""
Kashmir BJP minister Priya Sethi said that abrogating Article 370 will ""help in integrating India.""
The provision ""had to go one day and it has gone. This is for the betterment of the nation,"" Sethi said.
Abdul Majeed, a houseboat owner from Srinagar, Kashmir's largest city, called the decision a ""setback.""
""We expected the court to look at the manner Article 370 was taken away and violations committed against the people. But now the government has a license to do what it wants,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-charges-27-suspects-over-reichsb%C3%BCrger-coup-plot/a-67703212,POLITICS,Germany charges 27 suspects over Reichsbürger coup plot 12.12.2023,"For the first time after a series of raids last year, federal prosecutors in Germany on Tuesday brought charges linked to an alleged coup plot hatched by members of the far-right ""Reichsbürger"" movement. 
Authorities in the western city of Karlsruhe said they had charged 26 suspected members of a terrorist organization and a Russian female national accused of supporting it.
Included in the charges, listed on the prosecutors' website, was preparation for an act of high treason.
""The accused are strongly suspected of membership of a terrorist organisation as well as preparation of a treasonous undertaking,"" the prosecutors said in a statement.
Police in several German states arrested 25 suspects last December in the first of a string of raids.
Prosecutors said the circle of suspects was still growing with many of those involved already in custody.
Those now charged include Birgit Malsack-Winkemann, a former member of the German parliament for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Also charged was the entrepreneur and aristocrat Heinrich XIII Prince Reuss, who is alleged to have been the ringleader.
Plans for the coup had evolved to such a degree that branches of a future government had already been allocated.
Malsack Winkemann, a sitting Berlin judge at the time of her arrest, had been earmarked to lead the justice ministry. Reuss was to have become Germany's head of state.
The accused, who also included a former special forces soldier, were said to have wanted to overthrow Germany's political order. They were said to have accepted that this would involve violence and possible deaths.
According to prosecutors, the group made contact with Russian officials seeking to establish a new order in Germany once the Berlin government was overthrown. They also began stockpiling weapons.
Prosecutors said the suspects planned to set up 280 armed units across Germany that would have been tasked with ""arresting and executing"" people after a coup. They planned to break into the Reichstag parliament building in Berlin armed and arrest members of the Bundestag.
The group made numerous concrete preparations for the coup and the subsequent securing of power. The ""Council"" was to serve as the central body of a transitional administration, similar to the cabinet of a regular government. Its job was to negotiate a new state order in Germany with the Allied victorious powers of the Second World War.
In the states of Saxony, Thuringia, and Baden-Württemberg, concrete preparations had already been made.









Prosecutors said the cases would be heard at higher regional courts in Frankfurt, Munich and Stuttgart. The more prominent cases are set to be heard in Frankfurt.
Members of the movement believe deep-state conspiracy theories that deny the existence of Germany's post-World War II Federal Republic and reject the authority of the German government. They claim that the 1937 borders of the German empire still exist.
They were therefore convinced by various conspiracy myths for example that Germany is currently ruled by members of a so-called deep state.
The members believed they would be liberated by a secret alliance that would work with them and give them the signal for ""Day X"" when the coup would be launched.
The non-existent society was said to include governments, intelligence services and militaries of various states, including the Russian Federation and the United States of America.

https://www.dw.com/en/should-germany-be-concerned-over-its-national-debt/a-67695712,BUSINESS,Should Germany be concerned over its national debt? 12.12.2023,"Fear of all-consuming debt is quite widespread in Germany, with recent local media coverage obsessing over the country's debt.
Yet, while Germany faces many problems today, debt is not one of them, writes The Economist, a British magazine.
Discussions on the extent of Germany's debt ensued after the nation's constitutional court ruled that a government plan to repurpose a €60 billion (€65 billion) COVID relief loan was unlawful. Without the necessary cash to make critical investments, the government now must make drastic adjustments to its 2024 budget.
The government could potentially collapse over the question of whether or not the country should continue to take out loans and ignore its debt brake enshrined in the German constitution or reign in state spending.
The underlying fear is that Germany's national debt could become problematic. But when does that become the case? The simple answer could be whenever it becomes expensive for countries.
It can become especially costly when people like Christian Esters, head of the sovereign ratings department at the US rating agency S&P, downgrade Germany's creditworthiness. S&P is regarded as the world's largest and most influential rating agency — ahead of Moody's and Fitch, two other American firms.
The creditworthiness ratings from Esters and his team can have far-reaching consequences. Their assessments determine whether or not states are deemed bankrupt and how much it will cost them to take out fresh loans. The lower their credit rating, the greater the cost of taking out new loans.
Discussions often center on total public debt. In Germany, many are familiar with the Schuldenuhr, or debt clock, which displays the extent of German public debt for everyone to see.
German debt has grown since 1950 and currently stands at €2.5 trillion ($2.68 trillion). This puts Germany in third place in the eurozone, behind France and Italy.
Esters, however, says gross public debt isn't a key metric. ""Absolute government debt is not put in relation to the size of a country's economy, "" he told DW.
Sometimes, the national debt to per capita is discussed instead. In Germany, the national debt per capita currently stands at €31,000 ($33,320).
However, this metric does not help in assessing a country's overall creditworthiness either. Judging by this metric, countries in the global north often appear significantly more indebted than the populous states of the global south. Yet comparing rich and poor nations is also misleading, Esters told DW.
He said that public debt is only one factor considered when conducting a credit rating. ""There are also several other factors, for example, how much of the state budget is spent on paying interest.""
The higher the interest, the more outstanding the debt. Yet interest rates also depend on inflation rates in the sense that central banks try counteracting inflation by raising interest rates.
""Inflation is one of the factors determining the effectiveness and credibility of monetary policy,"" Esters told DW.
Regarding inflation, Germany ranks somewhere in the middle of the pack compared to other countries worldwide. While total global inflation has increased slightly in recent years, it remains moderate compared to the 1980s and 1990s. That said, inflation should be taken seriously.
""High inflation can lead to a drop in purchasing power and reduce [a country's] international competitiveness,"" Esters told DW. As such, inflation is key for determining a country's creditworthiness.
Political factors also impact how much states have to pay for taking out fresh loans, Esters said. ""It is important to emphasize that we do not only take fiscal factors into account,"" he told DW.
""The last few years, in particular, have shown that institutional predictability and stability play an important role. Countries can get into debt crises when their political institutions are weak.""
This can cause a vicious circle. After all, debt can play a crucial role in weakening political institutions. According to S&P, global government debt grew by an average 8% of GDP since the coronavirus pandemic, which has increased pressure on national budgets, especially now that interest rates are high.
""A larger proportion of government revenue has to be spent on interest, and this reduces fiscal flexibility, for example, to react to future shocks or crises,"" Esters said.
Significant government debt does have to equate to low household savings. In Germany, for example, many still save a lot. 
S&P has seen credit ratings improving in 2023, despite immense debt incurred in recent years for coronavirus relief packages, economic restructuring and supporting Ukraine defend itself against Russia. Looking ahead to the coming years, however, things don't look quite so promising.
""We expect more negative than positive credit rating changes in the next one to two years,"" Esters said. The decisive factor, he added, is political risk, not accumulating debt.
Esters is optimistic about Germany's future despite the possibility of new debt. He said even in 2010, when Germany's public debt stood at 80% of GDP, there was no doubt about its creditworthiness, and its rating remained a stellar AAA.

https://www.dw.com/en/is-bangladesh-heading-toward-another-one-sided-election/a-67702685,POLITICS,Is Bangladesh heading toward another 'one-sided' election? 12.12.2023,"Bangladesh's ruling Awami League and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina are set to hold onto power for a fourth consecutive term after the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said it would boycott the polls on January 7, along with several other parties. 
The center-right BNP was the only party that could have offered a realistic challenge to Hasina's fourth consecutive term in power.
The party says its entire leadership, along with thousands of activists, have been arrested over the past five weeks in ""an unprecedented crackdown,"" following a massive BNP rally in the capital, Dhaka, on October 28.
Police say six people, including one police officer, have been killed in violence since the rally.
However, the BNP and other opposition parties have said some 20 activists have been killed. 
BNP legal chief Kayser Kamal said that five people have died in police custody after being arrested in a nationwide crackdown, AFP news agency reported, adding that prison officials said the detainees ""died of natural causes"" and denied BNP claims that detainees were tortured. 
Many of the opposition activists have been arrested on charges of arson attacks and vandalism.
However, the BNP claims the charges were politically motivated. Apart from the arrests, at least nine party members have been sentenced to death, and 925 leaders and activists have been sentenced to various prison sentences in recent weeks on previous charges, the party said.
""These cases are basically trumped up for political purposes. The partisan police registered fictitious cases, citing incidents that never occurred, even against those who have already died or suffered enforced disappearance,"" AKM Wahiduzzaman, a BNP spokesperson, told DW.
He alleged that fictitious police testimony was submitted as sole evidence without any neutral witnesses. 
""These premeditated judgments underscore erosion of the principles of justice, fairness, and the rule of law,"" he added. 
The Awami government has rejected allegations of a crackdown on the opposition parties.
""Our stand is very clear. Those who are involved in acts of sabotage or arson attacks, those who attacked police and killed them, are being dealt with on specific charges. We clearly reject the claim that there has been any crackdown against the opposition party,"" Mohammad A. Arafat, a ruling Awami League party lawmaker, told The Associated Press.
Since becoming Prime Minister in 2009, Sheikh Hasina has overseen massive economic growth, but there has been international alarm over democratic backsliding and thousands of extrajudicial killings of opposition activists. The past two controversial elections marred by allegations of massive vote rigging. 
The CIVICUS Monitor, a Johannesburg-based ""global civil society alliance,"" downgraded Bangladesh's ""civil space"" to ""closed,"" its worst rating, in a report released last week.
""The downgrade is the result of a massive government crackdown on opposition politicians and independent critics in the run-up to national elections next month,"" the watchdog said in its latest report on civic space conditions in 198 countries and territories.
Michael Kugelman, the director of the South Asia Institute at Washington-based Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said it is clear that the BNP decided to boycott the election in part because of a repressive environment that has made it difficult to mount a strong election campaign.
""In the BNP's view, that repressive electoral environment won't go away unless a caretaker government is brought on to oversee the elections. And the party is right on that front,"" he told DW. 
""Unfortunately, we've seen the government exploit many legal tools at its disposal — arrests, convictions, the use of digital security laws, recourse to counterterrorism pretexts — to curb dissent,"" Kugelman said. 
""This has sharpened polarization, infuriated the opposition, and rendered nearly impossible the conditions needed for the multi-party dialogue needed to address a longstanding political crisis — and a crisis that could worsen, not ease, after the election,"" he added. 

Bangladesh had a ""caretaker"" system in place prior to 2011, and it was intended to prevent ruling parties from electoral manipulation and misconduct.
Under that system, when an elected government finished its five-year mandate, a caretaker administration — consisting of civil society representatives — would take control of state institutions for three months and hold elections.
Non-partisan interim administrations conducted general elections in 1996, 2001, and 2008, and the polls were considered free, fair, and inclusive by domestic and international observers.
However, the ruling Awami League  scrapped the system in 2011 following a Supreme Court ruling that the provision was unconstitutional for violating principles of representative democracy.
BNP spokesman AKM Wahiduzzaman said that his BNP party would only participate in the January national election under a non-partisan neutral government. But the Hasina government has rejected that demand.
Jasmin Lorch, a senior researcher at the German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS), said that none of the parties participating in the January election can truly be considered an opposition party. 
""They are either aligned with the Awami League party or present themselves as opposition parties but are, in fact, close to the [Awami] party,"" she told DW. 
""There is a relatively big consensus in the US and Europe already now that the elections are unlikely to be free and fair,"" she added. 
Lorch said the European Union decided after an exploratory mission to Bangladesh that it would not field an election observation mission in January because the ""conditions for a free and fair election did not seem to be in place.""
South Asia expert Kugelman said it is ""hard to imagine any outcome other than a one-sided affair.""
""Unless the BNP reverses its boycott, the Awami League gives way to a caretaker, or some other non-BNP electoral alliance emerges to successfully take on the Awami League — and let's be clear that those are all next-to-impossible scenarios — the Awami League appears headed to a lopsided victory without meaningful opposition,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-cdu-redefines-stance-on-islam-in-new-manifesto/a-67702793,POLITICS,Germany's CDU redefines stance on Islam in new manifesto 12.12.2023,"The new color scheme a few months back was only a cosmetic step. Now, Germany's center-right Christian Democrats are going under the hood. For the first time since 2007, the party that ruled Germany for most of the republic's young history has revamped its party program.
Its leaders hope this is their ticket to returning to power, which they lost in 2021. In establishing what the CDU now stands for, the draft reflects ideological differences at the very top. Chairman Friedrich Merz needed three attempts to become party leader, rebuffed by a skeptical Angela Merkel when she was still chancellor and a powerful force in the party. With her gone and Merz in charge since early last year, he is seeking a different path.
It leads the CDU towards a more traditional, center-right landscape, reorienting the party on a range of issues, namely energy, immigration and paying particular attention to Germany's Muslim community. 
Merkel spent many of her almost 16 years in power in a ""grand coalition"" with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD). In that period, political circles joked that she had ""social democratized"" the Christian Democrats. Under Merz, the CDU has repeatedly raked the Social Democrats over the coals.

""We would be ready if there are early elections,"" Carsten Linnemann, the CDU secretary general, told reporters on Monday.
Such a scenario is not unthinkable. Both the government coalition and its chancellor, the SPD's Olaf Scholz, face dismal polling prospects. The far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) is surging to all-time highs. The economy appears sluggish, and a budget crisis remains without a clear solution. 
The CDU is positioning itself as the answer to Germany's woes. The draft envisions a return to nuclear power, which Germany has phased out, as part of the answer to reliable, affordable energy that complies with climate targets.
That claim is disputed by some economists, especially as renewable sources such as wind and solar have come down in price. Claudia Kemfert, who leads the Energy, Transportation and Environment Department at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), called the CDU program in this regard ""regressive.""
""Nuclear energy is a technology of the past, not the future. It is too expensive, the construction of the plants takes decades, the innovation potential is low and the risks are high,"" she told DW in a statement.  ""Even the operators themselves no longer want it. Nuclear power is not competitive without high subsidies.""
Gas-powered plants, which the CDU has also called for, need to be phased out by 2035, she added.
The CDU would ""put a stop to uncontrolled immigration and limit humanitarian migration to a level that does not overburden Germany's integration capacity,"" the draft reads.
The policy would shift the asylum process to third countries deemed safe, and settle applicants there. While CDU officials consider such changes a way to ""uphold our humanitarian responsibilities,"" asylum advocates consider it a cynical effort to undermine the rule of law.
""Asylum procedures outside the EU disguise the desire to keep refugees at bay,"" Stephan Dünnwald, an advisor for the Bavarian Refugee Council, told DW in a statement.
He called the CDU's asylum position a ""departure from the lessons learned by society and the international community after 1945.""
It was a CDU-led government that permitted around one million, mostly-Muslim asylum seekers to enter Germany in 2015. That sense of openness, which Germany was widely praised for, was already getting dialed back with Merkel still in power. There is even less appetite for it now — not only from the CDU, but across much of the German political spectrum.
Gone are the days of recognizing that ""Islam now belongs to Germany, too"" as the CDU's Christian Wulff said when he served as Germany's president during an early Merkel government. The new draft manifesto adds a key caveat: Muslims belong to Germany so long as they ""share our values.""
Since the 1960s, Germany has been home to a substantial Muslim population — now more than five million people — yet structural hurdles have made establishing homegrown religious institutions difficult. That has contributed to a reliance on imams and Islamic education from abroad, feeding suspicions about ""foreign influence"" that the CDU wants to see stopped.
The shift to the right is partly an effort to win over supporters of the AfD, but critics see the risk of that strategy backfiring.
""Cheating off AfD schoolwork wasn't particularly smart,"" Aiman Mazyek, the head of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany, told Stern magazine. ""Experience shows that voters will ultimately go with the original.""

The draft manifesto is only one piece of the CDU's pushback on migration and Germany's Muslim minority. It has used the attack by the Islamist Palestinian militant group Hamas on Israel in October as the backdrop to legislative proposals that accelerate deportations and could deny or strip citizenship under certain circumstances. The European Union as well as the United States, Germany and several other countries classify Hamas as a terrorist organization.
The CDU's reservations on immigration come at a time when the Bundestag, Germany's parliament, has passed immigration reform that aims to boost the import of skilled labor at a time when economists and demographers have been ringing alarm bells about massive labor shortages in the near future. Merz's focus on Islamist and imported extremism misses what law enforcement regularly reports is a bigger threat: domestic white supremacist groups. 
A CDU that once campaigned on a ""Germany in which you can live well and gladly"" is now promising a better chance at ""living in freedom,"" as the manifesto is titled. As a draft, the document is subject to change before party members vote on it next year. 
Merz himself has struggled with popularity, polls suggest, among the general public and within his own party.

https://www.dw.com/en/espionage-germany-cases/a-66496986,POLITICS,Espionage in Germany: The most spectacular spy cases 12.12.2023,"The high-profile case of Carsten L.* goes to court this week.
He was responsible for ""personnel security"" as head of division at Germany's international secret service (BND), but he is suspected of being a security risk himself.
The former Bundeswehr officer now stands accused of having worked as a double agent for the FSB, Russia's secret service. L. is said to have passed on secret documents to the businessman Arthur E., who then handed them over to the FSB. L. is said to have been paid €450,000 ($484,000) and E. at least €400,000 for this. Prosecutors now suggest the betrayal of secrets could have enabled the Russian FSB to draw conclusions on Germany's espionage methods.
Carsten L. and his accomplice Arthur E. are now on trial in Berlin. They face a life sentence if they are convicted of particularly serious treason. 
The Russian war against Ukraine ""also means a turning point for internal security,"" German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said in June 2023, warning of a new wave of disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks, and espionage by foreign intelligence services.
At the beginning of August, there was another case in point.

Thomas H. was arrested on August 9 in the western city of Koblenz when the federal prosecutor's office accused the Bundeswehr officer of having betrayed information about military details to Russian intelligence.
The Berlin daily Tagesspiegel reported that Thomas H. had already come to the attention of his colleagues because of his sympathy for the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD). Some parts of the party are considered far-right extremists and very critical of the NATO alliance's attempts to help Ukraine against Russian aggression.
But it is not only since the Russian invasion of Ukraine that spies in Germany have been reporting to Moscow. Beginning sometime in the 1980s, two Russian agents led a middle-class life under the names of Andreas and Heidrun Anschlag, he posing as an engineer, she as a housewife.
They spied on NATO and the European Union, first for the Soviet Union and then for the Russian secret service. They received their orders via encrypted radio messages on shortwave at a time when espionage was not yet a predominantly digital business. It was not until 2011 that their cover was blown — probably thanks to a tip-off from US intelligence services. In 2013, they were sentenced to several years in prison and eventually deported to Russia.
The communist German Democratic Republic (GDR) referred to their agents as ""scouts of peace."" An estimated 12,000 of them are believed to have been deployed by the East German secret service, the Staatssicherheitsdienst or Stasi, to West Germany during the Cold War.
Among them was Gabriele Gast, a West German recruited by a Stasi officer in 1968 while on a research trip to East Germany for her dissertation entitled: ""The Political Role of Women in the GDR."" From then on, Gast reported to the intelligence service in East Germany — while also making a career for herself at the Western intelligence service BND under a false name. She was only exposed after the collapse of the GDR in 1989, shortly before the reunification of Germany. She is still considered to have been one of the GDR's top spies in the West.
Alfred Spuhler may have been a similarly good source for the Stasi. As a high-ranking BND official, he unmasked hundreds of Western agents working in the GDR. He was arrested in November 1989.
Heinz Felfe, the longtime head of the BND's ""Counterintelligence Soviet Union"" unit, was also a double agent. He was a member of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler's police unit, Schutzstaffel (SS), then reported to the KGB in Moscow until 1961. Over the years, Felfe is believed to have worked for seven different intelligence services, including the British MI6.
Probably the most sensational espionage case from the Cold War period in Germany is that of Günter Guillaume.
Posing as refugees from East Germany, he and his wife Christel came to West Germany in 1956. Their mission was to provide the Stasi with internal information about the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). Guillaume worked his way up, eventually becoming personal advisor to Chancellor Willy Brandt when the SPD came to power.
When Guillaume's cover was blown, Brandt was forced to resign as chancellor on May 6, 1974. Guillaume was sentenced to 13 years in prison and his wife to eight years. Both were released in 1981 in exchange for West German agents.
A vast number of Stasi spies were exposed after the fall of the Wall. Not much is known about Western agents in the GDR, with the notable exception of Elli Barczatis and Karl Laurenz, who smuggled GDR documents to the West at the beginning of the Cold War in the early 1950s.
Barczatis worked as chief secretary to GDR Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl. She obtained rather banal government papers that she passed to her lover Karl Laurenz, who handed them over to West German authorities. When this was discovered, both Barczatis and Laurenz were sentenced to death in East Germany and executed by guillotine in 1955.

https://www.dw.com/en/teacher-shortage-crisis-hits-germanys-schools/a-67695258,EDUCATION,Teacher shortage crisis hits Germany's schools 12.12.2023,"For more than 30 years, Rebecca* has been teaching at a high school near Hamburg. Her subjects are English and history.
German, math and English are classified as ""core subjects"" and prioritized for instruction. When staffing falls short, other subjects such as history classes are canceled — sometimes for months at a time.
""We are always understaffed,"" said Rebecca. ""The school administration can't fill vacancies and often my co-workers are out sick for weeks or even months because they're burned out from overwork.""
The result is cuts in the curriculum. Some schools have resorted to a four-day week for classes. Across Germany, tens of thousands more teachers are needed. No one knows the exact number the school system is missing.
In Germany's federalized system, education falls under the authority of the 16 regional states. The resulting differences in the kinds of schools, in curricula and teachers' workloads make it difficult to compare the situation and gain an overview for the whole of Germany.

The Education Ministers' Conference, the body of the 16 state education ministers who attempt to coordinate education policies, estimates that 14,000 full-time teaching positions are currently vacant.
Economists, education researchers and the GEW teachers' union all consider that figure too low. ""By 2035, the gap in the supply and demand of teachers will grow to 56,000 full-time positions,"" said Anja Bensinger-Stolze, who heads up GEW. She bases that conclusion on a GEW study released in September, which forecast that the total number of vacant teaching positions in Germany's schools, including part time, could reach half a million by 2035.
Germany's statistics office has calculated that the 830,000 children who started school in 2023 represent the highest number of children starting school in 20 years.
The rise is partly due to higher birth rates, but especially because of increased immigration to Germany. The situation is set to become even more acute in 2026, when a legal right to full-day supervision takes effect for elementary school children.
A university degree is required to become a teacher. Education programs are financed by the respective regional states, but an education degree qualifies the holder to teach anywhere in Germany, so there is competition between the states to attract more teachers.
For many years, politicians have taken advantage of this system to cut costs, said Bensinger-Stolze. ""For years, nearly all regional states have been training fewer teachers than they were projected to need. Each one has been counting on the others,"" she said.
As demand grows more urgent, schools have increasingly been recruiting people from other professions who have no educational training. Meanwhile, with the teaching career growing increasingly unattractive, many university students have been abandoning teaching programs.
Recommendations by the Education Ministers' Conference to fight the shortfall could actually make things worse. That's largely because their recommendations include more hours of instruction and higher retirement ages and would restrict part-time work as much as possible.
And yet, year after year, increasing numbers of teachers are choosing to work part time. Today, some 40% of all teachers in Germany are employed on a part-time basis. One of them is Rebecca, who officially teaches 23.5 periods a week instead of the standard 25.
""Actual teaching, preparation and adjustment, correcting tests and exams — despite my years of experience, it all totals more than 40 hours a week,"" she said.
In general, working conditions have deteriorated substantially in recent years. Class sizes have grown and instruction is taking up more of teachers' time.
""We have more pupils from other countries who need more attention because they don't get as much support at home,"" said Rebecca.


Maintaining discipline in class has also taken a new turn. ""I don't let myself be put off when a pupil with a Muslim background tells me they won't take orders from me,"" said Rebecca. ""But sometimes I hear the same thing from parents! And that overwhelms many young co-workers, who have just started their teaching careers and see their authority clearly being challenged.""
The GEW union has laid out a 15-point plan to keep more teachers in the profession while making it more attractive to others. The plan calls for fewer working hours for teachers, smaller classes and better health protection and support systems.
These systems would include interdisciplinary teams in which teachers collaborate with social workers, day care workers and psychologists, as well as interpreters and teachers who speak the languages of migrant children.
""We have long been demanding better and faster recognition for education degrees acquired abroad,"" said Bensinger-Stolze, referencing the rise in Ukrainian refugees.
Teachers in Germany must be qualified to teach more than one subject. Foreign teachers, for example those from Ukraine, often teach only one subject. For this reason, Ukrainian teachers have so far had no chance to start working in German schools.
Yet the GEW holds out little hope that the situation in Germany's schools will change any time soon.

https://www.dw.com/en/rina-gonoi-japan-soldiers-found-guilty-of-sexual-assault/a-67697008,LAW AND JUSTICE,Rina Gonoi: Japan soldiers found guilty of sexual assault 12.12.2023,"A court in Japan on Tuesday found three former soldiers guilty of sexually assaulting a female colleague and gave them suspended jail terms.
The case of 24-year-old Rina Gonoi relates to a 2021 incident during her time in the army.
After joining the Japanese Self Defense Forces in 2020, she said she experienced daily harassment.
""When walking down the hallway, someone slaps you on your hip, or holds you from behind,"" she told AFP. ""I was kissed on the cheek, and my breasts were grabbed.""
And then in 2021, during a drill, she said three of her colleagues pinned her to the ground, forced her legs apart and pressed their crotches against her in simulation of a sex act. She said other colleagues present at the time watched and laughed.
Even though she complained to her superiors at the time, no action was taken, prompting Gonoi to leave the military.
In 2022, Gonoi took to YouTube to share her account.
After she went public, Japan's Defense Ministry issued a public apology to her and announced that five men connected to the incident had been dismissed and four others punished.
Gonoi's decision to go public also grabbed public attention and put a spotlight on the issue of sexual assault and harassment in a society where women rarely hold positions in the upper echelons of politics, business and military.
It also inspired others to file complaints about sexual harassment and bullying.
In the military, for instance, over 1,400 women and men have submitted their allegations following a special inspection by the Defense Ministry.
This June, Japan passed legislation redefining rape, including removing the requirement that victims prove they had sought to resist their attacker.

Gonoi's battle has even attracted international recognition: Time Magazine named her on its list of 100 emerging world leaders while the British Broadcasting Corp included her among its 100 most influential women globally.
But she has also been a target of online vitriol.
""I have gotten many derogatory comments. But I know the world values what I'm doing,"" she told Reuters.
Separately, Gonoi has lodged a civil case against her former peers and the government, seeking damages for the alleged assault and the subsequent inaction despite her complaints.

https://www.dw.com/en/russia-navalnys-team-says-whereabouts-unknown/a-67695549,HUMAN RIGHTS,Russia: Navalny's team says whereabouts unknown 11.12.2023,"Allies of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said Monday they have been unable to locate him for six days and that he has likely been transferred.
Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, said staff at the penal colony where he has been held since the middle of last year told his lawyer that the opposition leader was no longer among the inmates. Prison officials ""refuse to say where they transferred him,"" she said in posts on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Navalny has been behind bars since January 2021. He is serving a 19-year sentence on extremism charges at a maximum-security prison, Penal Colony No. 6, in the town of Melekhovo in the Vladimir region, about 230 kilometers (140 miles) east of Moscow.
The opposition leader's allies believe he was taken out of the Vladimir region. ""He can be anywhere,"" said Leonid Volkov, another Navalny ally.
Navalny was to be transferred to a ""special security"" penal colony, the highest security facility in the Russian penal system. Navalny could be transferred to one of several such penal colonies across Russia.
In Russia's vast prison system, it often takes weeks or even months to transfer prisoners between distant facilities by rail. During the transfer, there's no access to the prisoners, and information about their whereabouts is limited or unavailable.
Navalny's contact with the outside world has been severely restricted in recent months, and he has been in and out of isolation cells this year.

The United States is concerned after allies of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said they had received no news of him or his whereabouts recently, the White House said. 
""We're deeply concerned by these reports that he's now been gone for allegedly a week and neither his representatives or his family know where he is,"" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. ""He should be released immediately, he should never have been jailed in the first place.""
A fierce opponent of President Vladimir Putin, Navalny campaigned against corruption and organized large anti-Kremlin protests. He was arrested on his return to Moscow from Germany, where he was recovering from nerve-agent poisoning that he blamed on the Kremlin.
Navalny has since been sentenced to three jail terms and spent months in isolation in the penal colony for alleged minor offenses. He has denied all charges against him as politically motivated.

https://www.dw.com/en/israel-conflict-can-hamas-really-be-completely-eliminated/a-67692070,CONFLICTS,Israel conflict: Can Hamas really be completely 'eliminated'? 11.12.2023,"The Israeli government has been clear. The militant group Hamas will be ""eliminated,"" many senior members of government, including the country's prime minister, have all said.
On certain Israeli television channels, slogans such as ""Together we will win"" appear regularly. But is it really possible to completely eliminate Hamas and ""win"" in a situation like this?
The short answer, as experts have repeatedly said, is no.
Israel has been bombing the Gaza Strip, home to more than two million Palestinians, since the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, which is classified as a terrorist organization by Germany, the European Union, the US and others. Israel has also launched a ground offensive into the Gaza Strip and is blocking the delivery of food, water and power into the enclave.
Despite this, most analysts say that it won't be possible to get rid of Hamas altogether, the main reason being that Hamas is more than just a militant organization.
Hamas has an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 fighters, Guido Steinberg, an expert on the Middle East at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told DW recently. But, he added, ""it is also a social movement with mass support in the Gaza Strip. And that is the problem in the long run.""
Hamas has been in de facto control of the Gaza Strip since 2007, and as part of its social movement, there is a welfare network known as ""dawah."" This civilian network is thought to have between 80,000 and 90,000 members.
Dawah means ""call"" or ""invitation"" and is historically defined as a way of calling or inviting more believers to one's faith through social outreach, the Oxford Dictionary of Islam explains.
Isreal ""would love to eradicate Hamas as an institution, as a political, religious and cultural structure, and as a military structure,"" Rashid Khalidi, a professor of modern Arab studies at Columbia University in New York told the Spanish newspaper El Pais, in late October.
""I don't think they can do the first two things,"" he argued. ""Whether they kill all their leaders, whether they kill all the armed militants, Hamas will remain as a political force, whether the Israelis occupy Gaza or leave. So destroying Hamas as a political institution, destroying Hamas as an idea, is impossible.""
Hamas does not recognize the state of Israel. The group believes that religion should be the basis of any Palestinian government. But it is probably its self-described position as a resistance movement opposed to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories and the Gaza Strip that makes it most popular. 
However, Khalidi added, what the Israelis may well be able to do is degrade Hamas' military capabilities, ""but only to a limited extent and period.""
Israel has one of the most powerful militaries in the world, ranking 18th out of 145 nations in 2023 on Global Firepower's annual list of armed strength. For comparison, Germany sits in 25th place. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute reports that last year Israel spent 4.5% of its national income on defense — that's more than the US or Germany, which spent 3.5% and 1.4% respectively.
Meanwhile, Hamas' military wing operates more like a guerilla group and has smuggled most of its weapons into the Gaza Strip.
So Israel certainly has the resources to degrade Hamas and hunt down its leaders. Although the numbers cannot be independently verified, the Israeli government said recently it believes it has killed between 5,000 and 7,000 Hamas fighters. 
If true, this could be seen as a partial success because weakening Hamas may well be the best that can be expected. ""Some Western officials believe that the Israeli offensive to date, combined with upgraded border security, has made sure that Hamas will not launch another attack like that of 7 October,"" experts at the think tank International Crisis Group wrote last week.
""As Hamas did after conflicts with Israel in 2009, 2012, 2014 and 2021, the group will almost certainly rearm and restore,"" Dennis Ross, a former US envoy to the Middle East, wrote in an op-ed for the New York Times in late October. That is why, he explained, he was against a ceasefire until Hamas had been removed from power.
At the same time, very few national militaries have managed to decisively defeat guerilla organizations in the past.
Unsuccessful examples include the US efforts against the Taliban in Afghanistan and insurgent groups in Iraq. The Sri Lankan government's defeat of the separatist rebel group Tamil Tigers in that nation's civil war is often cited as a case where a national army did win. But, as is also often pointed out, that victory took 26 years of war, a death toll of between 80,000 to 100,000, and potential war crimes committed by both sides.
In fact, in some situations where an insurgent group's capabilities were degraded but it managed to survive, the group re-emerged later in a more extremist form. A common example is the brutal ""Islamic State"" group, which evolved out of the remnants of Al-Qaida.
Israel itself has never managed to defeat Hamas conclusively, despite assassinating a number of its leaders, including two founders of the group.

""The [Israeli] military can do the best job they can. They could eliminate the leadership. They can destroy missile launching facilities,"" Justin Crump, a terrorism expert who heads Sibylline Ltd, a global intelligence and risk analysis consultancy, said. ""But they won't eliminate the idea of Hamas.""
Destroying Hamas by military means makes no sense, Crump told DW, because ""while some Gazans are turning against Hamas, other people in Gaza sympathize with Hamas. They will resent Israel for these actions, and that is going to fuel the cycle [of violence] as it always has done — unless there is a very big change at the end of this.""
""After more than two months of intense Israeli operations, it is evident that eradicating Hamas, even as a fighting force, will be a tall order and the push to do so will destroy what is left of Gaza,"" a policy briefing by the think tank International Crisis Group, or ICS, published on December 9, concluded.
According to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, over 18,000 people have been killed by Israel and over 49,500 injured in just two months; an estimated 61% of those killed are civilians, according to an analysis by Yagil Levy, a sociology professor at the Open University of Israel and cited by Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Over half of all Gaza's buildings have been destroyed, and 90% of the population is now displaced.  
""Netanyahu claims that Hamas's destruction will enable the 'deradicalization' of Gaza, but the opposite is likely,"" ICS experts wrote. ""The campaign underway and its aftermath will produce new, perhaps still more tenacious forms of militancy.""

https://www.dw.com/en/polish-parliament-elects-donald-tusk-as-prime-minister/a-67685184,POLITICS,Polish parliament elects Donald Tusk as prime minister 11.12.2023,"Poland's new parliament elected centrist party leader Donald Tusk as prime minister on Monday. Tusk becomes prime minister nearly two months after national elections won by a coalition of parties ranging from left-wing to moderately conservative.
The alliance of pro-EU parties signed an agreement last month, paving the way for a coalition government.
Earlier on Monday, the parliament rejected the proposed conservative government of acting Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, a widely expected outcome that paved the way for the rival alliance to form the next government.
Only 190 deputies voted in favor of the Morawiecki government, while 266 voted against it and there were no abstentions.
Morawiecki's Law and Justice (PiS) party lost its majority but retained its status as the largest single party in October's elections.
Morawiecki's failure opens the door for former Polish Prime Minister and former European Council President Donald Tusk.
Tusk led a broad pro-EU opposition coalition in a bid to unseat PiS after two terms in power.

The decision on who to nominate for the first shot at forming a government after an election rests with Poland's president, Andrzej Duda, previously a PiS ally. 
Duda nominated Morawiecki and PiS, despite them not commanding a majority, saying it was customary to give this chance to the largest party.
Morawiecki's caretaker government was technically sworn in, but under Polish rules it had to win a vote of confidence within two weeks to cement its position.
Tusk, Polish prime minister from 2007 to 2014 and then European Council president from 2014 to 2019, returned to front-line Polish politics as leader of his pro-European, centrist Civic Coalition in 2021. 
PiS has had a fraught relationship with the European Union since 2015, frequently in dispute with Brussels. 
Tusk has pledged to rebuild relations with Brussels on returning to power in Warsaw, partly with an eye to securing the release of EU funds that were frozen amid an ongoing standoff over the rule of law in Poland.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-road-deaths-expected-to-fall-in-2023/a-67690589,CARS AND TRANSPORTATION,Germany: Road deaths expected to fall in 2023 11.12.2023,"The number of people dying in accidents on Germany's roads looked set to once again fall in 2023, according to data from Germany's national statistics agency, Destatis, published on Monday.
The country saw a historic low in road deaths in 2021 when there were just 2,562 fatalities.
According to estimates based on data from January to September, the number of people expected to die in road traffic accidents was expected to fall in 2023 from the level in 2022.
Destatis estimated that the total number of road deaths in 2023 would reach 2,750 for the year, 40 fewer than the previous year.
The figure is above the historic low of 2,562 in 2021, but well below the pre-pandemic level of 3,062.
Traffic on the roads has generally decreased since the COVID-19 lockdown, accident researcher Siegfried Brockmann told the DPA news agency.
This, he said, was because many more people were avoiding commutes by working from home and with video conferences replacing much business travel.
About 360,000 were expected to be injured in road accidents this year, roughly the same as in 2022.
However, Destatis forecast more than 2.5 million crashes and accidents on German roads for the first time since 2019 — about 4% more than in 2022.
Destatis figures show a dramatic reduction in the number of road deaths over the past decades.
The agency has been recording road accidents since as long ago as 1952, including both West Germany and the former East Germany.
By the mid-50s, the number of annual road deaths stood at around 14,000, before spiking in 1970 at 21,000.
Since then, the number of road deaths has sunk dramatically, thanks in no small part to changes in the law.
New legislation lowered speed limits on some roads and made it compulsory for drivers to wear seatbelts and motorcyclists to wear helmets. The law was also altered to bring down the legal limit for blood-alcohol content while driving.
Technical safety specifications in vehicles have also dramatically improved throughout the same period.

https://www.dw.com/en/deutsche-bahn-bosses-pick-up-bonuses-as-passengers-suffer/a-67691505,BUSINESS,Deutsche Bahn bosses pick up bonuses as passengers suffer 11.12.2023,"In the wake of the GDL railroad union's most recent strike for better wages and working conditions, a report has emerged claiming that the top management of Germany's rail operator, Deutsche Bahn, will apparently receive bonuses totaling almost €5 million ($5.4 million) for 2022.
This was divulged on Monday by public broadcasters NDR, WDR and daily Süddeutsche Zeitung who said they had access to Deutsche Bahn's long-term calculation model for bonuses.
Bonuses are meant to be an award for good performance. But many long-suffering rail customers will be scratching their heads in amazement and wondering how that's possible, given Deutsche Bahn's long list of problems.
The trick, it appears, is to offset areas in which targets have been missed against other areas in which targets have been exceeded. It means the basic salaries of the nine members of the executive will rise from a total of around €4 million to around €9 million in 2022.
According to the report, Deutsche Bahn only slightly exceeded its own targets in the area of ""women in leadership and employee satisfaction"" in 2022. However, the bonus was up by 175%, says the report. The executive board members stand to rake in around €1.6 million for this target alone.
The documents also show that Deutsche Bahn exceeded its self-imposed target for CO2 savings by 2%, the investigative network reported. CEO Richard Lutz, for example, is said to have received almost €440,000 in bonus payments.
According to the report, the bonus system looks set to be revamped next year. Deutsche Bahn board members would then receive a higher proportion of their salary as a fixed salary, while the proportion of bonuses would be reduced.
Deutsche Bahn's supervisory board, which includes federal government and trade union representatives, sets the parameters of the bonus system.
A number of rail lines around Bavaria's state capital, Munich, were closed during the heavy onset of winter. In Ulm and Munich, stranded passengers spent Friday night in trains, with the Munich Central Station inaccessible for hours. National rail provider Deutsche Bahn said delays would last into Monday.










In future, meeting targets will have less relevance for the rail bosses' salaries. Whether a train is running late, is canceled or overbooked will also have less of an impact. Other problems like trains stopping ""indefinitely"" mid-route, air conditioning systems failing in midsummer or the app failing to show alternatives and delays will play less of a role in determining their salaries.
Germany's national train system has a lot of room for improvement, not least concerning the punctuality of long-distance trains. Last year, every third train was more than six minutes late. The situation was better on regional services, where just under a tenth of regional trains failed to reach their destination on time.
The issue of trains not running on time is a major grievance for passengers. Factoring in delays means they must adapt their travel plans accordingly to avoid missing connecting trains or appointments. That puts off a lot of potential passengers, at a time when Deutsche Bahn needs to find ways of squaring the circle to attract more customers and increase train freight volume if it wants to achieve its climate targets by 2030.
""Today's unpunctuality is the result of 20 years of misguided transport and rail policy,"" said Christian Böttger, professor of industrial engineering at the Berlin University of Applied Sciences. In the last 20 years, investment in rail infrastructure has been cut back, while at the same time more trains have been running.
""The network is simply overloaded,"" said Böttger. In contrast to Luxembourg and Switzerland, which invested around €575 per capita and €450 per capita in rail infrastructure respectively, the figure in Germany is just €114.
For the majority of Germans, mobility means traveling by car, and that guides politicians' policies.
In addition, for the past 15 years Deutsche Bahn has steadfastly maintained that its rail network infrastructure is in good working order. A recent report, however, struck a different tone, observing that the network was ""old"" and ""prone to faults.""
""That's a huge scandal,"" said Böttger. ""The federal government has spent millions to check these figures again and has always confirmed that the network is in a great condition.""
He points out that there is no inquiry committee and that no one is asking whether the management and supervisory boards should be held accountable.
In an effort to improve its image, Deutsche Bahn is planning a refurbishment program worth billions of euros, with the aim of restoring heavily used sections of the rail network. Ultimately, Deutsche Bahn wants to have a high-performance network in place by 2030. This would involve improving 40 routes to ensure more reliability and a higher frequency of trains.
""We are now facing a historic turning point,"" said Pro-Rail Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy organization for the improvement of rail transport. The government coalition in Berlin wants to significantly increase investment in rail infrastructure in the budget for 2024.
""There is significantly more money than before; that is the good news,"" said Böttger. However, a large part of this money is needed to mitigate the impact of high inflation, he added.
In addition, the government had promised an extra €45 billion by 2027 ""and now only around half is being provided by the federal government from the budget and climate protection fund,"" said Böttger.

The money will be used to renovate the high-speed railway lines, but will not be enough to build new lines. Böttger does not expect these measures to improve punctuality, as they don't tackle the basic problem of overloaded networks.
The government has earmarked €90 billion as a priority to build new lines. In addition, a further €50 billion are needed for the so-called Deutschlandtakt, a project that would connect Germany's major cities with trains running at least every hour. Another €30 billion would have to be pumped into freight transport, which has long been running a deficit.
""But there is no overview of the actual figures,"" said Böttger. ""And I don't think the government wants there to be an overview either, because the result would be somewhat embarrassing, as it would show that the political goals are not financially viable.""
To make matters worse, there are not enough planners and construction companies to carry out the refurbishment work, he added.
For years, experts have recommended splitting up Deutsche Bahn so that the rail network and operations are managed by different companies.
However, Transport Minister Volker Wissing, of the neoliberal Free Democrats, is not impressed by the idea. He's planning a new infrastructure company which would focus on the maintenance and expansion of the rail network separately from rail operations. This company is due to start work on January 1, 2024.
Other countries, such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and the UK, have found a way to make the separation of network and operations work. ""But it's not a magic solution,"" cautioned Böttger.
Rail customers should not expect an improvement in rail travel anytime soon. On the contrary, things will get worse before they get better, as busy routes will have to be shut down completely at times for maintenance and refurbishment.
""In view of the list of problems and the visible solutions, I doubt that the railroad's accumulated problems can really be resolved in the next 10 years,"" said Böttger.

https://www.dw.com/en/south-africas-ambitious-energy-transition-can-it-shift-away-from-coal/a-67669303,POLITICS,South Africa's ambitious energy transition: Can it shift away from coal? 11.12.2023,"As this year's COP28 slowly draws to a close, world leaders have gathered in Dubai to deliberate over climate issues. This includes an eventual end to the burning of fossil fuels.
Now South Africa finds itself under pressure to begin a phase-out of its almost 100% reliance on coal for generating energy. It is estimated that this will come at a huge cost, including the loss of jobs.
President Cyril Ramaphosa recently delivered the country's so-called ""Just Energy Transition Implementation Plan"" , which has an estimated cost of €24 billion ($25 billion) to be spread across solar, wind and battery storage projects.
The plan outlines exactly how South Africa will reduce its dependence on coal, acquire new sources of renewable energy and build new industries and jobs for affected communities and workers.
However, President Ramaphosa told reporters on the sidelines of the climate change summit that South Africa would require external help to afford it.
""We are calling for more countries to participate as our energy transition requires much more money, so that we can transit in a much more effective way and in a just way, particularly when it comes to those communities that are going to be affected."" Ramaphosa said.

South Africa's plan to scale down its use of coal comes at a significant cost to its labor market.
A significant portion of the economy of Mpumalanga province in the country's east relies on coal mining and coal power stations. Removing coal from the equation effectively means Mpumalanga's economy will need to be reconstructed.
The country's car assembly plants will also require billions of euros of investment to make the switch to electric car production.
With the implementation of the plan looming, labor unions are now scrambling to secure the futures of their workers. Phakamile Hlubi-Majola, the spokesperson of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa told DW they want full guarantees that the implementation of the plan will protect livelihoods. 
""The process should benefit the maximum number of people in the country,"" he said.
""It should protect the maximum number of jobs.""

However, Leo Roberts from the think tank E3G said South Africa's entire economy is being dragged down by an ""over-reliance"" on ageing coal plants.
""Coal power isn't providing reliable electricity, there are rolling blackouts,"" he said.
""It's incredibly expensive and the state utility that runs the power system Eskom is so debt-saddled that it can't borrow money.""
The country's power utility Eskom is currently struggling to generate enough electricity for the country. Eskom, which currently employs around 30,000 workers, would need to retrain many of them in order to remain relevant in the renewable energy sector.
Energy analyst Adil Nchabeleng says South Africa's energy conundrum has left it between a rock and a hard place, adding that its pledges at COP28 are still going to clash with its existing energy situation.
""We are a coal-based country that specializes in coal-fired power stations and we need to make sure that those power stations will carry us to the next 20 years minimum and make sure that we produce electricity that we require,"" he said.
But in the long run, the South African government sees light at the end of the tunnel. Concession loans and grant pledges made by international partners to support the transition phase now stand at just over €10 billion.
While the energy transition plan is expected to shed up to 300,000 jobs, the government says it is expected to create up to 815,000 jobs by 2050.

https://www.dw.com/en/chinas-xi-heads-to-vietnam-after-hanoi-boosts-us-japan-ties/a-67689978,CONFLICTS,"China's Xi heads to Vietnam after Hanoi boosts US, Japan ties 11.12.2023","China's leader Xi Jinping is set to travel to Vietnam this week to meet Nguyen Phu Trong, the general secretary of the smaller country's ruling Communist party. The two Asian nations are close — bilateral trade is growing and the two authoritarian regimes share a mutual understanding and a common political ideology.  
""Hanoi will roll out the red carpet for Xi Jinping,"" said Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington who focuses on Southeast Asian politics and security.
""China awarded general secretary Nguyen Phu Trong their highest award for foreigners last November. I expect something similar,"" he added.
""China always places a high priority on relations with bordering countries, and Vietnam is a fraternal socialist country making it even more of an important relationship,"" he told DW.
At the same time, Abuza notes that China has been ""clearly unhappy"" by Hanoi flirting with the US and its close allies. In September, US President Joe Biden visited Vietnam, with him and Trong signing a ""Comprehensive Strategic Partnership for Peace, Cooperation and Sustainable Development"" between the two countries.

With this move, Vietnam added the US to a short list of strategic partners which also includes China, India, Russia and South Korea, and most recently, Japan. Hanoi and Tokyo decided to elevate their diplomatic relations to the level of a comprehensive strategic partnership after Vietnamese President Vo Van Thuong visited Japan at the end of November.
Bill Hayton, an associate fellow with the Asia-Pacific Program at Chatham House, a think tank in London, said Vietnam has upgraded ties with others to maintain its own independence.
""China is a massive country that's right on their border, but they don't want to be sucked into China's orbit."" Hayton stressed.
While Vietnam is ""very much attached to Asia and its relations with China,"" it uses the US, Japan, India, and other partners to preserve its autonomy, according to the expert.
Compared to Washington, Beijing has had a massive head start in building its partnership with Vietnam — China and Vietnam signed their strategic partnership deal in 2008.
China is Vietnam's largest trading partner. Bilateral commerce surpassed $200 billion (€186 billion) in 2021, according to reports. In comparison, the US-Vietnam trade reached around $111.5 billion in the same year.
Economy will play a key role in the high-level meetings between Xi and various Vietnamese leaders this week, according to Nguyen Khac Giang, a researcher and visiting fellow at ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute.
""While geopolitical implications will take the headline, the visit also symbolizes the strengthening ties between Vietnam and China,"" he said.

Xi's trip will be his third official visit to Vietnam since he became president in March 2013. According to Nguyen Khac Giang, Xi has made few international trips after the COVID pandemic, and his choice to visit Hanoi ""highlights Vietnam's significance in China's grand strategy.""
""While Vietnam may remain cautious about joining China-led political initiatives, I think we can expect both sides to improve economic cooperation, particularly in infrastructure development and green energy transitions, where Vietnam desperately needs more investments,"" he said.
Vietnam has become a renewable energy leader in Southeast Asia, despite its massive coal reserves.
Moving away from trade, Vietnam and China have not been able to defuse tensions over disputed territory in the South China Sea. The two nations claim sovereignty over the Spratly and Paracel Islands, part of a larger territorial dispute affecting several nations in the region.
""The South China Sea is an irritant for the leadership in Hanoi. It puts them in a very awkward position,"" said US professor Abuza.
""They can't afford to stand up and confront China, but failing to do so opens them up to criticism by their own population. They can't appear to be capitulating to Beijing,"" he added.

But even with this conflict, major rifts between the two remain unlikely, said Hayton.
""For the Vietnamese Communist Party, the Chinese Communist Party is their best friend in the world. And the things that the Communist parties worry about, mainly like losing power, they share and so they work together to preserve their regimes. And I think that's far more important than anything to do with South China Sea or the other issues that divide them,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-chancellor-olaf-scholz-gets-backing-from-his-spd/a-67689562,POLITICS,German Chancellor Olaf Scholz gets backing from his SPD 11.12.2023,"The mood was grim when 600 delegates from Germany's center-left Social Democrats (SPD) headed to Berlin for their national party conference last weekend. Although the SPD won over 26% in the previous general election in 2021 and has since led the federal government, new polls suggest that if national elections were held now, the party would receive just 14% of the vote.  
Four out of five eligible voters say they are dissatisfied specifically with the work of Chancellor Olaf Scholz. That is an all-time low for a German head of government. 
""The house is burning, and people are losing faith in us,"" Philipp Türmer, who leads Jusos, the SPD's youth wing, told delegates. 

Crisis after crisis has hit Germany since the SPD took over government two years ago, with the support of the Greens and business-first Free Democrats (FDP). The latest one: a decision by the Constitutional Court ruling the government's budget partially unconstitutional. In 2024, that leaves a shortfall of €17 billion ($18.3 billion), according to a government estimate. 
There is internal disagreement about how to plug that hole. The SPD and Greens want to declare a national emergency, allowing them to suspend constitutional debt rules and borrow more money. The FDP is against that. 
Finding a solution is a ""very difficult task,"" Scholz told party conference delegates. ""Especially when you can't just do it the way you think is right, but also need the agreement of others."" 
He insisted, however, that the governing coalition would find a solution, one that would not lead to the ""dismantling"" of the social welfare state that the FDP has been pushing for. 
The chancellor is not known as a compelling orator. He usually reads his speeches, his voice monotonous. Not for nothing is he nicknamed the ""Scholzomat"" on account of his robotic style of delivery. Pointing to his seemingly unshakable self-confidence, critics say he comes across as condescending, especially when he is defensive.
But at the weekend conference, Scholz's 51-minute address was met with standing ovations from the party delegates.
Given the budget woes, there are new calls to ""modernize"" the so-called debt brake, which strictly regulates how much the German state can borrow. Proponents of constitutional reform fear that the spending restrictions are limiting Germany's ability to make much-needed investments. 
""China, the US, South Korea, India — the world's largest economies are investing massively in climate-neutral technologies and digitalization,"" Lars Klingbeil, the party's co-chair, said. ""It's about jobs and innovation, prosperity and security. The future of this country is a state that invests, that protects, that provides security in these turbulent times."" 
Jusos tried to push through a conference vote to do away with the debt brake altogether. That failed, but they did manage to get an agreement on suspending it for 2024, with designs to reform it thereafter. 
One area of imperiled policy at the federal level is Germany's support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia's full-scale invasion. Scholz promised that the billions Germany pledged would be there but recognized that a prolonged war means doing ""what is necessary for a long time."" 
In the United States, too, money for Ukraine is running into the friction of domestic politics. Scholz said that the future of bipartisan support for Ukraine is hardly assured, which means Germany must be ""in a position"" to step up even more. 
Part of Scholz's address to delegates focused on the renewed rise of right-wing populism — in Germany and around Europe. He blamed socioeconomic upheaval that has left many uncertain about ""whether it would turn out well for them and their families."" 
In Germany, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is seeing record success in polls. In some states, they are the most favored party, even as domestic intelligence has designated parts of the AfD as far-right threats to German democracy. 
At the same time, the AfD's anti-migrant and xenophobic positioning has been amplified by other parties, including the SPD. Scholz has recently come out in favor of faster deportations of asylum seekers.  
Despite the ongoing political malaise with no clear solution, the party conference organizers felt they had achieved their goal of showing a sense of solidarity.  
""The SPD won the election with unity and confidence,"" said Saskia Esken, the party's other co-leader, referring to the 2021 vote. 
Her counterpart, Klingbeil, acknowledged that the ""task is huge. But I am firmly convinced that there is no other political force that can achieve all of this.""

https://www.dw.com/en/sleeper-train-relaunched-between-berlin-and-paris/a-67689539,TRAVEL,Sleeper train relaunched between Berlin and Paris 11.12.2023,"An overnight sleeper train from Berlin to Paris is available again. It is he first such service in almost a decade and was launched on December 11, 2023.
The journey takes 15 hours with tickets starting at around €30 ($32). It initially operates three times a week with the goal of running every night by October 2024.
The revived night train is result of a partnership between Germany's national railway operator Deutsche Bahn and French state railroad SNCF, with the trains themselves provided by Austrian railway ÖBB's Nightjet brand.
""The new night train connections are very well booked over the holidays,"" Deutsche Bahn said.
""Basically, as soon as we launch a new night train connection together with our partner railroads, there is a real boom in bookings.""
Deutsche Bahn discontinued its Berlin-Paris night train service in 2014 with an aging fleet and a decrease in demand.
Now interest in sleeper trains is booming once again in Europe as travelers grow more aware of the environmental costs associated with air travel.
However, night trains still remain unreliably profitable and the new service was made possible with €10 million ($11 million) per year in subsidies from the French government.
Meanwhile, Deutsche Bahn aims to expand its night train connections to 13 other large European cities in partnership with other operators.

https://www.dw.com/en/japan-unpacking-the-nuances-of-the-traditional-bow/a-67687741,CULTURE,Japan: Unpacking the nuances of the traditional bow 11.12.2023,"To the Japanese, the bow is something they do every day. Children bow to their teacher and say ""ohayou gozaimasu,"" or ""good morning,"" at the start of every school day. It would be unthinkable for a business meeting to commence without formal bows.
Shop staff and train conductors, hotel employees, janitors and deliverymen all bow to their customers. Even passing a colleague in a corridor will inevitably elicit eye contact and a deep nod.
It's a greeting, and it's polite. But a bow to a Japanese person imparts much more information, with each variety having a nuance that communicates a slightly different meaning.
""Bowing is a key part of greetings in Japan,"" said Kiyomoto Ogasawara, the heir to the 32nd headmastership of the Ogasawara-ryu school of ""reiho,"" or etiquette.
""Bowing signifies trust and peace by showing vulnerability, as we avert our eyes and expose the head,"" explained Ogasawara, whose family has served as instructors to generations of shoguns since the school was established more than 830 years ago.
Alongside ""reiho,"" Ogasawara-ryu masters teach the disciplines of archery and mounted archery, an important military skill as well as a religious ritual at Shinto shrines since ancient times.

And while etiquette and archery may not appear to be compatible skills, Ogasawara said incorporating proper etiquette into a person's daily life is required to attain the strong legs and perfect posture needed to have both hands free to fire a bow from a galloping horse.
And that's why, historically, warriors and the elite in society were taught that posture and etiquette are of such importance.
It's widely believed that bowing became the accepted greeting as far back as the Asuka period, between 593 A.D. and 710 A.D. Buddhism was arriving in Japan from mainland Asia and there were shifts in the nascent nation's artistic, social and political mores.
In the Buddhist faith, bowing was — and remains — an important gesture of respect and piety, and it was soon adopted to indicate similar reverence for the elite in Japan's strictly hierarchical society.
And while the samurai no longer rule Japan, the bow has endured as the mark of respect. And failing to perform an adequate bow can still be perceived as a slight, particularly among older, more traditional Japanese.
Today, the bow is the time-honored greeting in Japan, but it's also used to communicate farewell, the start or end of a class, meeting or ceremony and to express gratitude. The bow is also used as an apology, to accompany a request or show sympathy or appreciation. It is deployed when a person is worshipping or at the outset of formal ceremony, and is a critical element of martial arts.
There are three main types of bow in the Japanese business world, but each starts from the same position: straight back, legs straight and firmly planted to avoid slouching. The bow should then be performed in time with one's breathing.
Bending forward from the waist should take one inhalation of breath. That position is then sustained for the time it takes to exhale and then the person performing the bow inhales again as he or she returns to an upright position.
The ""eshaku"" bow is a relatively casual greeting, exchanged between people of the same status or when formalities are not as important, and only requires leaning forward to an angle of 15 degrees for a few seconds.
Japan's national sport can now be enjoyed along with a meal. The Yokozuna Tonkatsu Dosukoi Tanaka restaurant opened its doors in Tokyo in 2022, as a place for former sumo wrestlers to demonstrate the traditional art. The concept has been met with great enthusiasm from diners.







The ""keirei"" bow is the most common variant in the Japanese business world, and requires the person to lean at an angle of 30 degrees and look at the ground about 1 meter (about 3 feet) in front of their toes.
A ""keirei"" bow is used to greet clients, join a meeting or during interactions with superiors.
The ""saikeirei"" indicates the greatest respect to the recipient and requires a bow from the waist of as much as 70 degrees and sustained for several seconds to emphasize respect and sincerity. The ""saikeirei"" is deployed to greet a very important person, such as a member of the imperial family, to express deep regret or ask for a significant favor.
Men performing these bows are expected to keep their arms rigid alongside their legs, while women often place one hand atop the other in front of the abdomen.
Bows performed in the seated position are known as ""zarei"" and usually take place on traditional tatami mat floors during traditional occasions, such as the tea ceremony or martial arts tournaments.
All seated bows start from the ""seiza"" seated posture, with the legs tucked directly below and with the toes pointing straight behind. The person sits on their calves with the elbows pointed slightly out and with the palms of the hands on the top of the thighs.
This position can be uncomfortable for non-Japanese, especially if it has to be sustained for a long time, but Japanese will appreciate good posture.
The ""saikeirei"" bow starts at the ""seiza"" position and requires the person to lean forward until their chest is on their lap. Simultaneously, the hands slide forward along the thighs until they are on the tatami floor in front of the knees.
The final position will see the person's face around 5 centimeters (2 inches) from the floor, and the palms of the hands making a triangle on the floor.
The ""futsurei"" is a less formal variety of the same bow and only requires the person to dip their body until their head is around 30 centimeters from the floor. The ""senrei"" is even more relaxed and only requires the person to bow about 30 degrees from the waist and have the tips of their fingers on the tatami.
Another, far more rare bow, is the ""dogeza,"" which requires the person to get on their hands and knees and place their face on the ground — and was in the past used when a person was begging for their life after somehow offending a powerful superior.










Matthew Strecher, a professor of Japanese literature at Sophia University in Tokyo, was given lessons in etiquette when he first arrived in Japan in the 1980s. Emphasis was placed on a proper bow and ""not just ducking my head briefly,"" he said.
""Some latitude is given to foreign people when they try to bow and I think Japanese are even quite amused as they watch us try to get it right, but I do think they appreciate the effort,"" he said. ""In the same way, they do not appreciate it when we flout expectations and make no effort at what is quite a special moment.""
After more than three decades in Japan, Strecher said he knows when a less formal nod to a colleague in passing is adequate and occasions when a greater expression of gratitude or respect is required.
""If I am saying goodbye, then it is important to bow properly because failing to do that would not be appreciated, and in a business setting we are expected to do the right thing because it is about ensuring the harmony of the workplace,"" he added.
Kiyomoto Ogasawara said younger generations of Japanese do not grasp the exact meaning of Japan's most important form of unspoken communication.
""Actually, the subtle meanings of different bows are less known nowadays, even in Japan,"" he admitted. ""While they were traditionally learned in the home, I believe that anyone can grasp these nuances, with some studying,"" he told DW.
""Bowing reflects our cultural identity, so it is vital for understanding our roots and sharing them with others,"" he added.
""It is part of our culture, influenced by many factors, such as our history and environment. Recognizing and using different forms of bowing is very valuable.""

https://www.dw.com/en/dr-congos-election-campaign-and-its-unresolved-conflict/a-67659365,POLITICS,DR Congo's election campaign and its unresolved conflict 11.12.2023,"The hurdles to holding free and fair elections in the vast Democratic Republic of the Congo are high. This bureaucratic act would require a long lead time, even under ideal conditions.
But the conditions for the December 20 elections are far from ideal. A land mass of more than 2.3 million square kilometers (905,355 square miles) can only be covered by plane, and the roads are often in poor condition.
Everything takes longer, from registering voters to distributing election documents and ballot boxes. Yet, in an interview with DW, Congo's Independent National Electoral Commission, or CENI, is optimistic ahead of the presidential, parliamentary and municipal polls.
""If God wills it, everything will be peaceful,"" said Didi Manara Linga, CENI's deputy chair, in a recent interview. ""After all, all the presidential candidates are holding their campaigns. So far, we haven't seen any obstacle that would be so big that we couldn't hold the election.""

Currently, Congo's conflict-torn eastern provinces, especially North Kivu, have the full attention of politicians.
Several presidential candidates have hit the campaign trail in eastern Congo, holding rallies in towns like Goma, Beni and Butembo. It seems the flare in the conflict that has pitted M23 rebels against pro-government local militias and Congolese soldiers has become the sole campaign issue.
Presidential candidate Moise Katumbi, seen as a serious contender, has promised to bring peace to the east in six months.
Nobel Peace Prize winner Denis Mukwege, also running for the presidency, sees peace in the east as a top priority. ""Stop the war,"" wrote Mukwege on X, formerly Twitter, after his appearances in Beni and Goma. ""Lobi te, Lelo — not tomorrow, but today!""
The M23 rebel group, which the UN has said is supported by neighboring Rwanda, de facto controls the territories of Masisi and Rutshuru in North Kivu. As a result, voting won't take place there.
Incumbent President Felix Tshisekedi has justified this exclusion of the approximately 1 million eligible voters in the territories with the need to be able to hold the elections on schedule.
The candidates' focus on North Kivu, M23 and Rwanda is ""quite contradictory,"" political analyst Onesphore Sematumba of the International Crisis Group, a think tank, told DW.
""Two territories are excluded from the electoral process because of the insecurity and presence of the M23,"" said Sematumba. ""But it is precisely these territories that are absent from the vote that are most present in the debate.""
Everything else — campaign programs and policies — has been forgotten, he pointed out. Sematumba criticized the fact that although Tshisekedi has been in power for five years, analysis of his presidency is lacking.
During his five years in office, Tshisekedi has failed to end the raging conflict, which involves more than 120 rebel groups, despite numerous attempts to organize external support.
Two international peacekeeping forces are withdrawing from eastern Congo. The 15,000-strong UN stabilization mission in the central African country, known as MONUSCO, has long lost the trust of the local population. It signed a withdrawal agreement at the end of November.
The mandate of the seven-nation East African Community regional force, which deployed troops to the violence-plagued region late last year, expired on December 8 on Tshisekedi's request.
Tshisekedi's five years in office haven't left much in the way of notable achievements. Forced into an awkward power-sharing deal with outgoing President Joseph Kabila, who ruled Congo for 18 years, it took Tshisekedi two years to distance himself from the former leaser and his political camp.
But even in the second half of his term, Tshisekedi hasn't undertaken any significant reforms, probably due to the escalating crisis in the east and the approaching elections.
Tshisekedi's challenger, Katumbi, has already united several competitors behind him, including former Prime Minister Matata Ponyo.
Two other heavyweights remain: Martin Fayulu, who many believe was the real victor of the contested elections in 2018, and Mukwege. Whether these two could join forces to form a second opposition alliance remains to be seen.
In the 2018 elections, several prominent opposition leaders were banned from running. In contrast, the 2023 list is crowded.
""From the outset, Tshisekedi gambled on dispersing the opposition,"" said Sematumba. ""That's why CENI admitted all candidates. The more candidates, the better.""
The question of alliances is also crucial for political newcomer Tshisekedi, the son of seasoned politician and charismatic opposition figure Etienne Tshisekedi, who essentially began his political career when he assumed the presidency in early 2019.
""Tshisekedi doesn't know the country, and the country doesn't know him,"" said Sematumba. ""In his five years in power, I think he's only been to the east once, before the M23 resurgence [in October].""
According to Sematumba, Tshisekedi's party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, doesn't have roots in large parts of the country.
That's why the president has forged his own alliance with political heavyweights from different regions: former Vice President Jean-Pierre Bemba, who has a strong base in the north, Economy Minister Vital Kamerhe and others from North Kivu and his prime minister, Sama Lukonde, of Katanga province in the southeast.
The election will also have an element of surprise. It's a first-past-the-post ballot, which means there will be no run-off between the top two candidates. As a result, a slight lead could be enough to secure the presidency.

https://www.dw.com/en/eu-approves-germanys-payments-for-early-coal-exit/a-67688161,POLITICS,EU approves Germany's payments for early coal exit 11.12.2023,"The European Commission on Monday said Germany should be allowed to pay the energy giant RWE some €2.6 billion ($2.8 billion) in state aid for the closure of coal power stations.
Under German law, no more electricity is to be produced from coal from 2038 onward. However, the three-way ""traffic light"" coalition that makes up the German government had agreed to move the date forward to 2030.
EU law generally prohibits state aid unless reasons of general economic development justify it. In a statement, the Commission decided this was the case regarding Germany's payments.
It said that, in the case of a €2.6 billion payment to RWE, the compensation would allow the phasing out of lignite-powered energy plants in the Rhine region.
The Commission found that although the payment did constitute a form of state aid for the industry, this was necessary to achieve the goal of phasing out coal.
""The Commission concluded that the contribution to EU environmental and climate goals of the measure outweighs any potential distortion of competition brought about by the support.
On this basis, the Commission approved the German measure under EU State aid rules, adding that it was ""necessary, appropriate and proportionate.""

It found that the current net value of RWE's forgone profits was ""measurably higher than the current net value of the compensation.""
Commission officials wrote that the compensation would contribute to the decarbonization of the economy in line with the EU's objective of becoming carbon neutral by 2050.
However, its decision did not extend to a German government payment of €1.75 billion to the energy firm LEAG, which operates a plant in the eastern German region of Lausitz, between Cottbus and Dresden. That payment must still be decided upon.
The Commission was ""fully conscious of the need to address the challenges that lignite exit poses for the affected regions and workers in eastern Germany,"" it said.

https://www.dw.com/en/fossil-fuel-phaseout-is-it-actually-possible/a-67686894,NATURE AND ENVIRONMENT,Fossil fuel phaseout — is it actually possible? 11.12.2023,"What do kicking back and watching Netflix, hopping in the car to work, and sitting in a steel-framed skyscraper have in common? They are all powered in some way by fossil fuels. 
From the industrial processes that create steel and cement to the electricity powering homes; oil, coal and gas continue to meet more than 80% of the world's energy needs. 
Burning fossil fuels accounts for 75% of the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet, increasing average global temperatures and contributing to extreme weather events worldwide.
Scientists say that to keep to the Paris Agreement ambition of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), countries must slash emissions by 43% by 2030. That means rapidly reducing the use of fossil fuels and switching to renewables-based energy supplies. 
""It's completely feasible to have a fossil fuel phaseout, both at the global level and the country level,"" said Natalie Jones, energy policy adviser at the International Institute for Sustainable Development think tank.
Jones told DW that the IPCC, the UN's climate body, and the intergovernmental International Energy Agency (IEA) have laid out ""global-level road maps"" to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. 
The technology is there, according to scientists and numerous analysts. 
""We can get that phaseout starting with a phasedown in this decade and we know its practical and its possible because we are seeing it out in the world today,"" said Rachel Cleetus, policy director on the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a US-based nonprofit. 
""We are seeing renewable energy ramp up at record rates. We are seeing electric vehicles, energy storage costs come down year on year by double digits.""  
While fossil fuels still make up most of the global energy mix, renewable capacity is expanding faster than ever and prices are plummeting. Over the last decade solar energy has dropped almost 90% and onshore wind by 69%, meaning it now costs less than half that of the cheapest fossil-fuels.
Industries that are more difficult to decarbonise — such as steel, cement and long-haul aviation — need more innovation and research, Cleetus said, adding that they should not be used as an excuse for inaction. 

According to the IEA the path to net zero by 2050 is narrow but still achievable, so long as we take immediate action to deploy massive amounts of all the clean and efficient energy technologies available. The agency also maps a potential role for technologies such as carbon capture and storage — which has not yet been rolled out at scale — and green hydrogen further down the timeline.  
""We have essentially the technological readiness to achieve it — or we expect to have over the next 25 years — but the political commitment and investments are not there yet,"" said Aurelien Saussay, assistant professor of environmental economics in the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics.
A 2023 analysis of 63 of the world's biggest economies, collectively responsible for 90% of global emissions, found none to be doing enough to avert the worst impacts of climate change. 
This political inaction looms over COP28. A recent UN stocktake of national climate plans also found that countries are ""significantly off track"" in meeting their commitments to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
While an estimated $1.8 trillion was invested in clean energy in 2023, this needs to be ramped up to over $4.5 trillion to stay in line with net-zero pathways, according to the IEA.
Researchers and campaigners also say that besides increasing available funds, money has to be distributed more fairly. 
Kelly Trout, research co-director at the US-based advocacy organization Oil Change International said a systemic change of global financial architecture is needed to increase access to funds for clean energy in poorer countries.
""Countries in the global south need to be able to leapfrog fossil fuels and build models of development that are both sustainable for the climate and better for people and communities."" 
Key to achieving a fossil fuel phaseout is ensuring it is a just transition, according to Steve Pye associate professor in energy systems, at University College London. 
""What does an equitable phaseout look like? Well, it's about rich countries who are less dependent, [on fossil fuels] and have large economies to take a leadership role.""
""But still, the political economy of this is very, very difficult,"" he continued, adding that it is hard to see the way forward for how quickly some heavily fossil fuel-dependent countries — such as Iraq, where oil funds over 80% of the government budget — would need to phaseout to meet the 1.5 degree target.
In wealthy countries, that need to move ""first and fastest"" towards the phaseout, the primary roadblock to rapid progress is ""the political will to stand up to the fossil fuel industry,"" said Trout. 
She added that if leaders do commit to a phaseout in the final COP28 text, this would mean governments had to return home and immediately put bans on new fossil fuel licensing and permits for new fossil fuel infrastructure.
""From a technological point of view, there's a lot of hope out there,"" said Pye, highlighting how there are increasing signs that energy systems can be decarbonised and electrified in an economically efficient way.
""It's just about getting those investments in the right place and scaling them…So that definitely does give me some optimism that we have a way out. Whether we take it or not is another thing.""

https://www.dw.com/en/india-top-court-upholds-removal-of-kashmir-special-status/a-67685938,CONFLICTS,India: Top court upholds removal of Kashmir special status 11.12.2023,"India's Supreme Court has upheld a 2019 move by the government to revoke a special semi-autonomous status granted to former state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The court said that the special status given to the territory under Article 370 of the Indian consitution was a ""temporary provision.""
It also said that Jammu and Kashmir should be put on par with other Indian states ""at the earliest and as soon as possible,"" with local elections to take place by September 30, 2024.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday hailed the verdict on social media, calling it ""a beacon of hope, a promise of a brighter future and a testament to our collective resolve to build a stronger, more united India.""
The Muslim-majority region of Kashmir is disputed by India and Pakistan has long been a source of tension in Indian politics. A number of separatist groups are active in the Indian-controlled territory.
Article 370 of the Indian constitution allowed Jammu and Kashmir to have its own constitution and a degree of internal autonomy. Under locally approved laws, this meant that only local Kashmiris could vote, own land and apply for government jobs.
However, the government revoked this status in 2019 and divided the state into two union territories — Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Union Territory of Ladakh — that have been governed directly from New Delhi.

""The overall feeling among common people is that they would be subjected to more policies thrust forward by New Delhi without any interference,"" said journalist Murali Krishnan reporting for DW in New Delhi.
""Many are not convinced by the government’s assurance following the court verdict that it would pave the way for a promise of a brighter future.""
""For them, Article 370 and Article 35A of the constitution represented the sentiments of the people, and with that gone, it meant a huge loss.""
More than 20 petitions had challenged the controversial abrogation of Article 370 in 2019 by Modi's Hindu-nationalist government. 
The petitioners had contested whether the Indian parliament had the power to revoke the region’s special status, maintaining that only the constituent assembly of Jammu and Kashmir could decide on it.

Journalist Samaan Lateef, reporting for DW in Srinagar, said on Monday that there is ""complete silence on the ground"" because the Supreme Court's decision was expected by both sides.

""A senior political leader summarized the court verdict as a minor aftershock of the real earthquake that happened on August 5, 2019 when the BJP government in New Delhi unilaterally abrogated the Article 370,"" he said.
""Over the past week, authorities have warned against social media dissent, intensifying security measures with checkpoints established throughout Kashmir to prevent any untoward incidents.""
Indian authorities have previously responded to protests against the change with mass arrests, lockdowns and a months-long communication blackout.

https://www.dw.com/en/west-africa-leaders-set-terms-for-lifting-niger-sanctions/a-67684663,CONFLICTS,West Africa leaders set terms for lifting Niger sanctions 10.12.2023,"West African leaders on Sunday demanded a ""short"" period of transition toward civilian rule in coup-hit Niger before they would ease economic sanctions on the country.
At a summit in Nigeria's capital Abuja, the leaders of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) officially recognized the junta in power.
They said a heads-of-state group from Benin, Togo and Sierra Leone would engage with Niger's regime's CNSP (National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland) leadership to decide on conditions for lifting sanctions.
""Based on the outcomes of the engagement by the committee of heads of state with the CNSP, the authority will progressively ease the sanctions imposed on Niger,"" ECOWAS Commission President Omar Touray told the closing of the summit.
""Failure by the CNSP to comply with the outcomes of engagement with the committee, ECOWAS shall maintain all sanctions,"" he added.
Niger's junta had previously said it would take three years to return to civilian rule.
The recognition of the junta appears to diminish the chances that Niger's President Mohamed Bazoum may be reinstated.
He was deposed on July 26, prompting ECOWAS to impose tough sanctions and suspend trade.
Niger's military leaders had previously rejected a call by Nigeria to free Bazoum, who is under house arrest, and allow him to fly to a third country, as a step to opening talks on lifting sanctions.
ECOWAS leaders, again, requested Bazoum's immediate and unconditional release — but this time were silent on his future as head of state.
The West African regional bloc also left on the table a possible military intervention in Niger, though analysts say that appears increasingly unlikely.
West and Central Africa have seen a surge of coups over the past three years, with eight military takeovers, including Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea.
In the past month, the governments of Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau have also described political crises as attempted coups.
Despite sanctions and other measures by ECOWAS, Touray told the heads of state that Niger's junta has consolidated its grip on power.
The country's military has demanded that French troops based there to fight Islamist militants in the Sahel region leave.
Niger's junta has also allied with Burkina Fasoand Mali and turned to Russia for a military partnership after severing ties with the West.
The military governments of Mali and Burkina Faso have, meanwhile, stopped collaborating with ECOWAS on a potential and delayed return to civilian rule. In Mali's case, civilian rule was last in place before the first of two coups, in August 2020. Burkina Faso's elected government was ousted last year.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-thousands-rally-in-berlin-against-antisemitism/a-67684159,POLITICS,Germany: Thousands rally in Berlin against antisemitism 10.12.2023,"Several thousand people protested Sunday in the German capital, Berlin, against antisemitism, hatred and racism.
The march came amid a rise in antisemitic incidents since the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel and the launch of Israel's offensive in Gaza.
A similar protest was held in the Belgian capital, Brussels, in support of the country's Jewish community.

In Berlin, demonstrators braved heavy rain as they moved from the Tiergarten to the Brandenburg Gate under the motto ""Never again is now,"" a reference to the Holocaust and the crimes committed by the Nazi government.
Police estimated the number of participants at 3,200, while organizers said they expected 10,000 people to take part.
Josef Schuster, the president of the Central Council of Jews, said at the event that he sometimes didn't recognize Germany as ""something has gotten out of hand,"" referring to a rise in antisemitic incidents in recent years, particularly since the start of the most recent  Israel-Hamas conflict.
""There is still an opportunity to repair this situation, but to do so you also have to admit what has gone wrong in the last few years, what you were unable or unwilling to see,"" he added.
The protest was also attended by Labor Minister Hubertus Heil and Bundestag President Bärbel Bas.
Germany banned several pro-Palestinian demonstrations in recent weeks after some protesters chanted antisemitic slogans during earlier rallies.
The country has also registered hundreds of criminal offenses against Jewish people and Jewish institutions, including synagogues and schools.
A pro-Palestinian demonstration was, however, held in downtown Berlin on Sunday, drawing up to 2,500 people at its peak, according to police. 
Marchers at the Brussels rally waved Belgian flags and held up signs reading, ""You don't have to be Jewish to march against antisemitism,"" ""antisemitism kills"" and other slogans.
Joel Rubinfeld, president of the Belgian League Against Antisemitism, said Belgium has witnessed ""a huge increase"" in anti-Jewish hatred over the past two months.
""We are living in a very complicated period,"" he said, adding that the rally sends ""a message to the Jewish community of Belgium to tell them that they are not alone.""
Sunday's protests were the latest in a series of rallies in European capitals showing support for Jewish communities, including those in London and Paris.

https://www.dw.com/en/chemnitz-riot-case-court-hears-far-right-violence-charges/a-67678485,POLITICS,Chemnitz riot case: Court hears far-right violence charges 10.12.2023,"The victims have been waiting a long time for this moment: Five years after right-wing extremist riots in the eastern German city of Chemnitz, the trial against the alleged perpetrators will begin on December 11.
Seven defendants between the ages of 26 and 51 stand accused of causing grievous bodily harm and disturbing the peace in 11 separate cases during the incidents of September 1, 2018.
That evening, following an event organized by the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD), right-wing populist association Pro Chemnitz, and the anti-Islam Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the Occident (PEGIDA ), the defendants are alleged to have engaged in violent confrontations with participants of a counterdemonstration, according to the indictment by the Dresden public prosector's office.
The demonstrations came amid heightened tensions in Chemnitz, following the stabbing death just days before of a 35-year-old German-Cuban man after an argument on the fringes of a city festival.
The case and its consequences attracted international attention, and one of the suspects, Syrian Alaa S., was sentenced to nine and a half years in prison for manslaughter and grievous bodily harm nearly one year later.
The city was in a state of emergency for days after the killing, which had sparked large demonstrations against immigration and refugee policy.
Victim counseling centers have called what happened a ""neo-Nazi manhunt."" When counterdemonstrations were organized in response to the xenophobic protests under the slogan ""Herz statt Hetze,"" or ""Heart Not Hate,"" the clashes ensued.
The Chemnitz district court will likely be packed on Monday, with 20 seats reserved for press alone. Due to the large number of defendants (29) there will be three trials. So far, 43 witnesses have been summoned, with 11 trial days scheduled at the Chemnitz district court until the end of January.
Petra Kürschner, the presiding judge at the Chemnitz District Court, told DW that the trial would not address politics.
""A political reappraisal must not be carried out by the court,"" she said. ""During the proceedings we must determine whether the defendants are guilty of a criminal offense and, if they are found guilty, how each of these people should be punished based on their individual guilt.""
By contrast, the political climate in the city continues to be shaped by the events of 2018.
""Right-wing protest has become the norm in Saxony,” according to an anti-far right series of publications by pro-democracy NGO Kulturbüro Sachsen. ""The riots in Chemnitz in 2018 saw the extreme right openly join forces, from the parliamentary wing of the AfD and new right-wing organizations, to right-wing hooligans and Nazi groups.""
Right-wing extremism researcher Beate Küpper, who teaches at the Niederrhein University of Applied Sciences, confirms the development of this trend. Right-wing extremism has entered relatively broad sections of the population, with acts of violence justified as resistance, she said in a recent TV interview.
Statistics in the state of Saxony reflect this. ""Politically motivated crime on the right continues to be a focus, accounting for around 30 percent of all politically motivated crimes,"" according to state law enforcement's 2022 crime numbers, which showed a year-on-year increase of one-third.
The shift to the right has also taken hold politically. In the 2019 local elections, the AfD garnered 17.9% of the vote in Chemnitz, more than tripling its share compared to 2014 (5.6%). The right-wing populist voter association Pro Chemnitz went from 5.7% to 7.7%. The center-left Social Democrats (SPD), socialist Left Party and conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) all sustained significant losses.
The campaign is already in full swing for the local elections on June 9, 2024. Just one day before voters head to the polls, the ""Kosmos Chemnitz” festival for democracy, society, music and culture is expected to draw some 50,000 visitors. It was launched in response to the right-wing extremist violence of September 1, 2018 with the intention of heralding Chemnitz's role as European Capital of Culture 2025.

https://www.dw.com/en/frances-new-immigration-bill-sparks-widespread-protests/a-67673671,POLITICS,France's new immigration bill sparks widespread protests 10.12.2023,"Thousands of people marched in the streets near Montparnasse train station in southern Paris on a recent Sunday afternoon. They were holding signs proclaiming their opposition to the ""Darmanin law,"" named after France's interior minister, Gerald Darmanin. Other placards said ""Immigration is not a problem ― racism is.""
Right at the front of the group, a megaphone in hand, was Ahmada Siby.
The 33-year-old Malian arrived in France almost five years ago. Benefiting from a legal loophole, he has been using other people's papers to work as a cleaner, a chambermaid and, lately, a dishwasher.
""Most of us undocumented immigrants are using this method, but it means we are paying social insurance fees and taxes without benefiting from services such as regular public health care like French citizens,"" he told DW.
""President Emmanuel Macron's government treats us as if we were nothing, although we're doing all the dirty work ― at construction sites, including the ones for the Paris Olympics next summer, in restaurants and as cleaners,"" he added.
That's why Siby and others have banded together to protest the bill, which France's government said is a compromise including left-wing and right-wing measures.
The draft law is set to be discussed in the National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament, starting on December 11, and could enter into force early next year.
The final version of the immigration bill still needs to be pinned down, but some details are already known.
The new bill is likely to fast-track asylum procedures and shorten delays for appeals, make family reunification more complicated and restrict the possibility to come to France for medical treatment. Changes also include the option of deporting people who were younger than 13 when they came to France, and deporting foreign parents whose children have French citizenship.
Paris was planning to create a one-year green card for people working in sectors with a labor shortage. But as it stands now, the decisions on these one-year permits have been left up to local authorities.
Interior Minister Darmanin brought the immigration reform bill into the Senate, but France's upper house of parliament, which has a center-right majority, recently toughened the draft considerably. And the government is expected to keep some of these changes to get the bill through the National Assembly. Macron's Renaissance party and its allies don't have an absolute majority there, and need the support of the conservative Republicans.
Since a recent terror attack by a Russian immigrant on French teacher Dominique Bernard in the northern town of Arras, the government has presented the law mostly as a safeguard against unwanted immigration and terrorism. Migrants, refugees and aid organizations are worried the new rules could lead to more stigmatization and discrimination.
Lise Faron from Paris-based Cimade, an NGO providing support for refugees and migrants, is among those who are deeply concerned by the new bill.
""The government had promised a balanced bill, and yet, the new rules will almost exclusively restrict immigrants' rights and make it more complicated for them to get legalized, which will result in even more undocumented migrants,"" she told DW.
""France has voted through many immigration bills, but it feels like we are passing a new threshold of toughness with this one ― for example by making it easier to expel foreign parents of French children, which was beforehand only possible if they had committed serious crimes,"" she added.

For Vincent Tiberj, a political sociology professor at University Sciences Po Bordeaux, the draft law reflects a general shift to the right in the political debate.
""Most French politicians are depicting immigrants as a burden and a threat. They completely forget that many migrants, also of later generations, are contributing a whole lot to our society,"" he told DW.
Tiberj thinks mainstream politicians are out to grab right-wing votes. Far-right party Rassemblement National is predicted to come first in next June's European Parliament elections, according to recent polls.
""And yet, parties such as Renaissance should know this strategy doesn't work ― it only legitimizes far-right movements and helps them gain even more ground,"" he said.
Alexis Izard, Renaissance parliamentarian for the department of Essonne just south of Paris, said the final bill will still be balanced.
""Every year, we need to expel about 4,000 illegal immigrants who have committed crimes, and that will be possible with this new law,"" he told DW, adding that deportation procedures would take one instead of two years after the changes.
""At the same time, we want to attract those who come here and work. This will be a highly efficient law,"" Izard said.
Herve Le Bras, historian and demographer at the Paris-based School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences EHESS, begs to differ on that last point.
He said none of the more than 100 other immigration laws since 1945 have been effective.
""The bill is completely useless and will have practically no impact on the number of migrants coming in per year. It only gives politicians, from the far-right to the far-left, a platform to express their stance,"" he said in a DW interview.
""If you look at the immigration figures under past governments, you'll see that they are uncorrelated to politics,"" he said.
Alain Fontaine, owner of the restaurant Le Mesturet in central Paris and head of French Association of Master Restaurateurs, is still hoping the initially planned one-year green card will be put back in and even extended.
""Bars and restaurants won't be able to function without foreign workers who represent about a quarter of our workforce,"" he told DW.
Some 12 out of his own 27 employees are foreigners.
""We need immigrants ― also since our own youth prefer to work in the digital sector or jobs linked to the protection of the environment,"" he said. ""They no longer want to do the tough jobs.""
Malian immigrant Ahmada Siby doesn't think the automatic one-year green card, even if prolonged, would be the right way forward.
""It would enshrine modern slavery into law, as we would need to work in that one sector to keep it. You'd still be at the boss's mercy,"" he said, sitting on his bed in a 15-square-meter (161-square-foot) room in the suburb of Montreuil east of Paris, a studio flat he's sharing with an uncle and a cousin.
""We want the government to legalize all of us, so that we can choose the job we'd like to do,"" he added.
Then, Siby looked at pictures of himself five years ago, after he had reached Spain from Morocco on a small inflatable boat.
He thinks of the crossing, which took almost a whole day, as ""the most difficult moment in my life."" Everyone on board almost died.
""Once you've survived this, you don't just give up,"" Siby said. ""I'm determined to fight for a better future.""

The Iranian judiciary's Mizan Online news portal said Johan Floderus was accused of ""extensive measures against the security of the country"" and spying for Israel. He was also charged with ""corruption on earth,"" one of Iran's most serious crimes which is punishable by death. 
Floderus, who is 33 years old, was arrested in April 2022 at Tehran International Airport while on vacation in Iran. He is reportedly being held in Evin Prison in Tehran, the country's most prominent incarceration facility for political prisoners and dissidents.   
The prosecution has claimed that Floderus gathered intel on Iran's nuclear programs and worked on ""subversive projects"" to help Israel.
Prosecutors also believe Floderus was setting up a network of Swedish intelligence agents in Iran and that he was in contact with the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK). The exiled MEK group seeks the overthrow of the Iranian government, with the Islamic Republic deeming it a terrorist organization.      
A verdict in the case is expected on December 19. 

Floderus' family has said he was arrested ""without any justifiable cause or due process."" 
""Today is International Human Rights Day, and on this day, we demand the release of Johan. Today makes 602 days since he has been illegally detained,"" an advocacy group called Free Johan Floderus posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. The group is made up of Floderus' family and friends.
Swedish and EU authorities have also chastised Iran for its detention and trial of Floderus. 
""There is no basis whatsoever for keeping Johan Floderus in detention, let alone bringing him to trial,"" Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom said, while adding that Swedish officials ""are working very intensively to secure Johan Foderus' release.""  

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has also said that there are ""no grounds"" for Floderus being kept in detention. 
Diplomatic relations between Sweden and Iran plummeted in 2019, when Sweden detained former Iranian official Hamid Nouri.
In 2022, Nouri was sentenced to life in prison by a Stockholm court for his role in the mass execution of political dissidents in Iran in 1988. The Iranian government has demanded Nouri's release.

https://www.dw.com/en/what-does-mohammadis-nobel-peace-prize-mean-for-iranian-women/a-67019869,HUMAN RIGHTS,What does Mohammadi's Nobel Peace Prize mean for Iranian women? 10.12.2023,"Narges Mohammadi , who has campaigned for human rights in Iran for decades, has been in and out of jail for nearly 20 years due to her tireless advocacy in defiance of the Islamic Republic's regime.
She has been arrested 13 times, convicted five times, and sentenced to a total of 31 years in jail. She is currently incarcerated in the Iranian capital Tehran's Evin prison, which is notorious for human rights abuses and the maltreatment of political prisoners in particular.
On Sunday, the children of Narges Mohammadi accepted the Nobel Peace Prize at Oslo's city  hall on her behalf in her absence. 
Mohammadi's husband, Taghi Rahmani, an exiled Iranian journalist who lives in France with the couple's children, told DW that the award was ""a tribute to resistance.""
""The fact that the ceremony began with the slogan of 'Women, Life, Freedom' shows that this award is meant for all those who are striving for civil liberties and democracy in Iran, and Narges is one of these individuals,"" he said.
In October, the Iranian lawyer and rights activist Shirin Ebadi told DW that Mohammadi's peace prize would "" draw international attention to human rights violations in Iran, particularly the discriminatory treatment of women.""
In 2003, Ebadi became the first Iranian person, as well as the first woman from the Islamic world, to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. 
""It will undoubtedly assist women in achieving equality and help Iranian society move towards democracy,"" Ebadi said, while congratulating ""all Iranian women"" and Mohammadi. ""She deserves this award. She had to sit in prison for many years because of her human rights activities.""
""It is an honor that two people from a human rights NGO in Iran have won the Nobel Peace Prize,"" she added, recalling Mohammadi's time at the Defenders of Human Rights Center, an Iranian human rights NGO Ebadi co-founded in 2001.
Mansoureh Shojaei, an Iranian women's rights activist based in The Hague, told DW Mohammadi's prize was a sign that last year's ""Women, Life, Freedom"" protests had once again drawn global attention to a movement that has been fighting in Iran for decades.
""When the Nobel Prize is awarded to Iranian women after a 20-year gap, it indicates that Iran is truly a land of remarkable women,"" she added.
""Whether they are Nobel laureates, women in prison, women in comas in hospitals, or women whose loved ones rest in cemeteries, and even those women who were banned from education and flogged in the streets — all of these demonstrate that the Nobel Prize awarded 20 years ago laid the foundation for various social and women's movements,"" Shojaie said.
Mohammadi ""is the daughter of those gatherings, the offspring of those coalitions, even though she was active herself back then and constantly ever since.""
Women in Iran can face severe consequences, including death, simply for showing their hair in public. Going outside without a headscarf is forbidden by a strict ""morality"" code that is enforced by roving squads of police in major cities.
Last year, the death of a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, Jina Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran's ""morality police,"" who had detained her for wearing her headscarf ""improperly"" sparked unprecedented protests in cities across Iran. They were mainly led by young women, who risked their lives to defy the regime. People in cities around the world staged demonstrations in solidarity.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee said the 2023 prize also recognized the thousands of Iranians who ""demonstrated against Iran's theocratic regime's policies of discrimination and oppression targeting women.""
Many demonstrators paid a heavy price when hundreds of people were killed in violent police crackdowns across Iran. 
The families of the victims are under continual pressure from authorities to not show any sign of dissent. Some are even banned from gathering at the grave sites of their murdered relatives.
Last month, Mohammadi and her fellow inmates staged a symbolic protest in the prison yard by burning their headscarves on the anniversary of Amini's death.
This week, the world received another reminder of the brutality faced by Iranian women. Activists say a 16-year-old girl was beaten into a coma by the so-called ""morality police"" in Tehran's subway because she was not wearing a hijab.
""Since the founding of the Islamic Republic in Iran in 1979, women in Iran have been systematically oppressed. Those who don't conform are punished. Women who resist, like me and other human rights activists, defy this system. Those in power try everything they can to break us and silence us,"" Mohammadi told DW in a June 2021 interview conducted before she began her latest prison sentence.
At the time, she had been charged with ""propaganda against the political system"" after trying to report the Evin prison director for severely beating her. She said Iran's authorities targeted her ""mainly because I am a woman who does not give in.""
Mohammadi's husband, who has not seen his wife in years, said that it was significant that the Nobel Peace Prize had been awarded to someone who was still in prison with other political activists.
He expressed hope that ""civil institutions in foreign countries will exert pressure on their governments to consider human rights as one of the most important aspects in their relations""  with Iran.
""Governments should understand that freedom in a globalized world is an issue of international importance,"" he added. 
Mansoureh Shojaei said that the Nobel could help women's rights movements, adding that it was the ""responsibility"" of activists to ""utilize these resources to the fullest extent.""
The Hague-based activist said Iranian women's rights movement had benefited from Ebadi's Nobel Prize 20 years ago, citing campaigns such as the ""one million signature campaign"" in Iran, which called for a change to discriminatory laws.
""This second Nobel Prize can be considered a result of the women's freedom movement,"" she said.
For her part, Shirin Ebadi said that she hoped fellow Nobel laureate Mohammadi's 2023 prize would ""make the Iranian government aware of its anti-human rights behavior"" and force officials to respect people's rights and release Mohammadi and all political prisoners.
""I wish Iran freedom,"" she said.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-retailers-report-weak-christmas-season-sales/a-67682333,SOCIETY,German retailers report weak Christmas season sales 10.12.2023,"German retailers on Sunday said sales ahead of Christmas had been disappointing, with a ""noticeable"" lack of momentum in the first weeks of Advent.
Although sales figures are up on the previous year, the volume of sales showed a marked dip in real terms because of rising inflation.
From more than 350 retail companies that were surveyed, some 60% expressed dissatisfaction with the latest trend in sales, the German Retail Association (HDE) said.
""The second week of Advent was noticeably weaker in the retail sector than the first week of Advent. Many retailers are now pinning their hopes on the final spurt before the festive season,"" HDE managing director Stefan Genth said.
Footfall in city centers is also down, with two-thirds of city retailers reporting fewer customers than the previous year.
The HDE forecast total sales of just over €120 billion ($129 billion) for this year's Christmas business in November and December.
This corresponds to an increase in sales of 1.5% — effectively down on the previous year in terms of sales volume.
The streets and squares of Vienna have been lit up with sparkling lights, making the Austrian capital particularly festive around the holidays. Here, you can see the Christmas lights along the Vienna Graben, a lively shopping street.










""Overall, only 15% of the retailers surveyed are satisfied with how the Christmas business has gone so far,"" the HDE report said.
Retailers were said to be looking forward to the coming weeks with ""muted expectations,"" the survey said. Just under a fifth of retailers who were surveyed expect a positive development.
However, the HDE's Genth was less pessimistic, pointing out that, in the second half of December, the ever-approaching holidays usually provide additional sales impetus.
""If the festive mood increases in the near future, it can noticeably boost Christmas business,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/hong-kong-polls-open-in-patriots-only-council-elections/a-67681215,POLITICS,Hong Kong: Polls open in 'patriots only' council elections 10.12.2023,"Voting for Hong Kong's district council elections got underway on Sunday, with the pro-China city government dismissing concerns of a potentially low turnout as many pro-democracy voters turning their backs on the polls. 
Sunday's candidates were required to seek nominations from three government-appointed committees, which effectively shut out all pro-democracy parties.  
""It is the last piece of the puzzle for us to implement the principles of patriots governing Hong Kong,"" Hong Kong's pro-Beijing Chief Executive John Lee said while casting his ballot, referring to China's ongoing efforts to weed out political opposition. 
As part of a widespread clampdown in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory under a so-called national security law, city authorities overhauled the councils' composition earlier this year. 
According to the new rules, seats up for direct election were drastically cut from 462 to 88. The other 382 seats are now controlled by the city leader, government loyalists and rural landlords.
A pro-democracy group called the ""League of Social Democrats"" said three of its members were detained Sunday in the Central business district. The group had planned to protest the elections. 
""Hong Kong people's right to vote and to be elected seems to be absent,"" the group said in a statement reported by Reuters news agency.
A police statement said three people were arrested on suspicion of ""attempting to incite others to carry out acts that disrupt"" the district council elections.
The last district council elections were held at the height of the 2019 anti-government protests, attracting a record 71% turnout and a landslide victory for the democratic camp.
The councilors for Hong Kong's 18 districts handle mostly local-level tasks like sanitation, transport routes, and the maintenance of public facilities. However, since Beijing's crackdown, the council elections have been seen as a bellwether for public sentiment of Hong Kong's overall leadership.
Chief Executive Lee said Sunday the 2019 had been used to ""sabotage governance"" and endanger national security.
After Hong Kong was handed back to China by the United Kingdom in 1997, Beijing vowed Hong Kong the territory could retain its Western-style liberties for the next half-a-century under the ""one country, two systems"" framework.
However, massive protests in 2019 toward Beijing's increased tinkering with Hong Kong's legal system led to weeks of massive protests, and a large scale crackdown by Beijing.
Since then, leading figures of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement have been arrested or exiled, along with an overall crackdown on civil liberties and the free press.

https://www.dw.com/en/at-75-un-human-rights-declaration-presents-challenge-to-germany/a-67659689,HUMAN RIGHTS,"At 75, UN human rights declaration presents challenge to Germany 10.12.2023","When German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock went to China earlier this year, she admonished her Chinese counterpart for his country's treatment of the Uyghur Muslim minority.
Qin Gang did not take the comment kindly, replying that China did not need ""a teacher from the West."" He rejected the notion that there are ""universal standards"" to protect human rights. Baerbock pointed to the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).
The UN General Assembly adopted the document on December 10, 1948.
Now, Baerbock has warned of the threat posed to the principles enshrined in that document, which is why ""universal human rights are more important than ever,"" she told a gathering of her Green Party's lawmakers marking the anniversary. She opposed the position that ""human rights were for fair-weather politics that are only important when there are no other problems.""

The declaration, which came into force just three years after the devastation of the Second World War, sums up its intentions in its first article: ""All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.""
What may seem like an obvious statement was considered a significant breakthrough in global cooperation. For Baerbock, the document forms the basis of German foreign policy 75 years later. 
Despite the many challenges to it, from the Middle East to Ukraine to Sudan, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, saw reason to celebrate the anniversary.
""The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a miraculous text,"" Volker Türk, the commissioner, said in a statement. ""At a time when the world emerged from cataclysmic events, the Declaration set out universal rights and recognized the equal worth of every person.""
""Even as the 30 articles of the Declaration have sparked a transformation in all areas of our lives,"" Türk added, ""the embers of racism, misogyny, inequality and hatred continue to threaten our world.""
The UN estimates that there are now 110 million refugees in the world and 735 million people without enough food to each. Fifty million people are in slavery, according to the International Labor Organization (ILO).
In all, the situation paints a grim picture that ""would have dramatically blown up my worst-case scenario ten years ago,"" Heiner Bielefeldt, a professor of human rights at the University of Erlangen in the southern German state of Bavaria, told DW. 
""There have not only been setbacks but outright collapses, both thanks to the advance of autocratic regimes as well as the autocratic tendencies within established democracies,"" he said.

Despite the poor grade for human rights enforcement, Bielefeldt noted some progress, such as the arrest warrant issued for Russian President Vladimir Putin by the International Criminal Court. Russia, however, does not recognize the court, and Putin is unlikely to face justice there for his invasion of Ukraine.
Germany's human rights standing has also taken a hit. International monitors have downgraded the country's standing from ""open"" to ""hampered,"" due to the state's treatment of climate activists. 
On the international level, however, Germany sees itself as a champion of human rights. Bielefeldt pointed to using German courts, under the principle of universal jurisdiction, to try perpetrators of torture in Syria. It was the first of its kind.

In January last year, the court sentenced the main defendant to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity, 27 counts of murder, rape and deprivation of liberty.
At the Greens' gathering, Baerbock acknowledged the diplomatic challenge of balancing engagement with accountability when it comes to countries with poor records on human rights. Given the number of crises confronting the international community, Bielefeldt said getting that balance right will remain a significant challenge for policymakers.
""It's no longer just about human rights violations here and there, or breaches of international humanitarian law, but about the fact that an entire set of international rules, developed over decades, is in danger of being destroyed,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-far-right-group-rallies-against-refugee-housing-plan/a-67679723,MIGRATION,Germany: Far-right group rallies against refugee housing plan 09.12.2023,"More than a thousand supporters of right-wing extremist group Aufbruch Gera held a protest in the eastern German city of Gera on Saturday against plans to build housing for refugees, police said.
More than 70 vehicles with about 150 occupants also drove through the city in a procession.
Public broadcaster MDR said the rally was mobilized by a group that supports right-wing extremist and agitator Christian Klar.
The domestic intelligence agency for the eastern state of Thuringia classifies the group, known as Aufbruch Gera, which might loosely translate to ""awakening in Gera,"" as a ""suspected extremist case.""
The agency's chief Stephan Kramer has described them as an ""extremist core group that expresses itself in a particularly drastic manner.""
The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party organized the vehicle convoy, MDR reported. The party has previously distanced itself from Aufbruch Gera.
Around 60 people took part in a counter-demonstration calling for solidarity with migrants and refugees — demanding they be treated with dignity.

Gera plans to house refugees at the former Wismut Hospital. The building will be able to house 200 refugees, the state government of Thuringia said.
The new facility will help relieve the overcrowded reception center in Suhl, a city to the west of Gera.
The former Wismut hospital had previously been used as a shelter for asylum seekers between 2015 and 2017.
In the run-up to the demonstration, Gera's mayor Julian Vonarb said that the heated debate surrounding the refugee housing was a major worry.
More than 250,000 migrants have applied for asylum in Germany so far in 2023, an increase of 76% on the previous year.
Several states have said they have reached their resource limits in trying to offer refuge to the newcomers.

https://www.dw.com/en/iran-nobel-prize-winner-mohammadi-begins-new-hunger-strike/a-67678782,HUMAN RIGHTS,Iran: Nobel Prize winner Mohammadi begins new hunger strike 09.12.2023,"Imprisoned Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi was expected to begin a new hunger strike, her family said Saturday. 
Mohammadi, who is 51 years old, will be awarded the prize in Norway on Sunday, but she is unable to attend as she is currently locked up in an Iranian prison. 
""She is not here with us today, she is in prison and she will be on a hunger strike in solidarity with a religious minority but we feel her presence here,"" Hamidreza Mohammadi, her younger brother, said during a media briefing in Oslo.    
Her 51-year-old husband, Taghi Rahmani, said the strike was an act of solidarity with the Baha'i religious minority. Members of the Baha'i faith face persecution and discrimination under Iran's conservative Islamic government. 
A post on Mohammadi's Instagram account said the human rights activist has already started the three-day hunger strike 24 hours before the ceremony. Her Instagram is administered by her friends. 
""On the day of the Nobel Prize ceremony, I want to be the voice of Iranians protesting against injustice and oppression,"" Mohammadi said, according to the post.     
Mohammadi is one of Iran's most prominent human rights activists.
On Sunday, Mohammadi's 17-year-old twins Ali and Kiana will accept the Nobel Prize on their mother's behalf. During the award ceremony, they will recite a speech written by their mother which was smuggled outside of the Tehran prison where she is being kept.
The twins have not seen their mother in nine years. They have resided in France since 2015.
Kiana said Thursday that she is ""pessimistic"" that she may see her mother again, whereas Ali said he was ""very optimistic"" regarding a reunion. 
Mohammadi, who has been jailed in Tehran's Evin prison since 2021, has been involved in human rights work over the past two decades. She is the former vice president of the Defenders of Human Rights Center, and has advocated against Iran's forced headscarf policies.   
The Norwegian Nobel Committee said it awarded the Nobel Prize to Mohammadi ""for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.""

""Her brave struggle has come with tremendous personal costs,"" the Norwegian Nobel Committee statement added, noting that she had been arrested 13 times, convicted five times and sentenced to 31 years in prison in total and 154 lashes.   
The Iranian Foreign Ministry has condemned the award of the prize to Mohammadi ""as biased and politically motivated.""
The selection of Narges Mohammadi as the winner comes after mass human rights and feminist protests in Iran following the death of Jina Mahsa Amini. Iranian police had arrested Amini in 2022 for not wearing her headscarf appropriately, with her death in custody sparking the ""Women, Life, Freedom"" movement.

https://www.dw.com/en/could-egypts-presidential-elections-be-a-chance-for-change/a-67647785,POLITICS,Could Egypt's presidential elections be a chance for change? 09.12.2023,"The polls opened inEgypt on Sunday in a presidential election overshadowed by the war in neighboring Gaza and a serious domestic economic crisis.
Voting will continue through Tuesday, with official results to be announced December 18. 
The vote will most likely see the 69-year-old incumbent Abdel Fattah el-Sissi winning a third term, which would be a first for the country of 113 million people.
Up until 2019, the constitution only allowed two presidential terms and el-Sissi was elected with no opposition to speak of with around 97% of the votes in 2014 and 2018. He then pushed for constitutional amendments that legitimize Egyptian presidents to stay for a third term, and extended the terms from four to six years.  
Meanwhile, Egypt's National Elections Authority, NEA, said in a statement that the electoral process involving a total of four candidates had been fair and just. 
Last week the NEA also announced that Egyptians abroad had completed casting their votes.
However, in the run-up to the elections, observers and human rights organizations repeatedly accused el-Sissi of cracking down on promising opposition candidates. 
""Hisham Kassem is currently in prison on political charges and Ahmed Altantawy is facing charges while dozens of members of his campaign are being detained,"" Timothy E. Kaldas, deputy director of the Washington-based Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, told DW.
The expected reelection comes at a time when el-Sissi is unlikely to face much international criticism in light of the country's role in the current war in Gaza.
 
Since the beginning of the war between Israel and Hamas, classified as a terrorist group by the US, EU, Germany and others, global attention has shifted from Egypt's dire human rights record, its crackdown on the political opposition and the poor economic state to its role as reliable political partner in the region, mediator and access point for humanitarian goods for the Palestinian population.
This has not only boosted el-Sissi's international reputation, but is likely to have a positive impact on the country's finances. 
""The European Commission announced up to €9 billion ($9.7 billion) in investments in Egypt while other reports indicate that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is considering as much as doubling the size of Egypt's loan in response to the situation,"" Kaldas said, adding that ""this happens despite the fact that Egypt has largely failed to fulfill its reform commitments over the past year, preventing the IMF from completing a review and disbursing loan tranches."" 
The planned investments and loans are a welcome shot in the arm for a country that has been reeling from an economic crisis since 2022.
According to the Central Bank of Egypt, inflation was at 38% in October, while the Egyptian pound has lost half its value against the US dollar. Official estimates state that 30% of the population live in poverty. Foreign reserves, which are needed to pay back loans, are almost depleted. 
However, none of the experts DW spoke to, expect any major international backlash.
""In the past, the West has not been too critical of elections in Egypt either, and el-Sissi and the military have been regularly perceived in the West as the only actors who can prevent chaos in the country,"" Christian Achrainer, a researcher at Denmark's Roskilde University, who has extensively published on Egypt, told DW. 
Moreover, not only Gaza, but also Egypt's other neighboring countries — Sudan, Libya and Yemen— are at war, and the Red Sea is on the verge of becoming a battlefield for Iran's proxy militias against Israel.
""It would be a horror scenario for European decision-makers if Egypt, as the most populous North African and Arab country, would become unstable as well,"" Achrainer added. 
This view is echoed by Gamal Abdel Gawad, a professor of political science at the American University in Cairo and advisor to the Cairo-based think tank Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies whose political leanings are considered closely aligned with the government.
""Neither the region nor the world is prepared to deal with a turbulent situation in Egypt due to an economic fallout,"" Gawad said. 
In his view, the war in Gaza and the threat to displace Palestinians and bring the conflict to Egypt, ""is a risk to the Egyptian national security which has led to a state of unity and increased support for the president,"" he told DW. 
For Timothy Kaldas, this also means that ""the recent softening of the West's position vis-a-vis Sisi's economic malpractice and rights violations in the midst of the war on Gaza gives further reason to doubt the needed reforms are on the horizon.""
Ahmed Mefreh, executive director of the Swiss-based human rights watchdog Committee for Justice, thinks that one scenario of the expected reelection of el-Sissi will lead at best ""to a continuation of the current cosmetic policies when it comes to human rights."" 
While the regime has released between 1,000 and 1,500 political prisoners this year, as part of a National Dialogue and political opening, Egyptian rights groups claim that at least three times as many political prisoners were arrested in the same period.
""Many of whom continue to be detained without trial or even charges,"" the Tahrir Institute's Kaldas said.
Egypt's most prominent political prisoner, Alaa Abdel-Fattah, also remains in prison. 
""The second scenario is a return to direct repression, including targeting human rights defenders and human rights organizations inside Egypt and in exile,"" Mefreh told DW. 
""The key difference will be whether the regime is under significant pressure to improve the human rights record during the current economic crisis, or not,"" he said, adding that ""the recent conflict between Israel and Gaza has shown that there is not enough serious pressure on the Egyptian regime, and this makes the second scenario more likely in the upcoming period.""

https://www.dw.com/en/cop28-opec-opposition-to-fossil-fuel-deal-met-with-outrage/a-67676599,NATURE AND ENVIRONMENT,COP28: OPEC opposition to fossil fuel deal met with outrage 09.12.2023,"Leaders from Germany, Spain and France reacted angrily on Saturday after the oil cartel OPEC called on its members to oppose any fossil fuels deal at COP28 — the United Nations Climate Change Conference taking place in Dubai.
OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais sent a letter to the group's 13 members and 10 Russian-led allies earlier this week after negotiators at COP28 released a draft pledge that included calls for a phase-out of fossil fuels.
In the letter, Ghais urged the group to ""proactively reject any text or formula that targets energy i.e. fossil fuels rather than emissions.""
Germany's climate envoy, Jennifer Morgan, suggested any call for blocking a fossil fuels deal would hurt smaller countries, vulnerable to sea level rises caused by global warming.
""Right now, countries here are fighting for their lives. The small islands, and most countries here, are engaging very actively on this discussion in a real way,"" she said. ""And I think it is not responsible to have a position that could mean would mean the life and death of many million people.""
""When I listen to the small islands who are in my ear and in my heart, and then I hear about this OPEC letter, I'm deeply concerned about it,"" she added. ""We're seeing very worrying tactics by the Arab groups here.""
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that countries that rely heavily on oil and gas remain resistant to major efforts to combat climate change.
Baerbock said the struggle is about seeking a ""way out of the fossil fuel world,"" in remarks on Saturday in Dubai.
""This is anything but easy,"" Germany's top diplomat said, as there are still nations that favor geopolitical importance and ""power politics"" over the use of fossil fuels.
Baerbock said that her focus would be on those countries that have gained wealth from fossil fuels.

OPEC's opposition to any fossil fuel phase-out deal drew a furious response on Saturday from French Energy Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher and Spanish Ecological Transition Minister Teresa Ribera.
""I am stunned by these statements from OPEC. And I am angry,"" Pannier-Runacher said from the climate conference, adding that ""OPEC's position endangers the most vulnerable countries and the poorest populations who are the first victims of this situation.""
Pannier-Runacher said she was ""counting on the presidency of the COP not to be influenced by these declarations, and to reach an agreement which affirms a clear objective of phasing out fossil fuels.""
Meanwhile, Spain's Ribera told reporters: ""I think that it is quite, quite a disgusting thing that OPEC countries are pushing against getting the bar where it has to be.""
""We need to be quite clear, bold, crystal clear that the European Union will be aligning with... a large majority of the parties in this conference to ensure that we have (a) meaningful and productive outcome connected to this phase-out of fossil fuels,"" she said.

OPEC hit back at the criticism, saying it was vital to agree on ""realistic approaches"" to tackle climate change.
""There is no single solution or path to achieve a sustainable energy future,"" OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais said in a speech read by a colleague.
""We need realistic approaches to tackle emissions, ones that enable economic growth, help eradicate poverty and increase resilience at the same time,"" the speech continued.
China, the world's largest oil importer, played down the row and said it was working to find a solution that was ""acceptable to all parties"".
""I think we've already had some progress on this issue and I believe we will have more progress in resolving this in the coming few days,"" China's climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua told reporters in Dubai.
""Because if we do not, if we do not resolve this issue, I don't see much chance in having a successful COP28,"" he said.
COP28 Director General Majid al-Suwaidi downplayed the OPEC letter, saying the UAE team running the UN summit has been meeting with negotiators to get an ambitious deal.
""I feel confident that we're going to get a good result you're going to be surprised about,"" Suwaidi told The Associated Press.
Saturday's angry response to OPEC from France and Spain came as protests at the conference center in Dubai were set to intensify, with a ""Global Day of Action"" urging countries to act more decisively over climate change issues.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-public-sector-workers-strike-wage-deal/a-67678397,POLITICS,Germany: Public sector workers strike wage deal 09.12.2023,"Germany's public sector workers have agreed on a large wage deal with their state government employers to help offset the increased cost of living, the ver.di union said on Saturday.
Some 1.1 million workers will see their salaries hiked by more than 11% by the time the collective bargaining deal ends in October 2025.
The deal, struck by the ver.di and dbb trade unions, will give workers €3,000 ($3,200) tax-free bonuses and raises of at least 5.5%.
The two unions had initially demanded larger raises of at least 10.5%.
The affected employees include staff at universities, university hospitals, state-run prisons and administrative offices, among many others.
An additional 2 million civil servants not directly covered by collective bargaining will also benefit as their wages are usually adjusted to reflect agreements with the unions.
According to Hamburg Finance Senator Andreas Dressel, who served as the lead negotiator in the talks, state governments will need to find an extra €23.9 billion ($25.8 billion) over the next three years.
The agreement is a ""challenging result overall"" but financially feasible, Dressel said.
ver.di chief Frank Werneke said in a statement that the wage agreement, ""could only be reached because tens of thousands of employees put pressure on employers with strikes across the entire public service sector of the federal states,"" 
""It was this pressure that made the agreement possible in the first place,"" he added.
The leader of the dbb labor group, Ulrich Silberbach, said he was pleased that workers won't have to go on protracted strikes to win a fair deal.
Like most countries, Germany experienced decades-high inflation last year in the double digits, and price rises have continued into 2023.
The cost of living crisis was spurred by supply chain issues that unfolded in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and was exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which spiked energy prices.
In a bid to keep up with inflation, German unions called some of the country's most disruptive strikes in decades.
Walkouts and demonstrations were organized at universities and other state institutions in recent weeks.
In April, unions struck a similar deal between public sector workers employed by Germany's federal and local municipal governments.
Last month, Germany's train drivers' union warned of fresh strikes after the breakdown of talks over pay and conditions.

https://www.dw.com/en/a-new-synagogue-for-magdeburg/a-67669750,SOCIETY,A new synagogue for Magdeburg 09.12.2023,"Magdeburg is the last German state capital to once again have a synagogue. 
The city's growing Jewish congregation counts around 400 members, according to its own estimates. A villa just outside Magdeburg, which was provisionally renovated and made available by the city has long served as their place of worship. ""It was practically a never-ending process,"" says Maria Schubert from the Synagogue Community of Magdeburg: It took ten years from the initial planning stages for the synagogue to its opening this Sunday, December 10.
It will not be the only synagogue in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. In October, a few weeks before the opening of the synagogue in Magdeburg, a new synagogue was opened in the state's third-largest city, Dessau.
The synagogue in nearby Halle became the site of a 2019 antisemitic attack on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur when a German far-right extremist with Nazi sympathies tried to enter and kill members of the congregation inside. His plan to commit a massacre was foiled when the door refused to open, and he killed two non-Jewish passersby.
Jewish life in Magdeburg dates back over centuries. Time and again, Jews were driven out and persecuted. The first synagogue was opened in 1851. This house of worship, which was later expanded and beautifully decorated, fell victim to the destruction of the 1938 pogrom when Jewish citizens were killed, synagogues and Jewish shops and institutions throughout the German Reich were attacked, looted, and set on fire.
The ""New Synagogue"" building in Magdeburg is located at the city center, less than 250 meters away from ""At the Old Synagogue,"" a small square surrounded by GDR-style high-rise buildings that features two slabs of stone that commemorate the 1,521 Magdeburg Jews who were murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust.
""It's a fantastic achievement that we have our own building, which is large, beautiful, and inviting,"" says Maria Schubert.

According to the municipality, the total cost of the building was expected to be around €3.4 million ($3.6 mil). The state of Saxony-Anhalt provided €2.8 million, while a charitable association contributed just under €500,000. The land for the new building was provided by the city.
In the end, the total cost was more than twice as high, due to the increase in construction costs, and — following the 2019 terrorist attack in Halle — numerous security measures which were added and paid for with federal funds.
From the outside, the windowless facade of the synagogue is reminiscent of the ""Wailing Wall"" in Jerusalem, the Western Wall of the destroyed Jewish Temple. But there are also surveillance cameras and strong fences. Above it all is a quote from the Bible in Hebrew: ""For My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations.""
The long-awaited opening, which was supposed to mark a new beginning, now comes after the Hamas terrorist attack against Israel on October 7, while the Israel-Hamas war continues and during a wave of antisemitic attacks and assaults in Germany.
Maria Schubert from the synagogue congregation told DW that she believes the situation in a city like Magdeburg is ""more stable"" than in larger cities. However, she says she knows of community members who have become more cautious and who, for example, will not be bringing their children to the festive and public procession of the Torah scrolls from the memorial site ""At the Old Synagogue"" into the new building.
Schubert says she is grateful for the efforts of the authorities: ""We feel very well protected and in good hands.""
In 2023, Jewish life in Germany has indeed become more visible. In a few months, a prominent Jewish house of worship is also due to open in Potsdam's city center. The scaffolding has already come down.
For Maria Schubert, the move to the new synagogue in Magdeburg is a sign of normalization. A sign that Jewish life is simply part of a secular city. Something that simply exists, just like all other religious life. ""We are no different,"" she says. ""We are just as integrated into the life of the city.""
Magdeburg may one day get another synagogue. For the past 20 years, the city has also had a smaller liberal Jewish community with 120 members. They are pushing for their place of worship.

https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-scholz-talks-ukraine-budget-crisis-at-spd-conference/a-67676951,POLITICS,"Germany's Scholz talks Ukraine, budget crisis at SPD conference 09.12.2023","German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Saturday pledged continued financial and military assistance to Ukraine as it tries to rid its soil of Russian invaders, saying decisions will be made that enable Germany to keep up its support.
Scholz's remarks at a party conference of his center-left Social Democrats (SPD) come as his coalition government faces major problems finding enough money to finance the government's spending plans for 2024 following a landmark court ruling.
The war in Ukraine ""will probably not finish anytime soon,"" Scholz said, adding that this made it important that Germany continued to be in a position ""to keep supporting Ukraine in its fight to defend itself.""
The chancellor said that Russia had abandoned all previous consensus regarding peace and security in Europe when it invaded Ukraine in 2022, and that it had to be made clear that ""borders in Europe can no longer be moved by force.""
For this reason, he said, Germany had to be prepared to do more ""when others are faltering"" — an apparent reference to political uncertainties in the US ahead of that country's presidential election new year. 
Scholz said that Russian President Vladimir Putin should not, and must not, reckon with any waning of German assistance.
After initial hesitation, Germany has delivered large quantities of weapons to Ukraine, including tanks and heavy artillery, and is now considered the second-biggest contributor to Kyiv's war effort, after the US.
Later on Saturday, the party members signed off on a foreign policy position paper declaring that the Social Democrats' old, fairly friendly policies towards post-Soviet Russia had been an error. 
The paper said it was a mistake to think that intensifying trade ties would help incentivize and accelerate Russia's democratization, and that this also led to Germany becoming too dependent on energy imports from Russia. 
""It was a mistake not to distance ourselves from the Putin system earlier,"" party chairman Lars Klingbeil said at the conference. 

However, he also defended the Cold War era ""Ostpolitik"" of former Chancellor Willy Brandt, that involved more diplomatic outreach to the former Soviet Union.
Klingbeil alleged that some of the conservative critics of the SPD were more interested in ""throwing dirt on Willy Brandt's legacy"" than in learning foreign policy lessons from previous German approaches to Putin's Russia. 
One statement in the SPD's 2021 election manifesto, in particular, had come in for criticism since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It said: ""There can be no peace in Europe against Russia, only peace with it."" 
That will now be replaced with: ""As long as nothing changes fundamentally in Russia, Europe's safety from Russia will have to be organized."" 
Gerhard Schröder — the former SPD chancellor most commonly associated with friendly ties to Putin, who went on to hold various positions with Russian state oil and gas companies after leaving office — was pointedly not invited to this weekend's conference. 
 

Speaking on domestic affairs, Scholz said his party would not allow large reductions in welfare assistance despite the budgetary problems.
""There will be no dismantling of the welfare state in Germany in such a situation,"" he said, while admitting that budget talks with coalition partners the environmentalist Greens and the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) were ""a very hard task.""
But ""we are not faced with an insoluble problem,"" he added.
""I would like to take this opportunity to convey the confidence that we will succeed. And that we will succeed in a way that is important for the future of this country,"" the chancellor told his party colleagues.
Scholz is to continue negotiations on the 2024 budget on Sunday with Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the FDP and Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck of the Greens.
Germany's budget chaos has been largely caused by a ruling of the Constitutional Court in mid-November that a move to redirect €60 billion ($65 billion) of unused debt from the pandemic era to a climate fund was unconstitutional. This has left a considerable hole in planned spending by the German government to combat climate change.
There are also differences within the three-way coalition over the so-called debt brake, with the SPD and Greens wanting it to be lifted once more, something the FDP rejects.

https://www.dw.com/en/russian-soldiers-wives-bring-them-home/a-67674569,CONFLICTS,Russian soldiers' wives: 'Bring them home' 09.12.2023,"Relatives of mobilized Russians sent to fight in Ukraine have come together to form a movement. They are organizing vigils and flash mobs, and appealing to the Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, demanding the return of their husbands and sons from the front. The authorities are trying to put a stop to their actions; they are worried the protests could escalate.
However, the authorities have also acknowledged that mobilization in Russia remains in force until it is ended by the president. Conscripts can thus be kept at the front indefinitely; there is no provision to rotate them.
The mood of protest has intensified following the news that President Putin has pardoned another criminal convicted of a serious offense, simply because he participated in the war against Ukraine.
Vladimir Putin's big annual televised question-and-answer session, ""Direct Line,"" is scheduled to take place on December 14. The Telegram channel ""Put' domoi"" (""Way Home""), which has 30,500 users and focuses on issues around mobilization, reports that the broadcaster has been deluged with questions from desperate relatives of mobilized Russian men.
""My husband and brother are at the front. They were called up at the start of the mobilization, and they haven't had any leave in nine months — they have to stay in the combat zone,"" says Tatiana. ""My son is asking why only his father has to fight. Of all the fathers of kids his age, his was the only one called up.""
Tatiana agreed to speak to DW, but she didn't want to disclose any personal information, and her name has been changed. ""It's not me I'm afraid for, it's my husband and brother — it could put them in danger,"" she emphasizes.
Tatiana says representatives of the governor of her region offered her husband and brother contracts with the Russian army.
""But that makes no difference. All of them are tired, exhausted; they have no strength and no motivation,"" she says, without passing judgment on Russia's war against Ukraine. Her inquiries to the authorities have all gone unanswered.
Meanwhile, the media are reporting that leading Russian military officials are trying to achieve successes on the front line before Putin's big TV appearance next week.
Relatives of Russian soldiers serving in Military Unit No. 95411 (Western Military District) claim wounded conscripts with minor to moderately severe injuries were among the soldiers sent to storm the city of Avdiivka, near Donetsk, in November. After this, more than 100 people signed a letter to Putin appealing to him to withdraw their relatives from the front.
In September 2023, a year after the mobilization began, family members of military personnel in many regions of the Russian Federation started attracting the attention of the authorities. They voiced criticism of what they described as ""indefinite mobilization,"" and called for soldiers to be rotated. In Krasnoyarsk, Novosibirsk, St. Petersburg, and Moscow, the authorities banned women from holding rallies; in Chelyabinsk and Nizhnevartovsk they promised to forward their demands to the federal authorities.
A number of women took advantage of the Communist Party's traditional demonstration at the Karl Marx monument in Moscow on November 7 to hold separate vigils in Moscow without waiting for a permit. Photos of the women holding placards spread quickly on social networks.
Then women in Ulyanovsk organized a flash mob. They covered their cars with posters expressing their discontent and demanding the return of their husbands, sons, and sons-in-law. Again, photos of the protest sparked intense discussion on social networks, but the authorities prevented the women from staging any further actions. Some of them were summoned by the deputy governor and told to remove the photos. Four others were visited by the police, who warned them that ""discrediting the army"" was a punishable offense.

This did not, however, put a stop to the demobilization movement overall. A manifesto and petition was published on the ""Put' domoi"" Telegram channel in November, after which regional chat channels with the ""Put' domoi"" name were heavily targeted by Kremlin-friendly bloggers. The bloggers spread claims that these groups of female relatives of draftees were set up by employees of the imprisoned opposition figure Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), with the aim of stirring up protest in Russia.
Vladimir Solovyov, a Kremlin propagandist, published a list of chat channels which he alleged were run by ""foreign intelligence services."" The ""Put' domoi"" channel was eventually labelled ""fake,"" but Telegram has not explained why.
In Novosibirsk, family members of mobilized men managed to reach an agreement with the authorities and hold a meeting at the local cultural center, though without independent journalists present. People were, however, allowed to take photos on cell phones. About 30 people attended the meeting. In a video, one of the women addresses Vladimir Solovyov, saying, ""We are not enemies of the people; we are the people. Our sons and husbands at the front are the people, too.""
The Russian opposition figure Leonid Gosman believes the protest is a tricky issue for the Kremlin, and one that could result in political changes in the country. However, he does not expect the authorities to yield to the women's demands, as this would be perceived as a weakness of state power.
""If the state were to comply with their wishes, other women would also demand their husbands' return. If it doesn't comply, there won't be mass protests, but the reputation of the central government will continue to suffer,"" Gosman says.
Many of the mobilized men are now experiencing their second winter at the front. This will further intensify discontent, according to the lawyer and blogger Nikolai Bobrinsky. He sees the actions of the women as an opportunity to increase awareness of the anti-war movement in Russia. Bobrinsky also points to the upcoming presidential elections in Russia next spring.
""It's important not to miss out on the elections,"" Bobrinsky says. ""Even if the official result is pre-determined, it can still be a time of impetus in society, and also makes it possible to hold rallies safely — if, that is, candidates are willing to speak about the mobilization at all.""
From September 2022 onward, a ""Council of Mothers and Wives"" of military personnel held vigils near the Military Prosecutor's Office and the headquarters of the Western Military District in St. Petersburg. The women demanded the withdrawal of their sons, who were doing their military service, from the Russian region of Belgorod, which had come under attack. The leader of the organization, Olga Tsukanova, was arrested several times, and in July 2023 was branded a ""foreign agent"" by the Russian justice ministry. After that, the organization was forced to close down.
Olga Katz, the administrator of the Telegram channel ""Vernyom Rebyat"" (Let's Bring Our Boys Back) with 30,000 users, wrote in November of a ""fragile dialog with the authorities.""
She was trying to convince officials and lawmakers that the service period for mobilized soldiers should be a limited one. However, the last post on her Telegram channel, by Katz herself, was left on November 20: Her 25-year-old brother Alexander, called up during the mobilization, had been killed at the front.

https://www.dw.com/en/guatemala-arevalo-calls-bid-to-annul-victory-perverse/a-67676240,POLITICS,Guatemala: Arevalo calls bid to annul victory 'perverse' 09.12.2023,"Guatemala's President-elect Bernardo Arevalo on Friday slammed a bid by the prosecutor's office to invalidate his win in an August runoff election, calling allegations of irregularities ""absurd, ridiculous and perverse."" 
The Central American country's electoral court also called the results ""unchangeable.""
The investigations brought against Arevalo by the attorney general's office are widely seen in Guatemala as an alarmed reaction by the country's political establishment elite to his pledges to combat corruption in the country.
Attorney General Consuelo Porras and senior prosecutor Rafael Curruchiche have been spearheading efforts to undermine Arevalo's victory, among other things alleging irregularities in the registration of his center-left Seed Movement party several years ago.
Porras, Curruchiche and Judge Fredy Orellana, who wanted to see the party suspended, are all on a US list of ""corrupt actors,"" and their actions have provoked mass demonstrations by Guatemalans calling for their resignation.
On Friday, prosecutor Leonor Morales said the election of Arevalo, his vice president and parliamentarians was ""null and void,"" with investigations allegedly showing that there had been ""anomalies"" in the vote count in the first round in June.
At a press conference on Friday, Arevalo said, ""This attempted coup is real and it has brought us to a crucial moment.""
""The coup perpetrators are trying to destroy the democratic regime and put an end to the basic right of Guatemalans to live in freedom,"" he added.
He called on Guatemalans to ""energetically defend"" the country from the bid to impede his taking office on January 14 as scheduled.
The head of Guatemala's top electoral court, Blanca Alfaro, said that no repeat of the election would be held, calling the results of the August runoff ""unalterable.""  
She said preventing Arevalo from taking office after he had been duly elected would be ""a break in the constitutional order.""
The United States, the European Union, the UN and the Organization of American States (OAS) have all expressed concern over the events in Guatemala.
The OAS secretariat said in a statement that it ""condemns the attempted coup d'etat by the Public Prosecutor's Office of Guatemala.""
""The attempt to annul this year's general elections constitutes the worst form of democratic breakdown and the consolidation of a political fraud against the will of the people,"" the statement added.
The OAS called on outgoing President Alejandro Giammattei, the constitutional and supreme courts and Congress ""to defend the institutions and constitutional order of the country by taking action against the perpetrators of this attack in order to preserve democracy in Guatemala.""
Giammattei's government has issued a statement saying that the transition to Arevalo was inevitable, but stopped short of directly criticizing prosecutors.
More than half of Guatemalans are living in poverty, according to World Bank data, with thousands leaving their homeland every year to seek a better life, often in the United States. Many blame corruption for the country's economic situation.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-angela-merkel-leaves-cdu-aligned-think-tank/a-67675437,POLITICS,Germany: Angela Merkel leaves CDU-aligned think tank 09.12.2023,"Former Chancellor Angela Merkel this month left a major think tank directly tied to her political party, the Christian Democrats (CDU). 
A spokesman for the Konrad Adenauer Foundation on Friday confirmed that Merkel had made clear last week at a meeting that she would no longer be available for the influential 55-person oversight board or for future members' meetings. 
It's the latest of several steps taken by Merkel, a four-term chancellor who left office in 2021, to withdraw almost completely from front-line politics.
The think tank had made no mention on December 1, when announcing the re-election of chairman Norbert Lammert and other senior members in a press release, that probably the most famous member of the foundation was leaving.
The organization confirmed the development after it was first reported in this week's edition of Der Spiegel news magazine, which goes on sale in print on Saturday. 
The Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung (KAS) is a think tank that's directly tied to the Christian Democrats but is also nominally independent from the party for legal reasons. 
It's named after Germany's first post-war chancellor, Konrad Adenauer of the CDU, who was in power when it was founded in 1955. 
Each major party with parliamentary representation in Germany can and does set up such an organization.
They are primarily state-funded. They are meant to provide and promote political education, research and insight at home and abroad. The groups tend to see themselves as influential in molding the intellectual and policy agenda of their parties.
Der Spiegel cited people close to Merkel as saying that the former chancellor had said ""I have simply grown out of this role"" when explaining her decision. 
According to the weekly, Merkel's entourage said Merkel was not trying to send any kind of message against the foundation or her party. They said she simply wanted to mold a new life that was completely free of political obligations. 
To retain a position on the foundation's board, regular attendance at its meetings is required.
KAS has only ever made one exception to this rule, for another longstanding former chancellor, Helmut Kohl, who suffered from severely declining health in the years before his death.

Merkel has said several times before and since quitting as chancellor that she intended to withdraw from front-line politics after leaving office. However, the extent to which she's cutting ties has raised eyebrows in some quarters. 
Der Spiegel cited one CDU politician, albeing speaking off the record, as describing it as a ""break"" with the party, and another calling it an ""ice age."" 
Merkel gave up the chairmanship of the CDU several years before quitting as chancellor, soon after announcing she would not run again in 2021. She also started to limit her public appearances to those necessary for a chancellor in her last term, for instance more often skipping partisan events like campaign rallies.
She's still a CDU member, quite probably still its best known member outside Germany. 
She announced soon after leaving office that she would be working on a memoir with a long-serving aide, Beate Baumann.
But her difficult past with current CDU leader, Friedrich Merz, has led to frequent speculation about how close to the party she remains, or will remain.
Merkel and Merz effectively vied for control of the CDU after Helmut Kohl's departure. Merkel won the struggle and Merz ultimately left politics, only to return once it was clear Merkel was leaving. 
He has been trying to position the CDU, now in opposition, somewhat further to the right since taking up the party leadership. Many considered Merkel a rather centrist CDU leader.
The pair's game of musical chairs continued last week: As Merkel left the Konrad Adenauer Foundation board, Merz was able to join it. 
That development was noted by the think tank in its press release.

https://www.dw.com/en/qatargate-one-year-on-eu-cash-for-influence-scandal-still-far-from-over/a-67670541,POLITICS,"Qatargate: One year on, EU cash-for-influence scandal still far from over 08.12.2023","December 9, 2022, started like any other cold, unremarkable Friday in Brussels. The following week, European Union lawmakers would head to the French city of Strasbourg for one of their regular plenary sessions, and preparations were underway.
But by the early evening, a political bombshell had dropped. Word had hit the press about a series of spectacular raids taking place across the Belgian capital and in Italy, uncovering bundles of apparently ill-gotten cash in the homes and offices of people either working in or closely linked to the European Parliament.
That day alone, eight arrests were made, and raids were carried out over 19 addresses in Belgium and Italy, according to the Belgian newspaper Le Soir. In the weeks to come, more would follow. A total of €1.5 million ($1.6 million) was eventually seized.
Daniel Freund, a German Green lawmaker and prominent EU anti-corruption voice, describes the first days after the exposure of the suspected cash-for-influence scheme that was quickly dubbed Qatargate as a blur, with information coming out in dribs and drabs.
By midday the following Monday, as the Parliament was set to reconvene in Strasbourg, Freund's office had been contacted by no fewer than 64 different journalists, he recalled. ""I don't think the parliament has ever gotten so much attention and for such a sad story, ruining the reputation of the house.""
One year on, surprisingly little about the case has been definitively established. Two suspects have apparently made confessions, but since then, Belgium's investigations have stalled.
Few would argue that the full extent of the network of lobbyists and politicians has been mapped out. So far, no one has been convicted, and many suspects maintain their innocence. Here's a guide to the twists and turns of a real-life political thriller that is far from over.
Of the eight arrests, the highest profile face at the heart of the scandal is Greek MEP and former European Parliament Vice President Eva Kaili, a sleek, poised ex-TV presenter.
Kaili's life partner, Francesco Giorgi, and his boss, former MEP Antonio Panzeri, were also detained on December 9, 2022. Giorgi worked as a parliamentary assistant but also separately for Panzeri. Both are Italian and, like all of the MEPs suspected in the sprawling corruption case, belong to the center-left socialist parliamentary group.
Panzeri confessed to involvement in January 2023 to get clemency and is believed to have been at the center of a complex network. Giorgi confessed even sooner but denied that his partner, Kaili, was involved in the scheme, according to leaked interview transcripts.
Two other MEPs were eventually arrested after having their parliamentary immunity lifted at the request of investigators: Marc Tarabella of Belgium and Andrea Cozzolino of Italy.
Also detained was Niccolo Figa-Talamanca, the head of an NGO that shared offices with an organization Panzeri runs. Panzeri has said that Figa-Talamanca was not involved, according to leaked interview transcripts seen by DW, though these only represent Panzeri's view. Figa-Talamanca has since been released unconditionally.

Another detainee was Luca Visentini, the former secretary-general of the International Trade Unions Confederation. He has told the media that he only accepted two donations of tens of thousands of euros to fund his campaign to lead ITUC.
All of them, save Panzeri and Giorgi, insist on their innocence. The web of potential names also extends far broader, including family members of certain key suspects and other figures in the European Parliament.
In essence, the charges — which, according to media reports, boil down to membership in a criminal organization, corruption and money-laundering — relate to peddling political influence.
The allegations against Qatar were the first to emerge publicly, hence the nickname ""Qatargate."" However, leaked transcripts of suspect interviews seen by DW suggest it may have started with Morocco and have also involved Mauritania. All three governments deny involvement or have declined to comment.
According to an investigation published this week by Politico, an American news outlet, leaked case files provide evidence of 300 alleged attempts to manipulate EU democracy. These included efforts to stifle critical resolutions (or statements summing up the Parliament's official position) about certain countries outside Europe.
What precisely the money allegedly paid by these countries was supposed to achieve remains unclear — whether it was supposed to secure certain policy goals or improve the image of some non-EU in Brussels.
Nick Aiossa, acting director of international anti-corruption NGO Transparency International's EU chapter, says that even though the Parliament's formal role in foreign policy was limited, he still believes it could be worth it for foreign states to drop a few million euros.
""Certain (non-EU) countries have put a great deal of value in the soft power of the non-binding resolutions that the parliament puts out in relation to external relations,"" Aiossa explained.
As well as having extensive press coverage and a closely watched public speaking platform, EU parliamentarians also meet regularly with senior officials from other EU institutions.
No one tied to Qatargate is currently behind bars. Panzeri, Giorgi, Kaili, Figa-Talamanca, Tarabella and Cozzolino were all released, most of them instructed to wear an electronic tag.
Kaili, who vehemently maintains her innocence, has even been allowed to return to Parliament — Freund, the German Green MEP, said he had seen her around. Although everyone was entitled to the presumption of innocence, Freund acknowledged seeing her in person was ""bizarre.""
The Greek MEP has, in fact, gone on the offensive, accusing the Belgian judiciary of overstepping in its investigations against her and even trying to rebrand the scandal as ""Belgiumgate.""
In recent months, lawyers for the suspects made compelling enough arguments to secure an internal inquiry into Belgium's investigations, delaying the Qatargate probe by some months.
DW correspondent Jack Parrock has followed the ins and outs closely over the past year. For him, the hope of finding the truth about the Qatargate corruption ring is dwindling.
""So many statements have been changed, so many leaks have come out of the investigation, and many of the suspects are now trying to clear their names or change the narrative around them,"" he explained.
""The story has become so large and nebulous that it can be hard to know what's true information and what's lobbying for a cause,"" Parrock continued.

For example, Parrock said there were still unanswered questions about the Belgian MEP Marie Arena, who has never been questioned or arrested and still has parliamentary immunity. ""Journalists, including myself, have seen the police investigation's file from before the initial arrests, in which she is heavily implicated.""
Parrock added that defense lawyers even believe they might be able to have the cases thrown out before they ever go to trial on the grounds of police and judicial malpractice.
""If that happens and no one is ever convicted, then the story sees yet another major shift in direction,"" he said. ""It will become far more about the competence, or incompetence, of the Belgians to prosecute crimes of corruption in their country, which hosts the EU institutions, and less about salacious personal stories of the suspects.""
There is also the question of the Parliament's institutional response. In the wake of Qatargate, the EU legislature brought about a modest package of reforms, like requiring all MEPs to disclose meetings with lobbyists rather than just certain kinds of MEPs. However, some believe the eventual response was not good enough.
Aiossa said much broader cultural issues within the Parliament were left untouched, including an unaudited generous monthly allowance for MEPs on top of their salaries and permission to hold side jobs that could pose a conflict of interest as long as they are declared.
""MEPs have developed, unfortunately, a rather toxic culture of impunity,"" Aiossa said.
Freund told DW he was disappointed with reform efforts in the end. Initial momentum to change straight after the scandal broke had clearly faded away.
There had been a ""moment where parliament was willing to ensure that this doesn't happen ever again,"" he said. ""From there on, it was it was pretty much downhill.""
Jack Parrock contributed additional reporting to this story.

https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-new-citizenship-rule-pledge-to-israel-stirs-debate/a-67673872,POLITICS,Germany's new citizenship rule: Pledge to Israel stirs debate 08.12.2023,"Effective immediately, those applying forGerman citizenship in the east-central state of Saxony-Anhalt must declare their support for Israel's right to exist. This ""commitment"" is part of new language that state interior minister, Tamara Zieschang, informed relevant authorities about in a ministerial decree this week.
Failing to do so would deny naturalization to foreigners who otherwise fulfill the necessary conditions for obtaining German nationality. Under the new guidelines, applicants would have to sign a declaration that they ""recognize Israel's right to exist and condemn any efforts directed against the existence of the state of Israel."" 
A more thorough check of ""antisemitic attitudes"" would also be part of the naturalization process.
Naturalization law is made at the federal level, but it's up to each of the 16 states to implement it. A similar Israel clause is currently under consideration in the Bundestag, the German parliament, which would then apply nationwide.
Would-be citizens already submit to a thorough background security check, and declare their readiness to uphold the Basic Law, which acts as Germany's constitution. Among other fundamental rights is equal protection for all people regardless of background or group belonging.
From Zieschang's perspective, the added emphasis on Israel is not redundant but further upholds rights of ""human dignity and religious freedom, which exclude hatred of Jews and antisemitic attitudes,"" she told DW.
While both the state-level decree and federal-level debate have been put forward by the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU), it has met widespread approval from other parties, including those in power. However, the three-party government coalition has expressed skepticism over how much such a statement could really do to combat anti-Israel sentiment. They also worry that Saxony-Anhalt's move would unnecessarily polarize an already tense situation.
Zieschang disagrees, seeing it as a way to help give Jewish life in her state ""more and more space to flourish.""

With its focus on foreigners, her decree however would do nothing to combat the biggest threat to Jews and other minority groups in Germany. Crime statistics regularly show that homegrown white supremacy far exceeds any threat posed by foreign sources. 
Saxony-Anhalt knows that all too well when a native-born German with far-right sympathies tried to shoot his way into a synagogue in the city of Halle in 2019. He executed his plan poorly, however, and turned his sights on two, non-Jewish bystanders — killing them both.
The man received a life sentence in 2020.
More than 2,000 citizenship applications are rejected nationwide for any number of reasons, often due to falling short of requirements. Although it has one of the country's smallest foreign-born populations per capita, Sachsen-Anhalt is already overburdened with naturalization requests. Processing times can take two years or longer in some parts of the state. Similar delays are common around Germany.
Zieschang grounded her decision in Germany's ""reason of state,"" a quasi-legal justification that makes Israel's security a national interest for Germany. The term was used by Angela Merkel, who as chancellor in 2008 used the term in an address to the Knesset, Israel's parliament.
The concept, however, is nebulous and difficult to make compatible in a democratic context. Germany's Federal Agency for Civic Education (bpb) associates ""Staatsräson,"" as it is called in German, more with ""authoritarian regimes.""

Nonetheless, almost all German officials are on board with declaring Israel Germany's ""reason of state."" Chancellor Olaf Scholz has doubled down on this commitment many times since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people there.
The German public, however, appears more suspect. Only one-third of those polled by Allensbach, a research institute, in late November agreed that Germany has any kind of special historical responsibility for Israel. In its current operation to destroy Hamas, 35% of respondents said they supported Israel's right to do so, while 38% voiced a desire for Israel to show restraint.

https://www.dw.com/en/why-does-venezuela-claim-a-large-part-of-guyana/a-67673252,POLITICS,Why does Venezuela claim a large part of Guyana? 08.12.2023,"While the Socialist United Party of Venezuela (PSUV) was promoting its plans to annex a large chunk of neighboring Guyana in the past weeks, Guyana’s government initiated an arbitration proceeding with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at the United Nations to resolve the longstanding border dispute between the two nations.
On December 1, 2023, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) instructed Caracas to ""avoid taking any actions that could change the current situation in the disputed areas of Venezuela and Guyana."" Nonetheless, President Nicolas Maduro and his followers — known as Chavistas in homage to the deceased party founder Hugo Chavez — secured a victory in the Venezuelan referendum,officially reported with well over 90 percent approval. One of the question voters were asked was whether Venezuela should ignore the ICJ ruling.
The majority response? Yes.
Venezuela seeks to annex the Essequibo region, the parts of Guyana situated west of the Essequibo River, encompassing approximately two-thirds of the country's land area. Guyana is almost the size of Great Britain. If Venezuela annexes the Essequibo region, Guyana would shrink to an area smaller than Scotland.
However, only around 125,000 people out of Guyana's total population of 800,000 reside in the Essequibo region. And the majority of Essequibeans live in coastal regions or in settlements on the banks of the Essequibo river near the Atlantic coast. The remainder of the population is predominantly composed of Indigenous groups and the so-called 'Pork-Knockers,' who, similar to Garimpeiros in Brazil, engage in illegal mining for gold and diamonds, Latin America Historian Christian Cwik from the University of Graz, Austria, told DW.
Essequibo is a part of the extremely inaccessible mountainous terrain of the Guiana Shield which extends from the coasts of Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana, stretching far into Brazil and Venezuela. The Guiana region has long been renowned for its abundant natural resources. In 2015, the US company Exxon Mobil discovered massive oil reserves off the coast of Guyana, with a substantial portion of it located in Essequibo.
The territorial dispute over Essequibo predates both states currently involved.
After Christopher Columbus arrived in South America in 1498, Spain asserted its claim over the northern part of the subcontinent.
""The Guyanas region, however, was never effectively colonized by the Spaniards,"" Cwik noted.
During the Napoleonic Wars in early 19th-century Europe, the Spanish Empire disintegrated.
""By the late 18th century, the United Kingdom had already begun annexing territories of the then-Spanish Captaincy General of Venezuela, including the island of Trinidad and parts of what is now called Essequibo,"" explained Michael Zeuske, a historian specializing in the Caribbean, in an interview with DW.
Following the Congress of Vienna in 1814-15, aimed at restoring order in Europe after the Napoleonic era, these occupied territories remained under British rule, contrary to the expectations that they should be returned to the Spaniards and the Dutch.
In the chaotic period of state formation, newly independent Venezuela initially neglected its claims on the sparsely populated territory in the far southeast of the country, inherited from the Spaniards, according to Victor Mijares, a political scientist at the Universidad de los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia.
An attempt to rectify this led to an arbitration ruling in 1899 and an internationally recognized border. However, ""Venezuela felt inadequately represented before the arbitration court in Paris and refused to accept it. When Guyana gained independence in 1966, this [Venezuela's] claim was transferred to the newly established state,"" Mijares told DW.
In the same year, the Venezuelan government reinforced this claim by establishing a military base on the Guyanese island of Anakoko in the Cuyuni River, which remains under Caracas' control to this day.
Amid the unpopularity of his government, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is leveraging the Essequibo issue as a nationalist motive to fortify his position, Mijares said.
""In preparation for the 2024 elections and struggling for international recognition, Maduro has reactivated these historical claims,"" he added.
According to Mijares, the frequently mentioned discoveries of oil reserves in the region have secondary importance in this context, given that Exxon Mobil made the reserves known in 2015.
Cwik mainly shares Mijares' view but notes that discoveries of oil reserves would allow the Chavistas to make the issue even more ideologically charged.
""Chavistas see Exxon Mobil as a representation of 'North American imperialism.' The current government of Guyana that follows liberal economic policies is also seen as the US' accomplice,"" Cwik said. 
Previously, Guyana was governed by left-leaning politicians who shared the same ideology with the ruling party in Venezuela, making Caracas reluctant to assert control over Essequibo, according to Cwik.
Another potential reason behind Venezuela's renewed territorial claims could be linked to the current global political situation, as pointed out by Cwik.
""Directing the US's attention away from conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East could give major powers like Russia and China, aligned with Venezuela, the opportunity to pursue their geopolitical interests,"" he said.
However, Cwik cautioned that it seems unlikely for Maduro to have made far-reaching strategic calculations.
Numbers highlight a clear disparity in the military power between the two neighbors: Guyana's defense forces claim to have approximately 4,150 active soldiers, while the Venezuelan army says it can mobilize up to 235,000 soldiers. Nevertheless, both Cwik and Mijares believe that Venezuela is unlikely to pursue its claims via military means, as indicated by the referendum.
Mijares cautioned that a military dispute would make Venezuela a less attractive place for foreign investors than it already is. Cwik noted that the United Kingdom still perceives itself as the protective power of Guyana. Furthermore, in late November, the US Department of Defense also declared its intention to send a delegation to the South American country. Guyana's Vice President, Bharrat Jagdeo, went as far as suggesting the possibility of it serving as a military base.
Both experts said that there could be minor skirmishes along the Cuyuni border river, as has been the case in the past. However, they emphasized that the challenging geographic characteristics of the Essequibo would make it difficult for Venezuela to take it under control.
'It's the deepest rainforest; hard to navigate even for small groups of people familiar with the area, let alone an army,"" Cwik said.
Guyana's government in Georgetown barely has control over what is happening in the remote parts of the area, he added, emphasizing Caracas would hardly have a better chance at governing it.

https://www.dw.com/en/indonesia-rohingya-arrivals-exhausting-local-villages/a-67672011,HUMAN RIGHTS,Indonesia: Rohingya arrivals exhausting local villages 08.12.2023,"Zuhara Bagem, a Rohingya asylum-seeker who arrived with his family in Indonesia's Aceh province at the end of November, was relieved when the boat was allowed to land at Bireuen beach.
""If he had stayed on that boat for another one or two days, my children would probably have died. We had not eaten anything for ten days,"" Zuhara told DW.
After disembarking, many asylum-seekers lay exhausted on the beach or sat with relief to again be on dry land.
Over the past few weeks, many boats overloaded with Rohingya people have been arriving off the coast of Indonesia's westernmost Aceh province on Sumatra island. While some of the boats have managed to land safely on the shore, many others were rejected.
The Rohingya are a Muslim ethnic minority who were mainly based in Myanmar's Rakhine province before hundreds of thousands fled military persecution in 2017 to neighboring Bangladesh. Most are accommodated in the sprawling refugee camps at Cox's Bazar on Bangladesh's southeastern coast.
However, due to dangerous and squalid living conditions at Cox's Bazar, many Rohingya have fled again by sea to nearby Muslim-majority countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia.
The asylum-seekers risk an 1,800-kilometer (1,120-mile) sea voyage to Aceh province, and locals have reported boats trying to land in remote districts like Bireuen, Sabang, Pidie and Aceh Besar.
Many of Aceh's residents tried to ward off the boats after giving them little food and water.
Earlier this week, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said that an estimated 400 Rohingya Muslims are believed to be aboard two damaged boats adrift without food or water in the Andaman Sea, according to reports in The Associated Press. The UN warned these people face death if nothing is done to provide them with supplies or organize a rescue.
Although many Aceh residents initially accepted the Rohingya people, the onslaught of arrivals has increased tensions in the poor, remote province.
Some boats are repeatedly pushed back to sea, before finally being allowed to land after multiple attempts, according to local DW reporters.
Although the residents of Aceh share the same Islamic religious background, locals are concerned about the large number of arrivals.
Mauliadi, a villager in Bireuen, told DW that he hopes the Rohingya will go ""back to their own country.""
""I do not want them to move to other parts of Aceh. We hope that the local and central government can guard the sea, so that the Rohingya are not left unescorted,"" he said.
Most Rohingya do not have citizenship status in any country, making attempts at ""repatriation""a convoluted and complicated process. 
Local resident and member of the Aceh's local government, Iskandar Usman Alfarlaky, said that tensions between locals and the asylum-seekers have only risen recently.
""When the Rohingya first came to Aceh, there was no resistance from the locals. In fact, the people of Aceh accommodated them with shelter, provided food, drink, and all other necessities,"" he told DW. 
""However, recently an increasing number of Rohingya have entered Aceh,"" he added.
""In previous cases, many Rohingya left the designated camps and ran away. Locals also reported negative behaviors, which collided with their social and environmental norms. This is a problem. It then triggers resistance from residents,"" Alfarlaky said.

According to Indonesian government data, there are currently 1,487 Rohingya asylum-seekers registered in Indonesia. The number is expected to increase as more continue to arrive.
At present, Rohingya arrivals are placed in temporary shelters in Aceh and Medan in North Sumatra province and Pekanbaru in Riau province.
These shelters, however, are well over capacity. Some of the migrants have already fled, with their whereabouts unknown.
Indonesia's coordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs, Mahfud MD, told journalists this week that the government will find temporary shelters for the asylum-seekers.
He added that authorities will also coordinate with the coast guard to prevent more boats carrying Rohingya arrivals from entering Indonesian waters.
""What are you going to do with those who have already entered? We must use a humanitarian approach,"" he said, adding the Indonesian government will continue coordinating with the UNHCR on the matter. 
He admitted that current shelters and the local Aceh government are overwhelmed by the influx.
Munawaratul Makhya, a UNHCR field officer in Aceh, said it is common for Rohingya boats to arrive on Aceh's shores in November and December.
""Indeed, the pattern is that it is always busy at the end of the year. There are many factors, especially the sea conditions,"" Makhya told DW.
She said the UNHCR and the local government are providing the arrivals with first aid, food, water and temporary shelter.
However, Makhya admitted that the continuous influx is beginning to test the tolerance of locals towards the Rohingya, which she said is generally high. 
""People in Aceh experienced a lengthy conflict. Then there was a tsunami. So, life as a refugee is not something strange for the people of Aceh.""
Local lawmaker Alfarlaky said he hopes that the central government will act immediately to deal with the situation before tensions rise further.
""Because of humanity, we [people of Aceh] are obliged to help. But the people here also have extremely limited capabilities to help, especially economically,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/decoding-china-how-agnes-chow-became-an-enemy-of-the-state/a-67671414,POLITICS,Decoding China: How Agnes Chow became an enemy of the state 08.12.2023,"John Lee, Hong Kong's chief executive, served as a police officer in the city for over three decades before entering into politics. During his various stints as a senior official in charge of the territory's security, Lee won the trust of the central government in Beijing and, with its approval, ascended in July 2022 to the post of chief executive, the official title of the head of government of the Chinese Special Administrative Region.   
Lee is now personally devoting his attention to an ongoing investigation into pro-democracy activist Agnes Chow. ""Unless she surrenders, she will be hunted for life,"" he said. The announcement immediately received the backing of Beijing.
""We support every effort by the Hong Kong administration and judiciary to fulfil their legal duties and apprehend the suspect,"" Wang Wenbin, a Chinese government spokesperson, said on Wednesday. 
Chow celebrated her 27th birthday last weekend, not in her hometown of Hong Kong, but in the Canadian city of Toronto.
She has been studying there since September 2023 and recently announced on Instagram that she would not be returning to Hong Kong to face the criminal proceedings.
""Freedom without fear is priceless,"" the student wrote. ""The future is uncertain, but I don't have to worry about being arrested. I can say and do what I want.""
Chow is facing numerous criminal proceedings in Hong Kong, on accusations ranging from endangering state security to undermining the principle of ""one country, two systems,"" which was agreed when Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997.

Under the framework, Hong Kong would keep some autonomy and freedoms, as well as a separate and independent judiciary, for 50 years following the handover. Safeguarding this special political arrangement was Chow's primary concern.
""It seems that the governments in Beijing and Hong Kong were not prepared for this step. They are now trying to use Chow as a precedent to intimidate others,"" said Sophie Reiß, China expert at the Berlin-based research institute MERICS.
Chow became politically active when she was 17, during the so-called Umbrella Revolution in 2014.
As a secondary school student representative, she took to the streets protesting a decision by Beijing to allow only candidates vetted by the Chinese government to participate in the city's elections.
The demonstrators called for genuine democracy in Hong Kong by reforming the electoral system and holding direct elections, as stipulated in the territory's Basic Law, even though it does not specify the exact time frame for direct elections. The mass protests, however, failed to get Beijing to change its policy. 
In 2016, a new party called ""Demosisto"" was founded in Hong Kong by young activists in the pro-democracy camp.
Chow was then 20 years old and became the newly formed outfit's deputy general secretary. Demosisto was not just a protest party, it adopted a wide-ranging program to fight poverty and promote equality, as well as introduce taxes on vacant apartments and a direct vote to elect the chief executive.
At the beginning of 2018, Chow contested in the by-elections for the Hong Kong Legislative Council (LegCo), which is the territory's legislature. The by-elections became necessary because Beijing had expelled six democratically elected representatives for deliberately falsifying the oath of office and thus allegedly not swearing allegiance to China.

But authorities disqualified Chow, claiming she wasn't a ""patriot"" as her party did not ""honestly"" support Hong Kong's Basic Law and the constitution of the People's Republic, even though she had declared support for the Chinese constitution in writing by signing the electoral application.
In 2019, the Hong Kong government wanted to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure and proposed an extradition law that would have allowed Hong Kong criminal suspects to be sent to the mainland for trial.
Hundreds of thousands protested against the bill for months. The authorities clamped down on the demonstrators. Due to increasing police violence against the demonstrations, protest leaders, including Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, called on Hong Kongers to besiege the police headquarters on June 12, 2019.
Several thousand activists responded to the call.
Two months later, Chow was arrested for ""incitement to participate in illegal assemblies.""
She pleaded guilty. A court in Hong Kong sentenced her to ten months in prison in December 2020.
In total, Chow spent six months and 20 days behind bars. When she left the maximum security prison ""Tai Lam Centre for Women"" in Hong Kong, she was celebrated like a hero by those waiting for her.
The massive public pressure forced the Hong Kong government to quietly withdraw the proposed extradition bill.
But this success was short-lived.
Not long after the withdrawal of the extradition bill, Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong — a remarkable move by the central government, in apparent violation of the principle of ""Hong Kong administration by Hong Kongers.""
The national security law criminalizes ""secession,"" ""subversion,"" ""collusion with foreign forces to intervene in the city's affairs"" as well as ""terrorism.""
Chow announced her resignation from the Demosisto party on the same day. The outfit was also dissolved at the same time.
""The security law was the decisive step towards ending the idea of one country, two systems,"" wrote Moritz Rudolf, of the Berlin-based German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP). ""With the security law, the Chinese leadership is now creating facts. The move comes at the expense of individual liberties and accelerates the spread of socialist legal concepts in Hong Kong.""

""The case of Agnes Chow has received an extraordinary response because a young activist has, to a certain extent, run rings around the Chinese government,"" said China expert Reiß. ""She is drawing international attention to her case and also to the situation in Hong Kong under the national security law, which is unlikely to go down well either in Hong Kong or in Beijing.""
Agnes was arrested by Hong Kong police in August 2020. She was accused of engaging in ""hostile activities with foreign powers"" using social media platforms. Her call for foreign sanctions against Hong Kong was cited as evidence. All of this is said to have happened after the security law came into force.
She was released on bail in 2021, after spending more than six months in jail, on the condition she check in with police regularly. She also had to post a bail amount equivalent to about €3,000 and a personal guarantee worth €27,000.
However, Chow said in a recent social media post that she will no longer respect the bail conditions, and will remain in Canada. She pointed to Beijing's tightening crackdown on dissent and protesters in Hong Kong as the reason behind her decision. 
Reiß, the China expert, shares Chow's view. ""Laws, legal proceedings and personal reprisals are used to put activists under pressure, even those who are abroad,"" he noted.
""The democracy movement in Hong Kong has largely been suppressed through intimidation, changes to the law and institutional discrimination. At the moment, there is no sign of the situation improving in the foreseeable future.""

https://www.dw.com/en/ioc-allows-russian-athletes-to-take-part-in-2024-olympics/a-67671827,SPORTS,IOC allows Russian athletes to take part in 2024 Olympics 08.12.2023,"Russian and Belarusian athletes who qualify will be able to participate in the 2024 Olympics in Paris, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Friday.
The athletes will only be allowed to participate in the event as neutrals. They cannot display any flags, emblems or anthems during their participation. 
""The Executive Board (EB) of the IOC has decided that Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) who have qualified through the existing qualification systems of the International Federations (IFs) on the field of play will be declared eligible to compete at the Olympic Games Paris 2024,"" the Olympic body said in a statement.
The IOC initially banned Russia — and its ally Belarus — from international sports events after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Over the past year, a number of Olympic sports have eased restrictions, allowing Russians and Belarusians to return as neutral athletes in individual events and under strict conditions.
Athletes from the two countries will now be allowed to compete in individual sporting events in Paris 2024, but no teams will be allowed.
""Athletes who actively support the war"" as well as ""athletes who are contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies"" will be prohibited from competing at the Olympics, the IOC said.
""Only a very limited number of athletes will qualify through the existing qualification systems of the (governing bodies),"" the IOC said.
So far, eight Russians and three Belarusians have qualified for the Olympics in Paris. More than 60 Ukrainians are among the approximately 4,600 athletes already eligible to take part.
Russia's Sports Minister Oleg Matytsin called the conditions ""discriminatory.""
""They are damaging the Olympic Games themselves, and not Russian sports. The approach is absolutely unacceptable,"" he said. 
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba condemned what he said was a ""shameful"" IOC decision.
""The IOC essentially gave Russia the green light to weaponize the Olympics. Because the Kremlin will use every Russian and Belarusian athlete as a weapon in its propaganda warfare,"" Kubla wrote on X, formerly Twitter. 
Athletes and officials from Ukraine, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have repeatedly urged the IOC to expel Russia and Belarus from the Olympics entirely.

Earlier this year, Thomas Bach, the IOC president, said he understood the call but added it contradicted the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the Olympic Charter.
""This puts us in a dilemma. If we set a precedent, it will destroy Olympic sport. We're talking about international competitions, which can then become a political pawn,"" Bach said.
The IOC did, however, suspend the Russian Olympic Committee after it ""unilaterally"" decided to recognize regional sports organizations in four annexed Ukrainian territories as members in October. 
The four regional organizations, namely in Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia, represent partially occupied and illegally annexed Ukrainian regions which, according to the IOC, fall ""under the authority of the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine.""
The step, taken by the ROC on October 5, therefore, ""constitutes a breach of the Olympic Charter because it violates the territorial integrity"" of the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
The Russian Olympic Committee has appealed that decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

https://www.dw.com/en/grand-theft-auto-vi-why-is-there-such-a-hype-around-the-gta-games/a-67668202,CULTURE,'Grand Theft Auto VI': Why is there such a hype around the 'GTA' games? 08.12.2023,"More than a year before its actual release, ""Grand Theft Auto VI"" (""GTA VI"") already holds a Guinness World Record. A 90-second trailer for the video game was viewed more than 90 million times within 24 hours.
That trailer was followed by countless reaction videos on YouTube, showing how much gamers worldwide are looking forward to the new title developed by Rockstar Games.
Previously, the simple announcement of the trailer was liked by 6.7 million people on Instagram.
Some gaming websites have set up news tickers. Breaking: Please remember, it's not about world politics, terrorist attacks or the latest in a war, it's just a video game…
But those who know the game, understand the hype. 
With each new release, ""Grand Theft Auto"" has established new standards for video games. According to Rockstar Games, the five ""GTA"" titles have been sold around 410 million copies to date, with the last part of the series, ""GTA V"" alone having sold 190 million.
In terms of content, the games are a satirical mirror of US society, with all its clichés and madness. It parodies how the American Dream can lead to excesses in a country with so many people obsessed with guns and in their belief in God or aliens.
In terms of gaming, the ""GTA"" series is somewhat difficult to classify because the games blend different genres. Shooters, racing games, simulations and action games are all rolled into one and tell bizarre stories in a lively game world.
Above all, they allow players to freely decide how they want to spend their time in the game. This was quite unusual, especially at the beginning of the series in 1997.
In the first ""Grand Theft Auto,"" players controlled the protagonist and the cars from a 2D bird's-eye view. Missions could be received from telephone booths (yes, so old school!). But it was also possible to simply steal a car, listen to the radio — there were seven different radio stations in the first part — drive through the city, chase the cops or take over a taxi and and ferry passengers safely from one place to another within a specified time.
The basic formula — an open, coherent and atmospheric game world, varied missions and numerous sideline activities — has always remained the same. But meanwhile, new technical possibilities have allowed the ""GTA"" universe to evolve, expanding the number of side jobs and leisure activities available in the gangster epics. These elements are not relevant to the story at all but add depth to the gaming world.
For example, in ""GTA: Vice City,"" players can deliver pizzas to increase the credit on their account; in ""GTA: San Andreas,"" there's the option to spend time training at the gym or to pop into a casino to play Blackjack. ""GTA V"" allowed players to spend time on a golf course, play tennis, do yoga, go skydiving, take part in a triathlon or in an illegal street race, among others.
Today, graphically opulent games in which players can explore an open world in the third-person perspective are nothing unusual. But that wasn't the case in 2001, when ""GTA III"" was released.
The title is considered a milestone in video game history, on a technical and visual level, as well as in terms of players' freedom.
It also launched a legendary trilogy in the ""GTA"" series: ""GTA III"" takes place in the early noughties in Liberty City, a fictional city whose real model is New York.
""GTA: Vice City,"" the fourth entry in the series, transports players to Vice City, a dazzling digital version of Miami in the 1980s.
That was followed by ""GTA: San Andreas,"" which is set in the early 1990s in the fictional state of San Andreas, based on California. The atmosphere of the different locations and eras is captured beautifully. The fashion, the cars, the pop culture references and the many radio stations all contribute to this.
""GTA"" games have repeatedly come under criticism for their high level of violence, explicit scenes, misogynistic content, vulgar language and racist clichés.
One needs to keep in mind, the improper behavior of the protagonists is a satirical portrayal of a bunch of criminals in shady environments, who are in such a hurry when they're driving that they'll run over passers-by. And, when in doubt, they'll prefer to fire a few bullets or use a chainsaw or flamethrower before talking to rival gang members or the police.
The game is clearly made for adults and does not belong in the hands of children.
10 years ago, the last part of the series, ""GTA V,"" was released. This game also raised the bar for video games. After ""Minecraft,"" it is the second best-selling video game of all time.
""GTA V"" once again takes place in the fictional state of San Andreas. The players slip into the shoes of three very different protagonists and experience a crazy, high-octane story of intrigue, revenge campaigns and robberies.
The multiplayer mode of ""GTA V"" is also set in the same world, but it has also been regularly updated with new content over the years.
Still, many fans of the series were desperate for a completely new adventure. Rockstar Games heard them and in February 2022, it announced for the first time that a new part was coming.
But some six months later, a hacker leaked dozens of videos showing scenes from the upcoming ""GTA"" game and reportedly threatened to publish the source code.
Even though the game scenes were from an early development stage, fans were disappointed. It was a disaster for the development team, who immediately had to justify why the graphics were so bad, and the surprise effect was ruined.
So certain aspects that were already known have now been confirmed with the release of the trailer. The setting of ""GTA VI"" is once again Vice City, an over-the-top version of Miami. Once again, the story takes place in the present. The protagonist Lucia and her boyfriend are a gangster couple, a modern version of Bonnie and Clyde, who make the streets unsafe. And as crazy as the characters in the trailer may seem, they are actually inspired by reality.
After the release of the trailer, the hype around the game seems to have grown even more. Video game fans are expecting nothing less than a masterpiece from ""GTA VI.""
But they'll have to wait a while. The game will initially be released exclusively for gaming consoles Playstation 5 and Xbox Series S and X in 2025.

He made the announcement at a ceremony in the Kremlin to honor the ""heroes of Russia."" 
This will be Putin's fifth run for the presidency, which he is almost certain to win. If he stays in his post, as is widely expected, he will serve as head of state for another six years, until 2030.

After nearly a quarter of a century in power, Putin still enjoys widespread support, even though he launched an immensely expensive war in Ukraine that has cost the lives of thousands of his countrymen.
Putin is 71 years old and has already used his influence to change the constitution twice, theoretically allowing him to stay in power until he's in his mid-80s. He is already the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin. 
If he serves another term, he'll beat Stalin's record to become the longest-serving leader of Russia since Empress Catherine the Great in the 18th century.
In 2008, when he stepped aside to become prime minister because of term limits, presidential terms were extended from four to six years. Another package of changes he pushed through three years ago reset the two-term limit to 2024.
Following this controversial constitutional reform, Putin could stay in power until at least 2036.
Putin's tight control over the political system in Russia means that his victory is all but assured, with those who could effectively oppose him either in jail or living abroad.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-to-extend-temporary-border-controls-for-2-months/a-67665728,MIGRATION,Germany to extend temporary border controls for 2 months 08.12.2023,"German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has said that the controls on people crossing into Germany at the border with Poland, Switzerland and the Czech Republic will be extended for a further two months.
Faeser told the German newspaper Rheinische Post that the measures which had been set to end on December 15 would continue until at least February, in an interview published on Friday.
""Our measures are working. Our fight against the unscrupulous business of people smugglers, who brutally jeopardize human lives, is successful,"" the Social Democrat minister said.
The measures — which were introduced back in October and extended to December 15 on Monday — saw extra police officers sent to the borders with the three neighboring countries to carry out checks on people seeking to cross.
The aim is to reduce the number of people migrating to Europe to enter Germany.
Although the Schengen Zone, of which all four countries are members, allows for visa-free travel between states, members have regularly introduced border checks to inhibit the movement of non-EU individuals — but specifically refugees — within the Schengen area.
Germany has carried out border checks on the border with fellow EU member state Austria since 2015.

The Ministry of the Interior said that some 9,200 unauthorized entries had been detected and another 4,370 had been prevented since the measures were introduced in October.
""This means that these measures are working and will continue to do so,"" a ministry spokesperson said.
However, one of Germany's main police unions, the GdP, was more critical of the measures and questioned how effective they were.
Andreas Roßkopf from the GdP told the Rheinische Post that police would not be able to significantly reduce the number of asylum-seekers.
It needs to be clarified ""whether thousands of police officers should actually remain at the border or whether they would not be better deployed for security in the cities and the asylum problem solved within the EU framework,"" he said.
The number of asylum applications reached a new record of 35,000 in November, according to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees.
Germany requires continued migration to balance out its aging population and fill gaps in the labor market, but concerns about illegal arrivals have led to a surge in support for the anti-immigration far right. 
In response, the center-left coalition government has taken a number of increasingly drastic steps to reduce migration.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-afd-in-saxony-classified-as-extremist/a-67665643,POLITICS,Germany: AfD in Saxony classified as 'extremist' 08.12.2023,"The regional association of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) in Saxony has been classified as a right-wing extremist organization, the state's Office for the Protection of the Constitution (LfV) announced Friday.
After Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt, the AfD in Saxony is the third state association to be given the designation.
""There is no longer any doubt about the right-wing extremist orientation of the AfD Saxony,"" said Dirk-Martin Christian, president of the LfV, the state's domestic intelligence agency.
In the 2019 state elections, the AfD received 27.5% of the vote.
A recent opinion poll put support for the party at 33%, about the same as the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
The Saxony branch of the AfD had been under observation by state authorities for four years.  
During that period, ""a large number of statements and political demands,"" in particular from senior functionaries and elected representatives of the party were collected, Christian said.
Taken together, these prove ""undoubtedly that the AfD state association is pursuing anti-constitutional objectives."" 
He added that the party represents ""typical nationalist positions"" and ""continually stirs up fears and resentment against foreigners.""
Saxony's AfD state and parliamentary group leader Jörg Urban criticized the decision, saying it lacked ""any factual basis,"" and was backed by ""purely electoral motives"" in the lead-up to state elections next September.

https://www.dw.com/en/closure-of-finnish-russian-border-sparks-protest/a-67661444,CONFLICTS,Closure of Finnish-Russian border sparks protest 08.12.2023,"At the end of November, there are only a few hours of light per day at the Raja-Jooseppi crossing point, the northernmost border crossing between Finland and Russia, located in the arctic Lapland region.
Shortly before the crossing was to be closed down on November 30, snow blanketed the landscape and at -10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit), the air was cold. There were a few frozen journalists standing around waiting for some asylum seekers to show up.
Earlier in the month, Finland had announced that it would close all its other border crossings with Russia amid rising political tensions. The government said there were too many migrants crossing into Finland — an EU member state — illegally. 
The decision prompted a number of migrants to make their way to the Raja-Jooseppi crossing, which is over 1,000 kilometers (ca. 621 miles) from the Finnish capital Helsinki and some 250 kilometers from the Russian city of Murmansk.
In the last week of November, more than 60 people applied for asylum in Finland at this border crossing.
On a guided tour of the crossing for journalists, Finnish border guards illustrated the typical flow of migrants. ""The refugees come from there,"" said Vesa Arfmann, the head of the border guard station, pointing in the direction of Russia. Then Arfmann led the group to a container where ""vehicles"" have accumulated. The border cannot be crossed by foot and there are many bicycles. ""These are now the property of the Finnish state,"" explained Santeri Komu, another border guard. ""Maybe they will be auctioned off.""
The journalists were also shown a heated hangar where migrants have to wait to be debriefed and asked for identification and why they are seeking asylum. There were also interpreters on hand. Many of the people arriving did not have documents but Komu said that two men had arrived recently with Yemeni passports.
By the time the tour was over, it was already dark. No migrant had arrived that day. And it was now too late: The staff at the Raja-Jooseppi border finished their work day and the crossing was closed.
The closing of the border will not only keep migrants out, but will also make it difficult for Finland's Russian-speaking population to move between the countries. They make up about 100,000 of the country's population of five-and-a-half million. It is not unusual for people to live in Finland and commute to the Russian cities of Vyborg or St Petersburg.
Viktoria Ilyina and Yevgenii Koshchevnikov were planning to travel from Lappeenranta, in southern Finland, to St Petersburg at the end of November because their five-year-old son Serafim was due to be operated on. The family moved to Finland one year ago but preferred to receive treatment in Russia: ""We have doctors there whom we trust and they speak Russian,"" said Ilyina. But the border closure meant that they had to postpone the operation.
They were also unable to visit Koshchevnikov's father who has cancer and recently suffered a stroke. ""I am very worried that my father's health will disintegrate, and I won't be with him,"" he said. ""I have thought about leaving my family here and getting there via Murmansk or flying from Helsinki to Istanbul to get to him.""
They are not alone with such stories in Lappeenranta, which is located 25 kilometers from the Russian border. About 5% of the population there speaks Russian. On November 19, a number of Russian speakers demonstrated in front of city hall after three of the southern border crossings to Russia were closed.
Ivan Devyatkin was one of the organizers of the protest. He has been living in Finland for 12 years. He studied there and speaks fluent Finnish. He also has a son in the country. He never used to take part in political demonstrations, he said, but the closure of the border changed everything. He dropped his job and has since been doing everything he can to persuade the Finnish authorities to listen to him and the other Russian-speaking citizens of Finland.
""It was like a stab in the back. A betrayal on the part of the Finnish government. That we were not taken into account, as if we, the Russian-speaking minority in Finland, didn't have our own interests,"" he said, explaining that he wanted to be able to talk to politicians. He has suggested at least that one border crossing be opened up in the south. His mother, his brother and sisters, live in Russia, he said. They had all been planning to celebrate New Year's together.
He staged a one-man protest for 30 hours to draw attention to the problem. That's how long it would have taken to travel by road from Lappeenranta to St Petersburg via the Raja-Jooseppi crossing in northern Finland when it was still open. He held a poster on which was written in Swedish, the second official language in Finland: ""I love Finland. But does Finland love me?""
The Finnish authorities have cited security reasons to justify the complete closure of the border with Russia. There was a significant increase in migrants entering Finland via Russia between August and November — the Finnish border authorities reported almost 1,000 asylum seekers had entered. There used to be far fewer migrants arriving in Finland.
The Finnish government has said Russian border officials deliberately allowed migrants without visas to enter the EU. Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo described this as a ""hybrid war"" in retaliation for Finland becoming a member of NATO.
""Our aim is to say to Russia: we don't accept this... And it needs to be stopped,"" said Finnish Minister of the Interior Mari Rantanen from the right-wing populist Finns Party. ""We really hope that the Russians understand it is for both our benefits if the border remains peaceful,"" she told DW.

The closure of the border has also sparked criticism in other countries because of fears that refugee rights are being infringed upon. Finnish Non-Discrimination Ombudsman Kristina Stenman said that people's access to asylum could be jeopardized. Currently, people applying for asylum in Finland can only do so at the Helsinki airport and at the country's ports.
Katya Morava, a member of the Lappeenranta city council, said that there were domestic reasons for closing the border with Russia: ""The current government is rather right-wing and populist. Its election campaign ran on the slogan 'close the borders' and it is now fulfilling its promise without concern about whether there are other categories of citizens whose interests and rights are being violated,"" Morava said.
""Of course we are aware that this decision is having an effect on people crossing the border point legally and in a normal way,"" insisted Rantanen from the Interior Ministry. ""We are very sorry about that and we hope that the situation gets normal as soon as possible, so we can open all the borderline, but it depends on Russia.""
The Finnish television station Yle has reported that the border crossings might re-open on December 14.

https://www.dw.com/en/olaf-scholz-the-most-unpopular-german-chancellor-ever/a-67667351,POLITICS,Olaf Scholz: The most unpopular German chancellor ever 08.12.2023,"It's an awkward time for the Social Democrat Party to celebrate itself. The center-left SPD gathers this weekend for its national party conference, in Berlin, on the heels of yet another major poll showing how unloved they are. 
If general elections were held now, the party of Chancellor Olaf Scholz would only receive 14% of the vote. That is another 2% lower than last month's figure and the lowest since June 2021, according to DeutschlandTrend, a monthly tracking of political sentiment among the German electorate.
The Greens, who support the SPD in a coalition, land slightly ahead at 15%. The government's third party, the business-first Free Democrats (FDP), would fall under the 5% threshold required to sit in parliament. That is also true of the socialist Left Party, which recently fractured into two groups.
The representative poll, carried out by the research group infratest-dimap surveyed 1,364 eligible voters between December 4-6 by phone and email. Of them, just 17 percent said they are satisfied with the SPD-led government. For Scholz himself, that figure is one-fifth. It's the lowest approval rating of a German chancellor in the history of the poll, which has been tracking monthly sentiment since 1997.
Scholz's defense minister and fellow SPD comrade, Boris Pistorius, is polling strongest of the major political figures listed. Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, of the Greens, enjoys the second-highest favorability rating, at 38%. And opposition leader Friedrich Merz, chairman of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is gaining support and polls in third place.

The current legislative period has been one of crises: the tail-end of the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia's full invasion of Ukraine, and the ensuing inflationary spiral and energy insecurities. Then last month, Germany's constitutional court agreed with the opposition CDU/CSU that the government's budget plans were illegal. It wanted to reallocate more than 60 billion euros ($64.7 billion) in unused credit, earmarked for the pandemic, for climate action.
The ruling has blown a huge hole in public finances, sparking a budget crisis with no clear solution. Broadly speaking, the government can either cut spending, raise taxes or declare a public emergency that would allow raising debt beyond constitutional limits.
Polling suggests that voters are as unsure as their elected officials on the least bad way forward. The largest number of them, 47%, are for cuts, while 35% are for more borrowing. Very few want to pay more in taxes. 
If cuts do come, two-thirds of voters appear comfortable with sacrificing low-income benefits, in a scheme known as ""citizens' money."" More than half would claw back savings in military aid to Ukraine. There is also a plurality of respondents, 41%, who would cut support for making the economy more climate-friendly.
The drop in support for climate action comes against the backdrop of the COP28 gathering in Dubai. A solid majority, 62%, expressed the view that Germany has done plenty to combat climate change and that other countries need to step up.
Still, 7 in 10 German voters think that lifestyle changes are essential to stopping climate change — a high number, but off its peak when the same question was asked in 2019.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-train-driver-strike-hits-rail-passengers/a-67651587,CARS AND TRANSPORTATION,German train driver strike hits rail passengers 08.12.2023,"Train drivers at Germany's national railway Deutsche Bahn have begun a 24-hour strike, according to the GDL trade union, which represents the drivers.
The nationwide passenger carrier strike started at 10 p.m. (2100 GMT) on Thursday and was set to continue until 10 p.m. on Friday. It is expected to cause thousands of train cancellations, with delays and disruptions set to continue through the weekend.
A freight strike began at 6 p.m. Thursday.
The strike is affecting long-distance and regional trains, as well as commuter trains in the cities of Berlin and Hamburg. 
The strike is the fourth to hit Deutsche Bahn this year and comes on the heels of a 20-hour GDL work disruption that forced the cancellation of nearly 80% of all long-distance and regional trains in Germany on November 15-16.
The GDL is seeking a reduction in weekly work from 38 hours to 35 hours with no reduction in pay, a monthly raise of €555 ($600) for employees and a one-time payment of €3,000 to offset inflation.
Deutsche Bahn has flatly rejected any reduction in hours, citing labor shortages, and has instead offered an 11% raise to GDL drivers.
GDL Chairman Claus Weselsky previously announced that negotiations with Deutsche Bahn had collapsed on November 24. Subsequently, the union began a vote among its members on whether to move from temporary ""warning strikes"" to full-scale strikes. The result of the vote is expected shortly before Christmas.
Although Friday's strike was expected to be the last of the year, Weselsky warned that ""longer and more intense"" strikes could be called in early 2024 if no agreement could be reached.
Deutsche Bahn called the GDL strike ""irresponsible and selfish.""
""Instead of negotiating and facing up to reality, the train drivers' union is going to strike for unfulfillable demands. This is absolutely unnecessary,"" said Deutsche Bahn Human Resources Director Martin Seiler.
A majority of the German public was also against the strike, according to a YouGov poll published on Friday. Of the 3,700 respondents, 59% were opposed while 30% expressed sympathy. Younger respondents generally showed more understanding than older ones.
The 10,000-member strong GDL is the smaller of two unions representing Deutsche Bahn employees, but it wields outsized leverage as it represents train drivers.

Baku will free 32 imprisoned Armenians while Yerevan will release two Azerbaijani servicemen following separate mediations by the European Union, United States and Russia.
Armenia's Foreign Ministry said Yerevan had ""responded positively to the offer of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to organize the meeting of the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan in Washington.""
President of the European Council Charles Michel described the development as a ""major breakthrough."" In a social media post, he wrote: ""Welcome in particular release of detainees and unprecedented opening in political dialogue.""
Both countries hinted at signing a peace agreement as early as this month as they take ""tangible steps aimed at confidence building” and Armenia even backed Azerbaijan's bid to host next year's COP29 UN climate conference.
The agreements were reached during talks between the office of Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and the administration of the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, with further ""confidence-building measures” planned with the ""intention of normalizing ties and signing a peace agreement.""

The neighboring countries have been locked in a decadeslong conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which had freed itself from Baku's control in a bloody ethnic conflict that accompanied the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, surviving with financial,
military and diplomatic support from Yerevan.
Azerbaijan reclaimed the region after a lightning offensive against Armenian separatists when Aliyev sent troops to Karabakh on September 19.
Following a day of fighting, Armenian separatist forces that had controlled the disputed region for three decades laid down their weapons and agreed to reintegrate with Baku.
Azerbaijan's victory marked the end of the territorial dispute, which saw Azerbaijan and Armenia fight two wars — in 2020 and the 1990s — that have claimed tens of thousands of lives on both sides.

https://www.dw.com/en/scholz-calls-for-solidarity-with-jews-as-hanukkah-begins/a-67661309,CULTURE,Scholz calls for solidarity with Jews as Hanukkah begins 07.12.2023,"Olaf Scholz lit the first candle on the first day of Hanukkah and told the crowd in front of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate that this year's commemoration is even more significant than ever.
""This is particularly important at this time,"" Scholz told the Berlin crowd on Thursday after lighting the first candle on a 10-meter (30-foot) menorah, adding that the fact that this event was happening ""in the heart of our capital"" is a clear message that Jewish citizens in Germany have a ""fundamental right to be visible.""

He said it was ""sad and frightening"" that members of Germany's Jewish communities are living in fear once again. He called the Hanukkah celebration ""a symbol of hope and confidence and a symbol of the inseparable affiliation of the Jewish faith and Jewish fellow citizens to this, our country.""
Several top-ranking politicians, including Bundestag President Bärbel Bas, Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner, and Israeli Ambassador to Germany Ron Prosor were in attendance, as well as relatives of Itai Svirsky, a German-Israeli who was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists. 
Scholz spoke of the attacks by  Hamas on Israel on October 7 and the number of antisemitic incidents in Germany since, which have reportedly risen by over 300%, to an average of 29 reported incidents a day. Police presence stepped up at synagogues and other Jewish institutions throughout the country.
""Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel was also directed against humanity itself,"" Scholz said.
Germany, like Israel, the United States and several other countries, designated the militant Islamist group Hamas a terrorist organization.
""We do not accept it when Jewish fellow citizens have to be afraid to live their religion, their culture and their everyday lives openly, when they exercise their fundamental right to be visible — a right that all people in our society have, without distinction,"" the chancellor added.
The host of the Berlin event, Rabbi Yehuda Teichtal, praised Germany and Scholz as beacons of democracy. The message of Hanukkah is ""light over darkness, democracy over tyranny,"" Teichtal said.
He called for ""more light, more joy, more Jewish awareness. That is our answer.""
DW's Nina Haase said the annual event was even more symbolic and poignant this year, given the ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza.
""This is an event that has been going on in Berlin since 2008,"" Haase told DW TV. ""It's a festival where the Jewish community in Germany celebrates its existence and stresses the fact that Jewish life is a part of German society's life.
""This year the organizers said that the message coming out of the event this year is more that Jewish life needs to be protected also in Germany,"" Haase said.
The eight-day Hanukkah festival runs this year from December 7 to 15, with a new candle lit every night at dusk.

https://www.dw.com/en/rising-ukraine-war-fatigue-endangering-us-eu-support/a-67154224,CONFLICTS,"Rising Ukraine war fatigue endangering US, EU support 07.12.2023","US President Joe Biden famously vowed to support Ukraine ""as long as necessary."" This was echoed by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and also stated in the final communiqué of the recent NATO summit.
But, since the Hamas terror attack on Israel on October 7, a new international crisis has evolved, distracting the attention of the world public. 
Further aid has been thrown into question in the United States, which is by far the most important supporter of Ukraine. According to the White House, the funds previously approved by the US Congress for Ukraine will have been used up by the end of the year. However, the release of new aid is being blocked by the Republicans in Congress. More and more of Republican legislators are expressing doubts about support for Kyiv or rejecting it altogether.
This would benefit Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently urged NATO countries not to slacken their support, saying Russia would try to exploit the situation in the Middle East.
In a dramatic appeal, Andriy Yermak, the head of the presidential office, warned that Ukraine would lose the war against Russia without US help.
The tide regarding Ukraine support had turned in the United States well before the current Israel-Hamas war broke out, said political scientist Johannes Varwick, of the University of Halle. There is ""competition for attention and resources. I don't think major players will stop supporting Ukraine now, but priorities will shift,"" he told DW.
Solidarity with Ukraine has been waning in the European Union. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban has announced he would veto both a further 50 billion euros for Kyiv and the start of EU accession negotiations at the upcoming EU summit in mid-December. Orban continues to maintain contact with Vladimir Putin and has consistently tried to prevent EU sanctions against Russia.
Earlier this year, the Polish government temporarily threatened to halt weapons deliveries out of anger over cheap Ukrainian grain imports. Slovakia, until now also a big Ukraine supporter, has changed its tune following the election of Robert Fico, who vowed during his campaign that under his leadership Slovakia would supply ""not one shot of ammunition"" to Ukraine, while calling for better relations with Russia. 
In the West as a whole, ""support for Ukraine has already waned, cohesion is crumbling, voices are growing louder calling for a 'dictated peace,'"" in which a weaker Ukraine would be forced to accept terms set by a stronger Russia, defense policy expert and conservative German lawmaker Roderich Kiesewetter told DW.
Roman Goncharenko of DW's Ukrainian desk told DW's ""To the Point"" program in October that ""there is disillusionment in Ukraine that the West has grown tired.""

Western weapons deliveries have enabled Ukraine to repeatedly achieve limited military success in its counteroffensives, but a breakthrough has so far failed to materialize.
Once again, Zelenskyy is asking for weapons from the West, such as combat aircraft. From Germany, he wants Taurus cruise missiles. But Chancellor Scholz is unwilling to supply them. And a majority of Germans surveyed by pollster YouGov earlier this year, support his decision.
The constant hesitation is precisely the problem, Kiesewetter said. ""The liberation offensive is being hampered by the West itself because too little is being delivered too late,"" he argued. ""A sufficient quantity of superior and precise weapons like Taurus could turn the tide.""
The Kremlin is playing for time, hoping that Donald Trump will win the presidential election in 2024 and that this will spell an end to US support for Ukraine.
For the EU to make up the difference would be ""simply not possible in terms of scale,"" said Johannes Varwick. He said the US had provided nearly €50 billion euros in military aid, while Germany, the second most important supporter, has provided about €12 billion.

""If the US stops or massively reduces its support, Ukraine will have a problem that cannot be absorbed by Europeans."" EU foreign affairs envoy Josep Borrell said.
War fatigue in the West is putting pressure on politicians and diplomats to seek an end to the conflict through negotiations. Political scientist Johannes Varwick believes a negotiated peace is inevitable anyway. In the process, he says, there must also be negotiations ""about territorial changes in Ukraine, about Ukraine's neutrality."" ""All this belongs on the table today rather than tomorrow. In fact, it should have happened yesterday. But now is the time to launch such initiatives.""
DW's Goncharenko said a solution based on the ""land for peace"" formula would have no chance of being accepted in Ukraine: ""Too much has happened. The suffering has been too great. That would be a reward for Russia.""

https://www.dw.com/en/exiled-leader-says-china-is-erasing-tibetan-culture/a-67659867,POLITICS,Exiled leader says China is erasing Tibetan culture 07.12.2023,"Penpa Tsering, the head of an India-based organization known as the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), which serves as Tibet's government-in-exile, has told DW that the latest round of ""back-channel"" negotiations with China, which are focused on a range of issues, including the return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet, have been taking place since the start of 2023.
In an interview in Vienna, Tsering said the talks were still at an early stage, but stressed that both sides wanted to reestablish formal contact.
The statement is significant as formal talks between China's government and the CTA stalled in 2010. Tsering declined to name the officials involved in the talks.
After coming to power in 1949, China's Communist Party overthrew the Buddhist theocracy that was running Tibet in 1951. 
Beijing says Tibet has been a part of China for many centuries, a claim the government uses to support its sovereignty over the territory. But many Tibetans reject China's claim, pointing to periods of history when Tibet enjoyed self-rule. 
Following a failed uprising against China in 1959, the Dalai Lama, the head of the dominant school of Tibetan Buddhism, fled into exile. He has since been living in Dharamsala, a hillside city in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. The CTA is also based in the city. 

Beijing doesn't recognize the CTA and has denounced it and the Dalai Lama for ""attempting to separate Tibet from China.""
For years, Chinese authorities have also slammed the exiled spiritual leader as a ""separatist"" and a ""wolf in monk's robes."" But the Dalai Lama has repeatedly said he is only seeking genuine autonomy for Tibet, not separation from China.
Against this backdrop, Harsh V. Pant, professor of international relations at King's College London, said it would be very surprising if something came out of these talks. 
""Such back-channel discussions in various forms have been going on for quite some time, but so far there has been nothing to show for them,"" he said. 
Pant said Chinese President Xi Jinping, after opening several fronts at the global level, was now trying to take a step back. 
""There has been a stronger-than-expected pushback from various global players and the Chinese economy is weakening, so Xi has an incentive to loosen up,"" he said. However, he added, ""it is highly unlikely that Tibet would be an area where Xi would do it."" 
Many Tibetans fear that their Buddhist culture is at risk of erosion by Chinese political and economic domination.
Tsering recently visited the United States, Canada, Latin America and Europe to raise awareness about the human rights situation in Tibet.
He painted a grim picture of life there, accusing Chinese authorities of imposing monoculturalism on Tibetans, eradicating ethnic identities and suppressing political activities. 
He also denounced Beijing for creating a constant state of fear through extensive surveillance, anti-espionage laws and the widespread collection of sensitive data, among other measures. 
Furthermore, China is accused of running colonial-style boarding schools in Tibet, where children are separated from their families, from their culture, from their language and from their religion. 
The United States even said in August it was imposing visa sanctions on Chinese officials for pursuing the ""forced assimilation"" of children in Tibet, where UN experts say 1 million children have been separated from their families.
Tsering said the Chinese government wanted to avoid ethnic conflict by assimilating young Tibetans. 
""I think they are looking for a way to manage the situation in Tibet without losing face,” Tsering said. ""They know that the status quo is unsustainable.”
Tsering also spoke about the question of the Dalai Lama's succession. 
He said the CTA was ""not concerned” about the Chinese government's attempts to control the process of selecting the successor. 
The Dalai Lama, now 88, has already said he could break Buddhist tradition and pick his own reincarnation or declare the institution over, fearing that officially atheist Beijing would identify and groom a pliant successor.

Tsering said China's government ""does not believe in life after death"" and officials ""do not understand"" the Tibetan Buddhist concept of reincarnation. 
""How can an atheist government which does not believe in religion be responsible for finding the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama?"" he said.
Tsering also called for greater international support for the Tibetan cause, noting that the United States is the only country that has a law on Tibet, the Tibetan Policy and Support Act passed by the US Congress in 2020. 
The legislation makes it official US policy that the succession of Tibetan Buddhist leaders, including the succession of the Dalai Lama, be left solely to Tibetan Buddhists to decide, without interference from China's government.
Stating that the European Union is ""fractured in many ways,"" Tsering urged the bloc to have a more uniform foreign and trade policy toward China. 
Tsering said he was in regular contact with the about 150,000 Tibetans in diaspora communities worldwide. They represent just 2% of the overall Tibetan population. About 6.3 million Tibetans remain in China. 
He said some Tibetans in exile were growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress in dialogue with the Chinese government. 
Tsering remains ""hopeful"" for the future of the Tibetan cause.  
""There is an unwavering spirit of Tibetans inside and outside Tibet,"" Tsering said, ""and we will never give up on our struggle.”

https://www.dw.com/en/denmark-parliament-adopts-bill-prohibiting-quran-burnings/a-67659274,SOCIETY,Denmark parliament adopts bill prohibiting Quran burnings 07.12.2023,"The Danish parliament on Thursday approved legislation that would effectively prohibit Quran burnings in the northern European country.
The law criminalizes the ""inappropriate treatment of writings with significant importance for a recognized religious community.""
The bill was passed with 94 votes in favor by the 179-member Danish parliament, also known as the Folketing. Seventy-seven votes were cast against the legislation.
Burning, tearing, or defiling religious texts in public could land people with a fine or up to two years behind bars. Destroying a holy text on video and disseminating the footage online could also put offenders in jail.  
The Danish Justice Ministry has said the law aims to combat the ""systematic mockery"" that raises terror threat levels in Denmark.  
""We must protect the security of Denmark and Danes,"" Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard said. ""That is why it is important that we now get better protection against the systemic descretations we have seen for a long time."" 
Quran burnings in Denmark and Sweden this summer triggered outrage in the Muslim world. In late July, Iraqis tried to march to the Danish Embassy in Baghdad's Green Zone after Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr urged action due to a Danish Quran burning.   
Critics of the bill passed by the parliament on Thursday say it restricts freedom of expression in the Scandinavian nation.  
""History will judge us harshly for this and with good reason,"" Inger Stojberg of the right-wing anti-immigration Denmark Democrats party said in response to the bill's passage. ""What it all comes down to is whether a restriction on freedom of speech is determined by us, or whether it is dictated from the outside.""
Danish lawmakers on the left side of the political spectrum also criticized the bill.
""Does Iran change its legislation because Denmark feels offended by something an Iranian would do? Does Pakistan? Does Saudi Arabia?"" Karina Lorentzen of the leftist Socialist People's Party said. ""The answer is no.""     
The bill, backed by Denmark's center-right coalition government, was originally introduced in August and then amended in an attempt to address freedom of speech concerns.   
Before the latest version of the bill goes into law, it needs to be signed by Danish monarch Queen Margrethe. That will likely occur later this month.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-budget-chaos-no-vote-on-2024-spending-this-year/a-67659587,POLITICS,German budget chaos: No vote on 2024 spending this year 07.12.2023,"The German parliament will not have time to vote on the country's 2024 budget before the end of the year, a senior lawmaker from Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD) wrote in a text message sent to the party members and seen by several news agencies on Thursday.
""Although we have done as much as possible from our side, the budget for the year 2024 can no longer be finalized in time this year,"" wrote Katja Mast, a senior SPD lawmaker.
However, Mast added, referring to discussions in the party leadership that Scholz ""is confident that a result can be achieved in the coming days.""

Scholz's three-party coalition with the environmentalist Greens and business-focused FDP is under huge pressure to resolve the country's budget crisis, which followed a landmark court ruling that struck down some of the government's spending plans.
Now the coalition has to find a solution for the 2024 budget, which is €17 billion ($18.3 billion) short.
Scholz is currently negotiating with Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck (Greens) and Finance Minister Christian Lindner (FDP). The talks are to continue on Friday. The SPD and Greens want the so-called debt brake to be suspended again, which the FDP rejects.
The SPD said it expected at least one meeting of the budget committee before Christmas to work out the details of the budget. Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said on Wednesday that he expected a Cabinet decision before Christmas.
The problem is, even if a deal is reached, there will not be time for the financial plans to go through parliament this year.
""This is however not a crisis,"" German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said, playing down the need to get the budget through parliament before the end of the year. 
""I have realized that the coalition partners have very ambitious timetables,"" Lindner said on Thursday in Brussels. 
He said that a political agreement on the structure of next year's budget was likely to come in a couple of days. ""The work has not yet been fully completed,"" Lindner added.
If no agreement is reached, the coalition could collapse, but most observers say it is in the interest of all parties to reach an agreement and stay in power. A temporary budget for next year could be implemented if no agreement is reached.

https://www.dw.com/en/uk-accuses-russia-of-yearslong-cyberespionage-campaign/a-67658991,POLITICS,UK accuses Russia of yearslong cyberespionage campaign 07.12.2023,"The British government on Thursday accused Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) of waging a sustained cyberespionage campaign against senior politicians, civil servants, journalists and nongovernmental organizations.
""Russia's attempts to interfere in UK politics are completely unacceptable and seek to threaten our democratic processes,"" Foreign Secretary David Cameron said in a statement.
""In sanctioning those responsible and summoning the Russian ambassador today, we are exposing their malign attempts at influence and shining a light on yet another example of how Russia chooses to operate on the global stage,"" he said.
According to the Foreign Office, two Russian agents have been sanctioned for their alleged involvement in preparing so-called spear-phishing campaigns and ""activity intended to undermine the UK.""
The British government claimed that a hacking group called Cold River, working on behalf of the FSB, targeted British politicians, journalists, and nonprofit groups from at least 2015 to 2023, with some attacks resulting in the leak of documents.
Foreign Office minister Leo Docherty told lawmakers that a cybergroup created false identities to impersonate legitimate contacts and compromise email accounts in the public sector.
""The targeting of this group is not limited to politicians but public-facing figures and institutions of all types. We have seen impersonation and attempts to compromise email accounts in the public sector, universities, media, NGOs and wider civil society,"" Docherty said.
Authorities said the group was responsible for the 2018 hacking of the Institute for Statecraft, a UK think tank that worked on defending democracy against disinformation and the leaking of US-UK trade documents ahead of the 2019 British general election.

The Cold River group, which is also known as ""Callisto"" or ""Star Blizzard,"" first appeared on intelligence professionals' radar after it targeted Britain's Foreign Office in 2016. It was also behind the leak of private emails belonging to former British spymaster Richard Dearlove in 2022.
Cold River sits within the FSB's ""Center 18,"" one of two known cyber-espionage units at the intelligence agency, according to cybersecurity experts.
A Western official, speaking to Reuters news agency on condition of anonymity, said the group was still very active and was part of Moscow's ""Active Measures,"" intelligence-gathering ecosystem. It is a Cold War-era term used by the Soviet Union to describe covert political disinformation campaigns.
Meanwhile, the Russian embassy in London has said that Moscow has no reason to trust British insinuations about cyber attacks on British democracy in the absence of concrete evidence. Russia routinely denies accusations of cyber espionage.

https://www.dw.com/en/emboldened-iran-silences-critics-as-world-looks-elsewhere/a-67859305,HUMAN RIGHTS,Emboldened Iran silences critics as world looks elsewhere 30.12.2023,"As least 690 prisoners were executed in Iran in 2023, as of December 1, according to the human rights organizations Center for Human Rights in Iran and the Oslo-based Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, whose data was based on official Iranian statistics.
However, rights organizations believe a considerable number of unreported executions have been carried out hidden from the public eye and often only come to light years later, when bereaved relatives have the courage to speak out.
""The world is distracted by the Gaza war. The Islamic Republic of Iran is taking maximum advantage of this situation to crack down on its critics, especially with executions that I would characterize as state murder for revenge, and to intimidate society through violence,"" Saeid Dehghan, an Iranian human rights activist, told DW.
Dehghan, who has lived in Canada since 2022, has founded a worldwide network of Iranian lawyers. He heads a legal center called Parsi Law, which provides legal advice to people in Iran. The center also supports international organizations, such as UN bodies, in their efforts to improve human rights in Iran. 
""The sad reality is that as soon as the streets in Iran are emptied of protesters, the country is forgotten and the global community returns to business as usual with the Islamic Republic,"" said Dehghan. 
""Human rights activists understand that every country worldwide pursues its own interests. Nevertheless, the massive oppression in Iran must not be ignored. Especially not by politicians in Western countries, where human rights are one of the fundamental principles of politics,"" he added.
At least eight people who were arrested during nationwide women's rights demonstrations under the slogan ""Woman, Life, Freedom"" have been sentenced to death in sham trials and executed in recent months.
One of them was 21-year-old Milad Zohrevand. On November 30, he was executed without warning, and without the opportunity to say goodbye to his family. According to human rights activists, Zohrevand was not allowed access to a lawyer or family visits during his imprisonment. 
""Slaughter and killing do not only happen in war,"" wrote imprisoned Iranian Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi in a letter to UN Human Rights Commission.

In this open letter, which Mohammadi's husband shared with DW, she asks the UN human rights commissioner to take urgent, decisive and swift action to stop executions in Iran. 
""In this world where everything is globalized, is humanity an exception? Is it enough to make a statement on paper? Is the global will to stop the unsafe and widespread executions in Iran's cities paralyzed by empty and baseless excuses?"" Mohammadi wrote.
Since December 3, Iranian authorities have cut off all of Mohammadi's connections with the outside world. She is not allowed to make phone calls or receive visitors. Her voice, and that of other critics, has been silenced. 
On December 2, Iranian rapper Toomaj Salehi was arrested several days after being released from prison. The judiciary justified the arrest with statements he made in a video allegedly ""spreading lies and violation of public opinion."" 
The musician had posted a video sharing details of how he had been arrested and harassed. Salehi was initially arrested for showing solidarity with the nationwide women's rights protests in the fall of 2022, and was later sentenced to six years in prison.
Journalists and media professionals in Iran are under enormous pressure not to publish any critical articles. 
At the end of November, the public prosecutor's office in Tehran took legal action against the newspaper Etemad, which is cautiously critical of the government. 
The newspaper had published a secret document showing an excerpt from a ministerial directive for ""arrests"" and ""other measures"" against women who refuse to wear the obligatory headscarf in public.

According to the document, the duties of Iran's ""morality police"" include taking photos and videos of women to ensure dress code compliance in the ""metro areas,"" including ""inside the wagons."" 
The newspaper published this document after Iran's interior minister claimed on November 22 that female morality watchdogs are citizens who want to ""fulfill their religious duties and prohibit evil."" 
The last victim of this ostensible religious sense of duty was a 16-year-old schoolgirl, who was on her way to school at the beginning of October and wasn't wearing a headscarf. According to a source who spoke with the British newspaper The Guardian, she was attacked by a morality police officer on the subway. 
Instead of going to school that day, she fell into a coma and was taken to hospital. She later died and was buried at the end of October.

https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-prepares-for-another-rowdy-new-years-eve/a-67852283,SOCIETY,Berlin prepares for another rowdy New Year's Eve 30.12.2023,"In Germany, Christmas is all about contemplation and family. New Year's Eve, however, is all about partying.
In Berlin, up to 65,000 people are expected on the ""party mile"" at the Brandenburg Gate alone, where a large stage has been under construction for days. The annual ""Celebrate at the Gate"" show will feature a food truck festival, and numerous musicians are performing. The show will be broadcast live on TV, and of course, the whole thing will be crowned with a big firework display at midnight.
It all sounds like exuberant merriment, but no one can be sure of how much fun it will be in view of the increased risk of terrorist attacks. Security measures are elaborate, and access to the cordoned-off area will only be possible with a prepaid ticket. Bags and backpacks won't be allowed, and fireworks, food, drinks and flyers are also outlawed. And political sloganeering has been banned at party, especially amid Israel's ongoing war with Hamas.

The Berlin police have said there is an increased risk of violence on New Year's Eve due to the conflict in the Middle East. Berlin Police Chief Barbara Slowik has spoken of an ""immense need to protect Jewish and Israeli people,"" following numerous pro-Palestinian demonstrations in major German cities in the last few weeks.
Slowik has also described the heightened emotions ""due to the conflict in the Middle East,"" saying that, with a view to New Year's Eve, ""we are certainly assuming that these emotions will also be acted out on the streets.""
The Berlin police, fire departments and medical services are all on alert. Throughout the year, emergency and rescue services have been targeted by attacks. In a nationwide survey conducted by the German Fire Service Association, around half of the firefighters surveyed said they had been insulted, abused, threatened, or had experienced direct violence while on duty in the past two years.
Last New Year's Eve, rescue and emergency services were attacked with firecrackers and rockets in several cities in Germany. In Berlin, rescue workers were even lured into ambushes, said Slowik. And nobody expects things to be any less aggressive this year. Federal Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has also expressed concern that ""blind rage and senseless violence"" could once again break out in some cities on New Year's Eve.

Police unions have called for tougher action against attackers. ""Ever since last year's violent excesses in Berlin, but also in numerous places in the Ruhr region and even in Bonn, which is actually a peaceful city, everyone knows that something has gone wrong in our society,"" said Jochen Kopelke, head of the GdP police union, in an interview with the Rheinische Post newspaper. ""We must finally react.""
For months, police officers in Berlin have been more visible in what they've deemed as problematic neighborhoods. Meetings have been organized in schools and youth clubs, where police and firefighters have reached out to youth to promote understanding for their work. Authorities have even sent out letters to parents through the schools to ask them for their help.
""Please talk to your children in advance, and tell them that we also want to be treated with respect and tolerance and start the new year unharmed,"" the letter reads.
Berlin police have prepared for their largest New Year's Eve operation in decades. An additional 2,500 police officers from Berlin and other states are on the streets, and 500 federal police officers have also been stationed at suburban and long-distance train stations.
Another 1,000 police officers are set to be on duty in police stations and patrol cars. In some cases, the fire department will be accompanied by police protection, and rioters are to be arrested immediately.
The public prosecutor's office has also added extra shifts, and Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner has announced they are planning decisive action. ""Anyone who attacks the police and fire department must expect a forceful response from the state,"" he said.
As a precautionary measure, private fireworks have been banned in three Berlin districts where last year people repeatedly engaged in street battles with pyrotechnics.
If it had been up to environmentalists and the police union, Berlin would have imposed a citywide ban on fireworks and firecrackers. Instead, after the bans in the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, sellers of pyrotechnics broke new records last year, with around €180 million ($199 million) worth of fireworks set off to mark the end of 2022. Germany's Association of the Pyrotechnic Industry expects the demand for fireworks to be just as high this year.
In addition to the legal rockets and firecrackers that have been on sale since December 28, there are plenty of illegal explosives in circulation, especially in Berlin. The border with Poland isn't far away, and unauthorized fireworks with a much higher explosive force are freely available there.
Instead of the standard black explosive powder, these fireworks use a stronger and faster-reacting substance that can result in uncontrollable explosions. Some of the projectiles contain small hard parts which, like bullets, can cause extremely serious injuries, possibly leading to amputations and death.
Hospitals in Berlin are already preparing for a busy night.

https://www.dw.com/en/whats-in-store-for-eu-southeast-asia-ties-in-2024/a-67852275,POLITICS,What's in store for EU-Southeast Asia ties in 2024? 30.12.2023,"European Parliament elections will be held in early June, triggering possible changes at the top of the European Commission and the European Council.
At present, it remains unclear whether European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will run for reelection. Continuity within the EU's executive would augur continuity in its engagement with Southeast Asian countries, which has been on an upward trajectory in recent years.
However, a surge by the far right in the elections or a hung parliament, sparking post-election politicking, could disrupt the EU's foreign policy agenda, analysts have said. 

In February, some 200 million voters in Indonesia will also head to the polls to vote for a new president and parliament, and their decisions will have ramifications across the region. 
""Indonesia is regarded as primus inter pares in [Southeast Asia], thus the outcome of the presidential and parliamentary elections in the largest Muslim country in the world will be closely watched,"" said Alfred Gerstl, an expert on Indo-Pacific international relations at the University of Vienna.
""A likely positive outcome is that it can be expected the election will be free and fair, proving that democracy works in Southeast Asia,"" he added.
According to most opinion polls, the front-runner is Prabowo Subianto, the current defense minister and the purported status-quo candidate.
Subianto will put a ""stronger emphasis on strengthening Indonesia's defense capabilities but will otherwise likely follow the traditional free-and-active foreign policy credo,"" said Gerstl.
However, some reckon he will be even more assertive than Joko Widodo, the incumbent president, over the EU's deforestation and environmental regulations.
Indonesia and Malaysia — which together account for around 85% of global palm oil production — in 2021 launched cases against the EU at the World Trade Organization, while their governments decried what Jakarta called ""regulatory imperialism."" 
From December 2024, the EU rules will ban the import of numerous goods, including palm oil, timber and rubber, unless companies can prove they aren't causing deforestation, a requirement that several Southeast Asian governments have said is too burdensome on their countries' small businesses.
Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand are the world's three largest exporters of palm oil, as well as major exporters of other products that could be banned under the EU's incoming laws.
Speaking in November at a forum organized by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta, Subianto said that Indonesia doesn't ""really need Europe anymore.""
""We open our market to you, but you won't allow us to sell palm oil, and now we have problems trying to sell coffee, tea, cocoa,"" he added.

The EU will continue with free-trade agreement negotiations with Indonesia and Thailand which progressed in 2023.
Peter Stano, an EU spokesperson, said he reckons Thailand's parliament will approve the EU-Thailand Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in 2024, allowing many of the engagement mechanisms under this pact to come into force.
Some pundits also think formal EU trade talks with Malaysia and the Philippines could begin next year; the governments of both countries this year voiced their ambition to advance discussions.
Meanwhile, Malaysia and Indonesia, two Muslim-majority nations, have been vehemently opposed to Israel's ongoing military offensive in Gaza and have repeatedly called out Western countries for their apparent ""double standards"" in not supporting a cease-fire in Gaza at the same time as they have militarily aided Ukraine.   
Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after Hamas, which has been recognized as a terrorist group by the EU, the United States, Germany and other governments, carried out a series of major terror attacks in southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostages.
Tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza have since been killed in the fighting, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza.
Calming the tensions over the situation in Gaza will be high on the agenda at the EU-ASEAN Ministerial, a meeting of EU and Southeast Asian foreign ministers, in Brussels on February 2. It will be the ""highlight of the year"" for European-Southeast Asian relations, according to Stano.
""We aim to adopt a joint statement on enhancing our strategic partnership and defending multilateralism in the face of increased global instability,"" said the EU spokesperson.
Laos — a communist-run state and arguably the Southeast Asian country with the least diplomatic engagement with the EU — takes over the chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for 2024 and will host the bloc's annual events and summits for the entire year.
Because of Laos' close partnership with China, some other Southeast Asian governments are concerned Laos could use its chairmanship to advance Beijing's interests in the region, especially over the South China Sea, a maritime area in which China is engaged in increasingly hostile territorial disputes with several Southeast Asian countries.

Another unknown is Myanmar, a country that has been in political crisis since a military coup in early 2021. In the final months of 2023, a major offensive launched by several ethnic armed groups appeared to be tipping the balance against the military junta.
But those groups in December sat down for China-mediated talks with the generals — a possible sign that the most militarily competent of the ethnic organizations might not automatically side with the shadow National Unity Government and its ambitions to build a federal democracy. 
The EU has imposed several rounds of sanctions on the Myanmar junta and its affiliated businesses and increased humanitarian aid to the country this year, as well as engaging more openly with government officials.
But most analysts don't expect a sea change in EU policy, certainly not formal recognition of the National Unity Government as the legitimate government or funding for anti-junta forces.

The company later announced that Eurostar trains will resume normal services on Sunday.
""At least one tunnel can now be used,"" the company said.
 ""We're able to confirm that we'll be running our planned timetable tomorrow,"" the Eurostar posted on the platform X, formerly Twitter. ""Our stations will be extremely busy due to today's disruption.""
""Flooding in the tunnels between St Pancras international and Ebbsfleet has not improved and train services are unable to operate"", Eurostar said in a statement.
It added that Network Rail, Britain's grid operator, was keeping it updated regarding how the situation is evolving ahead of Sunday.
Thousands of passengers were stranded ahead of New Year's Eve, struggling to reach their destinations within Europe. The cancelations affected routes between major European cities including London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam.
Floods inundated the tunnels near Ebbsfleet International station in the UK's Kent, with the Met Office issuing weather warnings for rain, snow and ice across large swathes of the country.
Eurostar, which is 55.75% owned by French state-owned SNCF Voyageurs, apologized to its customers.
""Due to the flooding of a tunnel on the high-speed line near London, we're having to cancel all our trains on our route to/from London on Saturday 30 December. Our stations are very busy today. Please don’t come to the station unless you have a valid ticket to travel,"" the service provider said on its website.

The British rail service Southeastern Railway also announced national train cancelations due to flooding. Affected stations include Ebbsfleet International, Stratford International and London St Pancras International.
It said no high-speed trains were expected to run between St Pancras and Ashford International.
""We are working to fix the flooding in the tunnels,"" it said.
The Met Office said its weather alerts may remain in effect until New Year's Eve.

https://www.dw.com/en/why-gustave-eiffels-name-remains-famous-100-years-after-his-death/a-67792788,CULTURE,Why Gustave Eiffel's name remains famous 100 years after his death 29.12.2023,"Leaving behind a legacy of 700 constructions in 30 countries, visionary French engineer Gustave Eiffel died 100 years ago, on December 27, 1923 in Paris, at the age of 91.
His name is of course most directly associated with the Eiffel Tower, built for the 1889 Universal Exposition in Paris. The landmark structure has since become the symbol of the French capital and one of the world's most-visited attractions.
It is only through a quirk of history, however, that the striking tower bears the name of Gustave Eiffel, or that it is even standing today.
The engineer was initially not enthusiastic about the structure designed by Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nougier, colleagues in his construction company, Compagnie des Etablissements Eiffel.
That's why Eiffel involved his chief architect, Stephen Sauvestre, in the planning. The number of floors were reduced from six to three, while Sauvestre changed the position of the foundations and added the striking round arch under the first platform.
Eiffel, Koechlin and Nougier jointly applied for a patent on the design principle. Eventually Eiffel bought the copyrights from his employees.
The structure was subsequently named Eiffel Tower. But it could also have been called the Koechlin & Nougier Tower or the Sauvestre Tower. Who remembers them today?
Critics initially disparaged the design as a ""tragic lamppost,"" a ""disgusting ink stain,"" or the ""disgrace of Paris.""
An open letter against the project was published in the magazine Les Temps on February 14, 1887.
""We, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate lovers of the still intact beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength and indignation in the name of misunderstood French taste, in the name of art and threatened French history, against the construction of the useless and monstrous Eiffel Tower,"" the letter stated.
Among the signatories were writers such as Guy de Maupassant, Leconte de Lisle, Charles Gounod and Alexandre Dumas. 
The latter criticized the ""dizzying ridiculousness"" of the tower, which would dominate the city like a ""gigantic black factory chimney"" and overwhelm the architecture with its ""barbaric mass.""
But the idea of the tower caught on and Eiffel was able to quickly realize the construction, which consisted of 18,000 individual parts.
He even took on a large part of the financing by securing the lucrative usage rights for 20 years. People's curiosity about the monumental half-timbered tower was huge from the start.
Eiffel, who was born in Dijon on December 15, 1832, perhaps inherited his business savy from his mother, Catherine Moneuse.
The daughter of a timber merchant, she had invested in the booming hard coal business and the family's wealth grew massively within a short period of time.
In 1856, Gustave entered the service of Charles Nepveu, a civil engineering contractor and by his mid-20s the young Eiffel was already the construction manager of one the largest construction sites in France, the Bordeaux railway bridge.
Things got off to a good start for Eiffel professionally, but he was still single in his 30s, and wrote to his mother that he needed ""a neat housewife who won't pester me too much."" His mother found a match for him: 17-year-old Marie Gaudelet, whom he soon married.
The young Eiffel's constructions were in demand everywhere. He soon built churches in the Philippines and Peru, the Western Railway Station in Budapest, bridges in Vietnam and the iron framework of the Statue of Liberty in New York.
The plan was to demolish the Eiffel Tower once Gustave Eiffel's 20-year permit to use the land had expired.
However, the engineer wanted to have his masterpiece preserved for posterity. Early on, he started searching for a scientific purpose for the tower that would justify its existence.
He set up a meteorological and an astronomical observation station, while scientific experiments were carried out there also.
In 1898, the first wireless telegraph connection was established between the Eiffel Tower and the Pantheon.
By 1910, no one would have even considered demolishing the Eiffel Tower. Eiffel's rights were renewed for decades. 
During the First World War, the French army used the Eiffel Tower as a strategic observation post.
And it remained standing despite being threatened during World War II: The Nazis decided not to blow up the tower in 1944 when their defeat became apparent.
After the Second World War, all sorts of athletes — mountaineers, motocross riders, mountain bikers, bungee jumpers, parachutists and even tightrope acrobats — found a way to integrate the striking tower into their stunts.
The Eiffel Tower is still a top tourist attraction in Paris today, but is now considered a ""rusty old lady.""
The 324-meter-high (1,063-feet) and 7,300-ton iron tower was not actually intended to last forever since initial plans were to have it dismantled.
According to research from 2022 by French magazine Marianne, corrosion is causing major damage to the tower that urgently needs an overhaul.
""We saw Notre Dame burning, will we see the Eiffel Tower collapse?” asked the article's author.

https://www.dw.com/en/can-bollywood-bring-india-and-pakistan-closer-together/a-67841796,CULTURE,Can Bollywood bring India and Pakistan closer together? 28.12.2023,"Films in Pakistan need to be cleared by provincial boards that censor anything deemed a violation of the country's social and cultural values.
And, since 2019, movies produced by India's Hindi film industry, based out of the country's financial capital, Mumbai, and more popularly known as Bollywood, have not been allowed at cinemas in Pakistan.
When the blockbuster ""Pathaan"" with actor Shah Rukh Khan was publicly screened in Karachi's affluent DHA neighborhood in January 2023, the censor board in Pakistan's southern province of Sindh, where Karachi is located, stopped the screening.
Relations between Pakistan and neighboring India have seldom been cordial, particularly because of the disputed Kashmir territory.
Nevertheless, many Pakistani cinemagoers are ardent followers of Bollywood and its stars.
Apart from Shah Rukh Khan, known as the ""King of Bollywood,"" whose latest comedy-drama ""Dunki"" was released in cinemas earlier this month, other Bollywood actors such as Aamir Khan, Deepika Padukone and Ranbir Kapoor enjoy a large following in Pakistan.
In the past few years, movies produced in the southern part of India — or helmed by directors hailing from the south — have gained popularity in Pakistan because of their action-oriented and technology-driven storylines.
Adding to the appeal of Bollywood on the other side of the geographical divide is the language featured in the films, Hindi.
Hindi is similar to Urdu, which is the language widely spoken in Muslim-majority Pakistan. Also, some of the artists and technicians working in Bollywood come from Muslim backgrounds.
Despite the tensions between India and Pakistan at the state level, similar cultural aspects beween the two nations persist — particularly when it comes to movies and music.
""I heard a TV host the other day talk about the subject. He was of the view that before 1947, in undivided India, we were making similar films,"" actor Mohib Mirza told DW.
""Our heroes also sang songs in the valleys and around the trees. But I think influence is a different subject. Bollywood itself is not original — it's heavily influenced by many other countries,"" Mirza said.
""The reason that our audiences watch Indian films is the way they 'market' their stuff,"" Mirza added. ""No matter what, we will get the news about what's happening in India.""

But journalist Ghazi Salahuddin disagrees.
""Bollywood has a lot of influence in Pakistan primarily because its films are widely watched in the country for their quality and content, something that we lack,"" Salahuddin told DW.
""They have adapted to technological advancement, as well,"" he said. ""They have a big international market due to which they can afford to experiment and spend a lot of money on their screen projects. India's economic success has a role to play in it, too.""
Indian and Pakistani movies have song and dance sequences, said filmmaker Shoaib Sultan, whose directorial debut ""Gunjal"" was released in cinemas on December 15. ""It's a massive industry. Our audiences watch it because it's entertaining and larger than life."" 
Given that Pakistan lacks a major film industry of its own, movie distributors and cinema owners in the country now largely depend on releases from major Hollywood studios to keep their businesses afloat.
""Until we [in Pakistan] start making movies, people will keep watching Bollywood,"" said film distributor and exhibitor Nadeem Mandviwalla.
""These are the only two countries in the world which make movies the same way: song-and-dance sequences, dresses and the language, etc.,"" he said. ""They call it the Hindi language and we call it Urdu. They use 80% Urdu words in Hindi.""

""Peace activists on either side keep trying to bring the temperatures in the political field down,"" said Salahuddin. ""Indians and Pakistanis travel a lot and have large diasporas, because of which they meet each other outside South Asia.""  
Mandviwalla highlighted the importance of Indian movies in Pakistan.
""Our people know so much about India because of their exposure to its films,"" the film distributor said. ""For the last 40 years,"" he added, ""the Pakistani public has been watching Indian content.""
But, since Pakistan banned Indian movies in 2019, exhibitors and distributors in the country have had a tough time. 
""We [as exhibitors] tell our government that there are only two choices: either allow Indian content or make at least 100 to 150 movies a year, which will help the Pakistani film industry stand on its feet,"" Mandviwalla said.
As government leaders work to resolve the larger differences between the neighboring countries, their people can continue to focus on their cultural similarities.

It builds and lets properties, leaving the retail operations of the department stores to other businesses.
According to the company website, it owns properties worth a total of €20.4 billion ($22.7 billion). Its annual report for 2022 listed liabilities of almost €10.8 billion at the end of the previous year.
Signa Development focuses on residential and commercial urban development projects. The current balance sheet total is stated on its website as €4.6 billion.
Signa Holding, a network of some 1,000 companies, is owned by Austrian real estate and retail mogul Rene Benko.
The network has recently been beset by the higher building costs, energy prices, and interest rates that have dogged the entire property sector of late, while the brick-and-mortar retail sector is also struggling, partly against online competition.
The holding firm filed for insolvency in November this year.

https://www.dw.com/en/middle-east-2023-war-instead-of-era-of-peace/a-67827920,POLITICS,Middle East 2023: War instead of 'era of peace' 28.12.2023,"Before the October 7 attacks, one could have thought that many leaders of the Arab world had forgotten about the Palestinians.
Political calculations, above all the two-state-solution with an independent Palestinian state, seemed to be of little concern any longer.
Priorities had apparently shifted away from the Palestinians and, remarkably, toward Israel.
In 2020, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan signed normalization agreements with Israel.
Also, talks with Saudi Arabia seemed to put Israel well on the way to peace with the influential neighbor to its south. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, all of this heralded an ""era of peace.""
But then came the October 7 attacks by the militant organization Hamas, which is classified as a terrorist organization in Germany, the EU, the US and by several other governments. Hamas fighters killed around 1,200 Israeli citizens and kidnapped some 250 people. Around half have been released since, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
In turn, Israel launched airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, and a ground offensive began at the end of October. Israel has accused Hamas of installing its military infrastructure in areas inhabited or used by civilians.
The Hamas-run Health Ministry has since put the number of deaths in the Gaza Strip at more than 21,000.
Meanwhile, many Arab states have expressed their solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, for example, said the war that Israel is waging against Hamas in the Gaza Strip is a ""blatant aggression"" against Palestinian civilians and threatens to destabilize the entire Middle East. By blocking the supply of food, medicine and fuel, he said, Israel was committing ""war crimes.""
As of now, the Hamas terror attacks did at least achieve one thing: The Palestinians and their concerns have returned to regional and international agendas. The Middle East conflict, which has remained unresolved for more than 70 years, is now back in the spotlight.
""Arab states are driven by their own stability concerns,"" said Andre Bank, Middle East researcher at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies, a Hamburg-based think tank.
Israel's direct neighbors Jordan and Egypt both signed peace treaties with Israel decades ago. They now fear, however, that a further escalation in Gaza or the occupied West Bank might lead to a major displacement of Palestinians which could then lead to unrest in their own countries.
""As a result, demonstrations are allowed in Egypt, but not on Cairo's Tahrir Square, which was the center of the democracy movement in 2011,"" Bank told DW, adding that ""[Egyptian] President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi is worried that such protests could turn into demonstrations of solidarity in the spirit of the Arab Spring.""
In Jordan, pro-Palestinian protests are allowed, however, not near the border with the West Bank. ""The concern is that protests there could easily get out of control,"" said Bank.
In the Gulf states, though, there have hardly been any protests so far. This is consistent with the Emirates' positioning, Bank told DW. The UAE even sided with Israel, at least initially, he added.
The small state of Qatar — some of the Hamas leadership live in the Qatari capital, Doha — has publicly criticized Israel several times. However, in an interview with the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung at the end of November, Qatar's head of government, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, described his country's relationship with Israel as ""pragmatic.""
""We in Qatar have repeatedly said that the problems are the occupation and the Palestinian issue, there is no other problem than that,"" he said. If a solution to these issues is not found, the region would forever be trapped in a cycle of violence, Al Thani added. ""Otherwise, why should we have a problem with Israel if this is seriously addressed?""
But experts doubt the rapprochement between Israel and the Arab world will remain deadlocked.
Johannes Becke, professor of Israel and Middle East Studies at the Heidelberg University of Jewish Studies, told DW that ""harsh rhetoric was expressed at the summit of Arab-Muslim states in Riyadh at the beginning of November, but it also stopped right there.""
The main reasons for this, he said, are the economic and geostrategic interests of Arab states with regard to Israel that remain largely untouched by the conflict in Gaza.
Israel is generally regarded as highly attractive partner for business and technology. Rapprochement with Israel also brings advantages in relations with the United States and other Western countries, he said.
Furthermore, Israel is an important geostrategic partner for those countries that — like the Gulf states — also want to see Iran's influence in the region limited.
""Saudi Arabia improved its relations with Iran in 2023,"" said Becke. However, the rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Israel, which until the Hamas attacks appeared to be rapid, seems to be on hold for the time being due to the war in Gaza.
However, when Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen started firing missiles toward Israel in early December to support Hamas in its fight against Israel, Saudi Arabia took action and intercepted the missiles.
""Until recently, these missiles were fired towards Saudi Arabia itself and may also be aimed at the kingdom again,"" said Becke. ""In this sense, the geopolitical arguments in favor of an Arab-Israeli rapprochement remain unchanged, rather on the contrary, the Hamas attack may even have strengthened them.""
Still, the ongoing pro-Palestinian rallies in the Arab and Islamic world demonstrate the mobilization potential of the war. This is precisely why Arab governments are likely to be interested in ending it as quickly and as permanently as possible, before the protests jeopardize their own stability.
However, rapprochement with Israel may only be resumed after the war, and once the Palestinians benefit from of a new version of the two-state solution. In the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung interview, Qatar's head of government Al-Thani already outlined the framework for this: ""The Palestinian issue can no longer be swept under the carpet,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/uk-celebrates-brexit-dividend-with-pint-sized-wine-bottles/a-67832639,BUSINESS,UK celebrates Brexit dividend with pint-sized wine bottles 27.12.2023,"""'Pint’ size wine stocked on Britain’s shelves for the first time ever thanks to new freedoms from leaving the European Union,"" Britain's Department of Business and Trade exclaimed in a Wednesday press release.
In the UK, an imperial pint measures 568 milliliters.
In less enthusiastic tones, government officials also announced that a mooted, much broader revival of imperial weights and measurements was being axed — after more than 98% of the public told a government consultation that they did not want it.
New ""pint""-sized bottles were made possible by the UK's vote for Brexit in 2016, and subsequent legislation passed this year which revoked a series of laws that were a legacy of Britain's membership in the EU, the ministry said. These included laws on standardized weights and measures and labeling.
""Our exit from the EU was all about moments just like this, where we can seize new opportunities and provide a real boost to our great British wineries and further growing the economy,"" Minister for Enterprise, Markets and Small Business Kevin Hollinrake was quoted as saying.
Introducing the new 568ml bottle size, to go alongside the standard 750 milliliter measure and an expanded range of 200ml and 500ml bottles being permitted to go on sale, is ""wholeheartedly backed by industry wanting to reduce burdensome regulations,"" the ministry claimed in its statement.
It argued it would ""help to boost innovation, increase business freedoms and improve choice for consumers."" 
Supermarkets, pubs, restaurants and clubs would all be able to sell the new variant, the government said, with the new rules coming into effect at the new year. 
It said 900 UK vineyards would be able to make use of the scheme, although participation remains voluntary.

The standard 750ml (roughly 1.6 US pints, or 1.3 imperial British pints, or roughly 2 Indian pints, if you were wondering!) wine bottle size is standard in most of the world — including some noteworthy remaining bastions of imperial measurements like the US and the UK itself. This is based primarily on constraints on how large glass bottles can be blown practically and with ease at scale. It also equates to about six small wine glasses, or four larger ones.
In the UK, the pint had at times become a symbol of British patriotism amid the Brexit debate. The EU membership did not affect the beer measures of a 568ml pint and half pint in the country, despite occasional claims to the contrary. It did, however, prompt UK officials to move away from using the traditional crown symbol to vouch for the glasses' size — but the crown symbol could still be displayed additionally.
As the British government loudly toasted its new fermented freedoms, it also announced it was abandoning plans for a much more widespread return of the imperial weights and measurements system. 
The government had launched a public consultation of consumers, asking if they would like to change from kilos and liters when buying most produce, after the UK more or less converted to the metric system over several decades starting in the 1960s.
""Following the extensive consultation, the Government has decided not to introduce any new legislation in this area. But new guidance has been issued to promote awareness and use of imperial measurements,"" the statement said. 
According to the government's figures on its public consultation, more than 100,000 people participated.
Of them, 81.1% favored the primarily-metric status quo, 17.6% called for a switch to universal metrification, 0.9% called for more choice and 0.4% wanted imperial measurements only. 
""A key theme that emerged from respondents who were opposed to change to the current units of measuring system was concern that increased choice over units of measurements could present increased costs to businesses and present barriers to international trade,"" the statement conceded.

https://www.dw.com/en/how-the-afghan-exodus-is-spoiling-pakistans-environment/a-67826441,NATURE AND ENVIRONMENT,How the Afghan exodus is spoiling Pakistan's environment 27.12.2023,"Forty-eight-year old Raja Mohammed Akhtar Khan's booming recycling business came to a halt a few weeks ago.
He was making 1 million Pakistani rupees (€3,200/$3,540) monthly, but the exodus of Afghan refugees from the South Asian country in recent weeks — many of whom were involved in trash and scrap collection — has dealt a severe blow to his business.
Hailing from Lahore in eastern Pakistan, Khan has been in the recycling business for over 22 years.
He said Afghan refugees living in the country were some of the most hardworking people. Many of them also started several businesses in his city.

""Afghan refugees in my area would collect around 200 kilograms of plastic daily and deliver it to my shop,"" Khan told DW, saying that they would charge much less than their Pakistani counterparts for their work.
""Now I am only able to receive 35 kilograms of plastic daily, which has badly affected my business — causing me a loss of almost 700,000 rupees a month,"" Khan said. ""It is not only me who suffered, around 200 shops in my region are in the same situation.""
Since mid-September 2023, Pakistani authorities have deported around 20,000 Afghans to their war-ravaged home country. Threats, detentions and deportations have forced out another 355,000 Afghans, according to Human Rights Watch.
The development is now taking a toll on large-scale plastic recycling industries, which rely heavily on Afghan workers.
Pakistan generates approximately 49.6 million tons of solid waste a year, and this is increasing at a rate of over 2.4% annually, according to figures from the US Department of Commerce. About 9% of this consists of plastic.
According to the World Wildlife Fund, around 250 million tons of existing garbage in Pakistan primarily consists of plastic bags, PET bottles and food scraps. Some of this is being recycled by 19 recycling plants across the country.
Waleed Hameed, director of corporate social responsibility at Five Star Polymer Private Limited, a recycling factory in Lahore, told DW that several recycling plants were dependent on Afghan laborers.
Ever since the government's decision to deport Afghan refugees, he said, plastic collection has been down by 43% and production of polyester by 50%.
Labor costs have also gone up, making it difficult for the recycling industry to survive.
""If the same situation continues, then the industry is likely to suffer huge financial losses,"" Hameed said.
Thousands of people arrived at the Torkham border crossing in north-western Pakistan, after Pakistan announced that it had begun taking undocumented Afghans to camps for deportation. With around 4 million Afghans, Pakistan is home to the majority of the Afghan diaspora. According to government figures, 1.7 million of them are in the country illegally.







Nasir Khan, a scrap dealer from the southern port city of Karachi, said the collection of plastic and other materials has drastically come down. Collecting plastic and scrap was the ""total domain of Afghan refugees"" who would work for 16 to 18 hours collecting trash and sorting it out, Khan told DW.
An inspector from the Capital Development Authority in Islamabad, who asked not to be named, said recycling rubbish in Pakistan has become extremely difficult since the deportations of Afghan refugees began. ""With limited human resources it is not possible for us to carry out such sorting at all,"" said the inspector. 
Environmentalists have warned that Pakistan's weakening recycling industry could further aggravate environmental degradation.
According to the United Nations Development Program, Pakistan has one of the highest percentages of mismanaged plastic in South Asia. More than 3.3 million tons of plastic is wasted each year in Pakistan, with most of it ending up in landfills, unmanaged dumps or strewn about land and bodies of water across the country.
Afia Salam, an environmentalist, told DW that plastics recycling has just started gaining traction with businesses, but that the deportation of Afghan refugees is casting a negative shadow over the industry.
The immediate results have been visible, with falling production and the dwindling supply of plastic bottles, she said, adding that it is likely to continue for some time before the vacuum can be filled by Pakistani laborers.

But Muhammad Saad Saleem, an Islamabad-based sustainable development expert, believes it will be very difficult for Pakistani laborers to fill this vacuum.
""This is an extremely labor intensive job, which Pakistani laborers, especially in Punjab, won't be [willing] to do,"" Saleem said, adding this is likely to cause severe labor shortages in the coming months.
Hameed said his company, which prepares 32 products from PET bottles, recycled more than 18,000 metric tons of bottles last year.
""But I am not sure if we will be able to recycle the same amount next year after the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Afghan workers,"" he said.
Saleem also noted that they produce around 170,000 bottles annually for the beverages industry. ""Collecting them and other plastic waste on time without Afghan refugees would be an uphill task.""

https://www.dw.com/en/sports-psychology-in-german-football-making-progress/a-67831510,SOCCER,Sports psychology in German football making progress 27.12.2023,"Regardless of who is winning, losing or playing, the major narratives in German football are often attributed to Kopfsache – literally translated as a ""mind matter.""
About 5% of athletes in elite sports suffer from depression, roughly in line with the general population. German football is already extremely aware of mental illnesses like depression after the tragic death of Robert Enke in 2009, so how is the current sports psychology system in Germany faring?
In September, Rene Paasch, one of Germany's most prominent sports psychologists, suggested the role was in need of a ""paradigm shift"" because ""outdated thought patterns and approaches"" had left little room for innovation. Many others in the field however, have said otherwise.
Johanna Belz, a sports psychologist at Germany's most famous sports university in Cologne, has spoken positively of her time working at Cologne's football academy, commenting on the club's comprehensive approach to sports psychology.
""My experiences were with very open academies that do a lot more than the minimum,"" Belz told DW. ""But, of course, in academies where one sport psychologist is in charge of 10 teams, that's just not possible. Some need to take a look at themselves in the mirror, but we also need to celebrate those academies that go above and beyond.""

There are others who feel the perspective expressed by Paasch does not reflect the current reality.
""Another problem for sports psychology in German football at the moment is that there is still a stereotypical, conservative image of psychological work in a high-performance context,"" Christoph Herr, the coordinator of psychology at the German soccer federation (DFB), told DW.
""That's why it's very important how we publicize our trustworthy work. It's not always about us being louder, it's about listening more closely to our experienced colleagues who are established in football.
""And I would sometimes like to see fewer sweeping statements and more collegial, ethical behaviour. Then the image of sports psychology wouldn't be so distorted.""

Another thing often forgotten is that it's only been five years since the DFB made sports psychologists compulsory at academies — and that time included a global pandemic. With that in mind, progress has been solid, with Herr saying he increasingly hears academy bosses talking about sports psychology with an extensive concept behind their words.
Naturally, some old-fashioned approaches remain, but Herr believes one of the best things sports psychology in German football can do now is to become more involved with the decision-makers in the game.
""We don't have the only correct truth, but rather want to enter into dialogue with coaches and decision-makers [through training and further education]. The involvement of sports psychologists and psychological expertise within the football system is fundamental to the healthy development of young people. Raising awareness of this should be promoted during the ongoing development of sports psychology. Some clubs are supplementing this topic with additional modern coach developers.""
The field has long evolved beyond the firefighter role it's often reduced to, but German academies are not yet ready to meet that demand, often because of cost or a lack of knowledge.
Timo Heinze is one of two academy sports psychologists at Leverkusen and has worked with some of the best young players in Germany. For Heinze, a former player himself, the change has not been rapid, but it is happening.
""Compared to many professional fields in football, we are still in the relatively early stages,"" Heinze told DW. ""However, the quantity and quality of sports psychology is growing from season to season, and I am convinced that this trend will continue in the future. The need is there and is also recognized by clubs and managers. Compared to other areas of a player's football performance such as technique, tactics or athleticism, mental skills certainly offer the greatest potential for development.
""In the end, it's about the players. It's about creating a space in which their mental health is protected in the best possible way despite the tough business of football. It's about bringing them closer to individual solutions in different areas of life in the sense of holistic personal development. And, of course, to show them ways in which they can improve their performance through mental strategies.""
Employing more sports psychologists is absolutely necessary, particularly in women's youth football given, as Johanna Belz highlighted, more psychological provision was required there. But changes to the environment are also necessary to improve psychological safety.
""Why does a person often have to deal with hundreds of problems when they could actually focus on the essential issues by improving the environment?"" Herr asked.
Another suggested improvement has been educational reforms, although Belz felt she got a lot of opportunities to learn more than just the theory through the 100 contact hours required to complete the course. She did, however, notice a deficit in her abilities at the end of the qualification and so completed a course with the goal of learning conversation techniques so as to feel more capable in the job.
But the German soccer federation appears to have recognized some of these gaps, firstly by offering a specific six-month course to sports psychologists working in football in recognition of the unique demands of the sport. And secondly, by introducing six regional hubs so that sports psychologists from different academies can meet and exchange ideas.
Sports psychology in German football has made strides in the short time it has been compulsory, but like any constantly evolving field it's greatest challenge now is to keep up. If it can, there is every reason to believe a more multidimensional, holistic approach is possible.

https://www.dw.com/en/how-is-climate-change-affecting-europes-ski-season/a-67757334,TRAVEL,How is climate change affecting Europe's ski season? 27.12.2023,"Anton Bodner was relieved when it snowed heavily in Kitzbühel, Austria, just in time for the start of the ski season.
""This has taken a lot of pressure off,"" said the CEO of Bergbahn AG Kitzbühel, which operates 57 lifts around the small Austrian ski resort town. When there's snow, the lifts transport about 1.5 million tourists each winter.
""This year, nature gifted us this good start to the season,"" said Bodner. ""One which we haven't had for a long time.""
Despite the strong start of the ski season in Kitzbühel, the consequences of climate change are clear to see in the Alps. Rising temperatures are causing glaciers to melt, and that means less snow, making ski tourism an increasingly unpredictable business. In Kitzbühel, for example, during the famous Hahnenkamm ski race in January 2023, skiers raced down the legendary challenging ski run known as the ""Streif"" on artificial snow. Brown meadows flanked the snowy strip.
""Of course we are aware of climate developments,"" said Bodner. ""It would be crazy not to be."" He assumes that the snow line, the level on a mountain above which snow is found for most of the year, will recede by about 200 meters (660 feet) by 2050. But, thanks to the possibility of making artificial snow, ""there will still be skiing in Kitzbühel in decades to come,"" he said. Bodner doesn't believe that ski tourism will vanish in the area. 
Robert Steiger, an associate professor in the public finance department at the University of Innsbruck, has been studying the effects of climate change on the industry for years. He is currently working on the basis of the most pessimistic climate scenario, according to which 80% of ski resorts in the Austrian Alps will still have enough snow in 2050 — although it won't be all natural snow. He believes there will be an increase in water use of up to 100% to account for artificial snowmaking.
""Some ski resorts will still be operational at the end of the century,"" he said. ""For others, however, it will already be difficult in 20 years.""
First and foremost, operators need to be aware of climate-related risks. The specific impact of climate change varies from case to case, and it's not possible to make blanket statements about what can be done to mitigate change.
""However, it has to be said that most destinations are primarily concerned with how they can safeguard their snow-related tourist business,"" said Steiger. 
The vast majority of companies in the industry are focusing on winter sports enthusiasts and providing enough artificial snow to keep them coming, said Werner Bätzing, a professor emeritus of cultural geography at the Friedrich-Alexander University in Erlangen-Nuremberg.
That's because winter sports enthusiasts bring in significantly more money than other vacationers, he said. Plus, as the market shrinks, competition increases. ""This has led to merciless cut-throat competition,"" said Bätzing.
Many Alpine destinations continue to rely on ski tourism, as the demand for winter breaks remains high and a lack of snowfall can still be offset through artificial snowmaking.
But there have also been calls for change. The aim of the EU-funded Beyond Snow project is to encourage a rethink in the industry. ""For many cable car companies, climate change is still a taboo subject,"" said Giovanni Vassena of Alpine Pearls, an organization that represents various regional destinations that focus on sustainable tourism.
The municipality of Werfenweng, near Salzburg, offers alpaca hikes, toboggan runs and horse-drawn carriage rides — alongside stellar ski slopes.
Other regions have accepted that they are increasingly dependent on artificial snow. Every January, Ruhpolding in the southern German state of Bavaria hosts the Biathlon World Cup. Gregor Matjan, head of the city's tourism board, said officials were well aware of the possibility that each year might bring less snowfall. Their solution is to rely on artificial snow to prepare cross-country ski trails used by tourists.
""I assume that this will continue to be the case for at least the next decade,"" said Matjan. Other regions are creating ski trails made of plastic mats, which could make cross-country skiing a year-round activity.

""We are thinking very hard about how our tourism model needs to change,"" said Bodner, of the Kitzbühel cable car company. The resort town is considering creating tourism offerings outside of the winter season, which could include mountain tours on electric bikes, among other activities.
At the moment, however, Bodner and others are simply hoping for colder temperatures and fresh snowfall.

Luis Antonio da Silva Braga, better known as ""Zinho,"" had been on the run since 2018 and is the subject of at least a dozen outstanding warrants, according to a police statement issued late Sunday.
""Zinho"" had been designated the state of Rio de Janeiro's ""public enemy Number 1."" He is now in custody awaiting trial, according to a police statement.
""After the formalities due to his arrest, the inmate was taken for medical forensics and then sent to the state's prison system, where he will remain available for our courts,"" the statement read.
On Monday, Brazilian Justice Minister Flavio Dino hailed the arrest on X, formally known as Twitter, saying it was an ""important result"" following ""serious and planned work being carried out in Rio de Janeiro and other states, in the fight against criminal factions.""
Militia groups came to prominence in the South American country around four decades ago, rising up from the ranks of former police officers, soldiers, firefighters and prison guards. Initially, they were formed as community self-defense units against the threat posed by drug gangs in the city known for its violent crime.
But the militias then went on to seek ""protection"" money from businesses and took control of service provision to inhabitants of Rio's impoverished  favela neighborhoods. They have in recent years expanded into drug trafficking, as well as money laundering.
The militias are said to control around 10% of Rio's metropolitan area, according to a study last year by the non-profit Fogo Cruzado and a security-focused research group at the Fluminense Federal University.

https://www.dw.com/en/china-sub-zero-beijing-breaks-december-cold-weather-record/a-67817116,CLIMATE,China: Sub-zero Beijing breaks December cold weather record 25.12.2023,"China's capital has broken its record for the number of hours with temperatures below freezing point in December, after a cold wave hit much of the country with blizzards and prolonged low temperatures. 
Northern and northeastern China experienced particularly cold temperatures over the last roughly two weeks, caused by biting cold air blowing south from the Arctic, with some areas hitting lows of negative 40 degrees Celsius (minus 40 Fahrenheit).
As of Sunday, a Beijing weather observatory had recorded more than 300 hours of sub-zero temperatures since December 11, the most for the month since records began in 1951, according to the state-backed Beijing Daily newspaper.
That included nine consecutive days in the capital — with its more than 20 million residents — with lows below minus 10 degrees Celsius, the paper said. 
China's National Meteorological Center has recorded record-low December temperatures at some 78 weather stations across the country, also saying average temperatures in northern and some central parts of the country were the coldest seen since 1961. 
To the southwest of Beijing in the province of Henan, several cities were left struggling to meet heating demands. 
Heating boilers at one of the major suppliers in the city of Jiaozuo broke down, leaving some areas in urgent need of more supply, state media reported on Sunday. 
The JiaoZuo WanFang Aluminium Manufacturing Company was said to be scrambling to fix the malfunction and anticipated a return to normal service by December 26. The report did not specify how many boilers had broken down.
Most businesses, except essential service providers and care homes for the elderly, had heating services suspended to prioritize residential supply. But the state media reports said some residential compounds would nevertheless face shortages during the repair period.
Two other cities in Henan — Puyang and Pingdingshan — suspended heat supply to government departments and administrative institutions to prioritize domestic supply, the local governments said. 
The strain on heating infrastructure was also visible during the week in Beijing itself, with large steam leaks emanating from cracked underground pipes.
Road and school closures and other snow-related contingencies have been commonplace in Beijing and several other cities during the month.
The freezing temperatures also provided additional hardships for survivors of last week's earthquake, albeit far to the west in Gansu and Qinghai provinces. The death toll from the magnitude 6.2 quake had risen to 149, state broadcaster CCTV reported on Monday. Tens of thousands were left in need of temporary housing units in freezing temperatures after their own homes sustained damage. 

Warmer air began to flow north to south across the country over the weekend with temperatures starting to creep back up in many parts of central and eastern China. 
Temperatures rebounded in some parts of the country by more than 10 degrees Celsius on Sunday according to China's weather authority.
In Beijing's case on Monday, December 25, high temperatures of 3 degrees Celsius (roughly 37 Fahrenheit) were expected during the day, albeit with lows of minus 7 Celsius overnight. Current forecasts for the week ahead put the daytime high temperatures in the capital consistently somewhat higher than freezing point but with similar sub-zero overnight lows.

https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-war-whats-the-impact-of-cyber-guerrillas/a-67775539,POLITICS,Ukraine war: What's the impact of cyber guerrillas? 23.12.2023,"Hackers shut down internet connections in Russian-occupied parts of eastern Ukraine in late October. In some areas, it took Russian telecom providers days to restore connectivity.
Soon after, the IT Army of Ukraine took credit for the cyberattack. The hacker group is the most prominent example of several volunteer ""hackivist"" groups that have mobilized to support Ukraine in cyberspace.
The covert nature of their operations, many of which are illegal, makes it impossible to fully assess the scope of such groups. But cybersecurity researchers agree that their activities have impacted the war since Russia began its full-scale invasion in February 2022.
""The aim is to discredit the Russian state, to show that it can't protect the services of Russian businesses,"" said Stefan Soesanto, the head of the cyberdefense project at the Center for Security Studies at ETH Zürich, a Swiss university. ""In that sense, they have a real impact, in particular on the psyche of people in Russia.""
He added that throughout the war, the activities of groups like the IT Army have become more sophisticated, shifting their focus to fewer but more targeted operations.

Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation, which coordinates the efforts of the IT Army through a website and a Telegram group, confirmed that ""in 2023, the IT Army shifted its strategy to target fewer entities but maximize impact, focusing on major players in the finance and infrastructure sectors and indirectly affecting military components.""
This year, with around 130 attacks that have been made public, the group has disrupted the operations of more than 400 pro-Russian targets, a spokesperson told DW in an email.
""There is also a similar number of operations that IT Army hasn't disclosed for various reasons,"" she wrote.
On February 26, 2022, two days after Russian tanks began rolling into Ukraine, Ukraine's Minister of Digital Transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, called on volunteers around the world to launch cyberattacks on pro-Russian targets.
It was considered the first time a country under attack had openly issued such a call – and it was answered by thousands of cyber guerrillas worldwide.
The early days of the IT Army were characterized by fairly crude and uncoordinated operations. Since then, the group has evolved into an organized entity with close ties to the Ukrainian government, according to researcher Soesanto.
Its attacks have both inflicted significant economic damage on Russian businesses and sown chaos among the Russian public, Soesanto told DW.
In May 2022, for example, an attack claimed by the IT Army shut down Russia's Chestny Znak supply chain monitoring system which tracks and traces products in the Russian market to guarantee the authenticity and quality of the goods sold in Russia.
In February 2023, the group claimed responsibility for bringing down Russian state media websites during a parliamentary address by President Vladimir Putin.
With such operations, the IT Army has emerged as the most influential pro-Ukrainian actor in the ongoing cyber-guerrilla war.
But it's not the only one: Other hacking groups, some of them interconnected, have also launched cyberattacks against pro-Russian targets.
In October, a group called the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance said it had shut down a website run by a ransomware group with links to Russia. That same month, two other pro-Ukrainian collectives claimed to have broken into the systems of Russia's largest private bank, Alfa-Bank, and obtained internal documents.
Recently, another Ukrainian volunteer hacker group told US radio station NPR that it had organized an online contest focused on gathering open-source information about Russian officials that it would share with partners in Ukraine's government.
Such links between hackers and the Ukrainian government have drawn criticism for bluring the lines between state and non-state actors in cyber warfare.
Without specifically mentioning Ukraine, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has called the increasing involvement of civilian hackers in military conflicts a ""worrying trend,"" warning that it could undermine the distinction between combatants and civilians during war.
The organization also warned that the unprecedented phenomenon could lead to a spiral of escalation. ""The more civilians take part in military operations, … the greater the risk of civilians and civilian infrastructure being targeted,"" Veronique Christory, the ICRC's senior arms adviser, said in mid-December.
To resolve legal ambiguity over its IT Army, Ukraine is reportedly preparing legislation to integrate members into the reserve section of the armed forces. The spokesperson for Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation declined to comment on the progress of these initiatives.
At the same time, Stas Yurasov, CEO of the Ukrainian technology publication dev.ua, warned that the efforts of pro-Ukrainian online guerrillas, however well intentioned, would not be enough to protect the country from Russia's efforts to weaken Ukraine through cyberattacks.
""Volunteers are just that, volunteers,"" Yurasov told DW. ""Imagine our army fighting the ground war with only volunteers.""
A recent large-scale attack on Ukraine's largest mobile operator, Kyivstar, which damaged IT infrastructure and disrupted services across the country, showed that Ukraine had done too little to strengthen its official cyber capabilities and protect the country's critical digital infrastructure, he said.
Nearly two years into Russia's full-scale invasion, many details cyber volunteers' activities remain unclear.
What is becoming increasingly clear, however, is that ""we have entered an era where hacking is becoming a core part of military conflicts,"" said cybercrime and IT law expert Vasileios Karagiannopoulos from the UK's University of Portsmouth.
He is convinced that the phenomenon of hackers taking sides in military conflicts is here to stay.
In the coming years, ""the engagement of those non-military actors is going to become much more prominent,"" Karagiannopoulos told DW.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-investors-seek-compensation-over-wirecard-fiasco/a-67808235,CRIME,Germany: Investors seek compensation over Wirecard fiasco 23.12.2023,"Ernst and Young, an international consultancy and advisory firm which goes by the initials EY, faced a damages claim on Friday in relation to their approval of the annual accounts of the collapsed Wirecard payment service provider.
The German shareholders' association DSW, which acts in the interests of shareholders, said the legal action had been lodged at the Munich district court on Friday.
Institutional and private investors are claiming compensation of more than €700 million ($772 million) from Ernst and Young.
The costs for the case are being put up by British litigators, who will receive a share of the proceeds if the action is successful.
The DSW class action lawsuit before the Bavarian regional court aims to clear up the main issues and provide the basis for further legal action.
The respondents include former Wirecard managers and EY, which approved the Wirecard accounts over several years.

Wirecard, which was listed on Germany's leading DAX index, collapsed in the summer of 2020 after about €1.9 billion allegedly held in Southeast Asian escrow accounts could not be traced.
Many of Wirecard's key executives have been on trial facing accusations of fraud, including its former chief executive, Markus Braun, who has been on trial in Munich for fraud, for the past year.
Only last week, Wirecard's former chief financial officer (CFO), Burkhard Ley, faced charges of commercial and gang fraud, market manipulation, misrepresentation and breach of trust.
As CFO, and later as an adviser to the board, Ley, together with Braun and other top managers, is accused by prosecutors of manipulating sales by helping to fabricate the alleged multibillion-dollar business with third-party customers in Asia.
They said the incorrect figures were intended to drive up the price of Wirecard shares, while the manipulated annual financial statements served to raise money from banks.
In total, the damages amounted to several hundred million euros.
Ley's lawyers rejected the accusations as unfounded and said he had left the company before the main events of the scandal unfolded.

https://www.dw.com/en/china-top-electric-automaker-byd-to-build-plant-in-hungary/a-67803705,BUSINESS,China: Top electric automaker BYD to build plant in Hungary 22.12.2023,"China's top electric carmaker BYD announced on Friday it plans to build a car factory in Hungary, in a bid to expand into Europe despite an investigation into Chinese subsidies in the tech field.
BYD Europe announced plans to build a factory in the southern Hungarian city of Szeged. It said the move would mark ""a significant step toward green mobility in Europe.""
""This state-of-the-art facility showcases BYD's commitment to sustainable development and local economies,"" it said.
Hungary celebrated the news. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said it would bring to the country ""thousands of new jobs and the latest technology in the industry of the future.""
The planned factory would be the first major consumer EV production facility for a Chinese carmaker in Europe.
BYD said it hopes by setting up the new plant to ""accelerate the entry of new energy passenger vehicles into the European market, further deepen [the firm's] global layout, and actively promote the green transformation of the global energy structure.""
It is also expected to create thousands of jobs in Hungary.
The project ""will be one of the largest investments in Hungarian economic history,"" Foreign Minister Szijjarto said, adding that the government would provide financial incentives to BYD for building the plant.
The factory's construction will ""further strengthen the position of the Hungarian economy, further strengthen the foundations of long-term economic growth, and further strengthen Hungary's position in the global electric automotive transition,"" he added.
Hungary is trying to position itself as a global hub for EV production.

BYD declared itself ""the world's leading manufacturer of new energy vehicles and power batteries,"" after becoming the first global manufacturer to pass the 5 million milestone in electric vehicle (EV) production earlier this year. Last year, it also became the first carmaker to announce that it had halted pure petrol or diesel engine car production entirely.
It had a global market share of around 18% of all electric or hybrid vehicles sold in 2022, according to a study by the EV Volumes database, compared to just 13% for US giant Tesla. However, Tesla still sells more all-electric vehicles with no hybrid component. And BYD is still almost completely dependent on its massive domestic market, with foreign sales accounting only for around 10% of its total.
China's budding electric car sector has faced growing scrutiny from the EU, which announced an investigation into Beijing subsidies which the firms have benefited from for decades. The European bloc argues that these subsidies present a risk of unfair competition.
Though an EU member, Hungary offers Asian businesses lucrative tax breaks, infrastructure and job creation subsidies as part of its ""look East"" policy.

https://www.dw.com/en/bethlehem-gaza-war-mars-christmas-festivities/a-67789339,RELIGION,Bethlehem: Gaza war mars Christmas festivities 22.12.2023,"The anticipation of Christmas has always been the best thing, Nuha Tarazi said, placing a bowl of Christmas cookies on the kitchen table. But this year is very different: There are no Christmas decorations in her home.
""We always looked forward to the holidays every year,"" Tarazi, a retired English teacher, told DW. She has not received a permit from the Israeli authorities to visit her relatives in her hometown in Gaza City for six years.
""Who wants to think about Christmas celebrations now with what is happening in Gaza?"" Tarazi said.
At Christmas, her relatives from Gaza City were usually allowed to visit her in the occupied West Bank. Tarazi was born in Gaza, but has lived in Beit Sahour, a town neighboring Bethlehem, for many decades. Many people here have relatives and friends in the Gaza Strip, where there is still a small Christian community.
For festivals such as Christmas or Easter, Israeli authorities usually issued the coveted exit permits to Palestinian Christians in the sealed-off Gaza Strip, which has been ruled for the past 17 years by the militant Hamas group.
However, it was always uncertain whether such a permit would be granted, and often not all members of a family were allowed to leave. In some years, the number of exit permits was severely limited depending on the political situation. But at least there was hope of seeing each other over the festive period and spending time together.
Now, though, everything is different again. Israel's Erez border crossing has been closed since the Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7 in southern Israel and the subsequent war. This means the route to the occupied West Bank and to Jerusalem is also closed.
But Tarazi is also in mourning: Her sister was killed in an Israeli attack on a building on the grounds of the Greek Orthodox Porphyrius Church in Gaza City in October. According to a statement from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, 18 people died in the attack, many of whom had sought shelter on the premises.
""I am alone here, and I don't know how to deal with it. My thoughts only revolve around what's happening there in Gaza,"" said Tarazi, struggling to keep her composure. She added that she wasn't even able to attend her sister's funeral.
The constant worry about other siblings and relatives keeps her busy day and night, as communication is difficult as well. ""The only thing that helps is to go into my garden and see my flowers, and take care of it,"" she said.
Tarazi isn't the only one who doesn't feel like celebrating Christmas this year. In Bethlehem, the supposed birthplace of Jesus, there will be no Christmas festivities.
Manger Square in front of the Church of the Nativity, usually packed with thousands of local and foreign visitors during the Christmas season, is empty. The city hasn't put up the large Christmas tree or the Nativity scene, and Christmas decorations and lights are nowhere to be found.
""There is no atmosphere of the feast, there are no festivities because of what is happening in Palestine, in Gaza,"" said Basel, who sells grilled chicken on Star Street, a historic street leading to Manger Square.

""Normally there would be lots of people from all over the world, from different religions, but there is no Christmas atmosphere at all,"" said Yara Alama, who lives in Bethlehem. ""You get the feeling that you can't feel any joy because of the war and what's happening to the people in Gaza.""
The Church of the Nativity, built over the site where Jesus is believed to have been born, is also unusually empty and silent. There are no long queues of people waiting to visit the narrow grotto below, where a silver star marks the sacred spot.
Father Issa Taljieh, who was born in Bethlehem, has been the church's parish priest for the Greek Orthodox community for the past 12 years. In all his time there, he said, he has never experienced such a sad Christmas season.
""People are grieving and sad about what is happening in Gaza,"" he said. ""This is the first time that the Nativity Church, the place where Jesus was born, I see it empty like this. Even during COVID-19 there were still local people that came and celebrated Christmas with us.""
During the pandemic, foreign visitors were not able to come to Bethlehem, and the tourism industry that the city depends on suffered as a result. Since October 7, access to the city, which is already cut off from Jerusalem by the Israeli separation barrier, has become even more difficult. The Israeli army has set up barriers on many access roads, which people have to cross on foot, and cars are only allowed to drive during certain hours.
In Gaza, as of December 21, more than 20,000 Palestinians had been killed, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.
According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), at least 491 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, making 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank since OCHA began recording casualties in 2005. In Israel, over 1,100 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed on October 7. Over 120 hostages are still believed to be held captive in Gaza.
Taljieh, whose first name means ""Jesus"" in Arabic, is trying to help his congregation through these difficult times.
""We can't celebrate in Bethlehem while people are killed there in Gaza, while their homes are destroyed, they become homeless, without food, without a safe place and in the middle of winter. We must include them in our prayers and pray for peace and security,"" he said.
While festivities in the city are canceled, the Christmas liturgies at the Church of the Nativity will still go ahead. On December 24, the Latin Patriarch from Jerusalem will make his entrance to Bethlehem, but this year without the accompanying music of the Palestinian scout groups. The traditional midnight Mass will also take place. About two weeks later, the Orthodox communities will celebrate their Christmas festivities, according to their calendars.
With the ongoing suffering and the hopeless situation in the Gaza Strip, it's important to draw strength from faith, said Father Rami Askarieh, parish priest of the Latin parish of St. Catherine Church in Bethlehem.
""We need Christmas now. Yes, it will be a celebration without music, without the scouts, without festivities,"" he said. ""But it is important that we keep the religious rituals, that there is a message of peace from this city to the world, a message of peace that emanates from Jesus' birthplace.""

https://www.dw.com/en/us-mexico-border-top-delegation-set-for-talks-on-migration/a-67796065,POLITICS,US-Mexico border: Top delegation set for talks on migration 22.12.2023,"US President Joe Biden and Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador have discussed ongoing ""efforts to manage migratory flows"" at the border between their countries.
During the phone call Thursday, both agreed that urgent action is needed.
The White House said a high-ranking US delegation would visit Mexico soon to discuss how immigration rules can be enforced at the border.
The visit by the top US officials to Mexico comes after Washington closed two rail crossings on the Mexico-Texas border this week to limit illegal entries on freight trains.
Business owners in Mexico have warned that the closures are affecting trade. The Mexican Employers' Association described the move as a ""failure of migration policy.""

Both Biden and Lopez Obrador on Thursday agreed that more enforcement is needed at the border so that the crossings can be reopened, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and US Homeland Security adviser Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall are among the US delegation expected to visit Mexico in the week after Christmas.
The US delegation will meet Lopez Obrador and his team in Mexico to discuss how to address the issue of illegal immigration and border enforcement.
""Their visit will really be about getting at the migratory flows and talking to President Lopez Obrador and his team about what more we can do together,"" Kirby said at a White House briefing.
Meanwhile, Republicans have continued to press Biden's Democrats to introduce major changes to the immigration policy in exchange for approving a package of emergency assistance for Ukraine and Israel.

https://www.dw.com/en/christmas-trees-part-of-german-leitkultur-says-cdus-merz/a-67794012,SOCIETY,Christmas trees part of German 'Leitkultur' says CDU's Merz 21.12.2023,"Friedrich Merz, leader of Germany's conservative opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Thursday returned to the contentious topic of defining the country's ""Leitkultur"" — which could be translated as ""guiding"" or ""leading"" or ""mainstream"" or even ""dominant"" culture in English — by suggesting that the purchase of a Christmas tree was an integral part thereof.
Speaking with the Funke Media Group, the outspoken politician said, ""When we talk about Leitkultur, about our way of life, then, for me, this includes buying a Christmas tree before Christmas.""
""It is part of our Western Christian-influenced identity,"" he continued, adding that it has been so for generations and as such influences today's children, who will continue it into the future.
Merz said he was surprised that such statements would spark accusations of religious intolerance, saying, ""I'm slightly astonished that it is apparently a problem for many when we say something like that.""  
The concept of Leitkultur has been part of German politics since the late 1990s but is still not particularly well defined.
It can often be ambiguous, for instance, whether the term lists examples of established German culture that migrants ought to accept and respect, or actually adopt themselves.
More liberal politicians often take offense to the concept, preferring to suggest immigrants integrate as part of Germany's multicultural society. Some critics of the concept saw a direct parallel to the concept of ""Germanization"" propagated by the Nazis.
Merz was careful in his comments published on Thursday at no point to take that extra step and say everyone should have a tree themselves. 
However, Merz as CDU leader has more aggressively championed the idea of Leitkultur than his predecessor Angela Merkel, and particularly the notion that there should be an onus on new arrivals to at least adapt to such customs, and in some cases to adopt them. 
Less than two weeks ago, the CDU released a blueprint for its vision of Germany's future. Among the policy points the paper highlighted was one entitled, ""The Courage to Embrace Leitkultur: Only those who acknowledge our dominant culture can integrate and become German citizens.""
Merz's comments drew mixed reactions online from politicians and observers alike but did thrust the term Leitkultur to the top of trending topics on social media websites like X, formerly Twitter, for most of Thursday.
One retired former German Cabinet minister, Ruprecht Polenz, interpreted Merz's comments as an implicit demand for people to buy Christmas trees. Given his background with the neoliberal FDP, which also lays importance on individual liberty and autonomy, he objected. 
""Respect and tolerance are crucial for the cultural climate in a pluralistic society. Indeed, both must be demanded. But that is something different to demanding certain practices from EVERYONE,"" he said. 
Green party politician Konstantin von Notz responded twice, first lamenting that the CDU's behavior under Merz ""looks like political self-destruction."" He added: ""They're betting totally unreservedly on populism, divisiveness and demagoguery. That's the way for the [party] to demolish itself."" 
But within nine minutes, following a series of critical replies and allusions to the Greens' struggles in opinion polls compared to the CDU, von Notz posted a picture of himself sat in front of his Christmas tree at home. 
""Leitkultur so close behind me that it prickles...,"" he wrote. ""So, now, everybody, stop this nonsense and enjoy yourselves!""
Volker Beck, a former Green party Bundestag member, said he considered Christmas trees, an angel atop them, choirs, the Nativity scene, German festive snacks and goose all to be part of the season in Germany.
""It's customs and tradition. So what? Guiding culture? Or culture,"" he pondered. 
An environmental lobby group, BUND, meanwhile posted links to its past studies about pesticides on Christmas trees. 
And finally, the satirical website Der Postillon rushed to put together its definitive picture gallery of examples of German Leitkultur, including everything from putting towels on sun loungers to socks with sandals, driving at racing speeds on highways, beer, stockpiling toilet paper and ""going to church once a year,"" presumably meaning around this time of year.
The first recorded Christmas tree was placed in the Cathedral of Strasbourg in the 16th century by German Lutherans, and the idea started to catch on in public places thereafter. But the idea of having a tree at home started to gain popularity in 18th and 19th century among Germany's bourgeoisie. The practice was firmly embedded all social classes by the late 19th century.










Merz hails from Germany's Christmas tree capital, the western Sauerland region of Westphalia, which supplies many of the estimated 30 million trees put up in households and businesses across the country each December.

https://www.dw.com/en/africans-differ-over-clerical-blessings-for-same-sex-couples/a-67787488,RELIGION,Africans differ over clerical blessings for same-sex couples 21.12.2023,"Homosexuality is a controversial topic in Africa, a continent where many people have strong and very conservative views on sexual orientation.
Pope Francis' recent approval of blessings for same-sex couples has left many Africans confused, triggering mixed emotions.
""As a Christian I am very embarrassed. What the pope did, he represented himself not the whole of Christians,"" Mary Lesiba of South Africa told DW. ""How can he say he is a Christian when he is busy approving such things?""
Ayeah Alain Bravo from Cameroon also shares similar discontent. ""[The decision] does not make sense to me,"" he said. ""It makes some of us start doubting religion or feeling reluctant or trying to lose my faith.""

Such strong reactions worry Francis Mpekansambo, a devout Catholic and religious analyst from the southern African nation of Malawi.
He said the pope's authorization of blessings for same-sex couples has sparked confusion because it's being misconstrued to mean that he is giving his approval to homosexuality.
""The church in Africa has received the news with mixed reaction and in somewhat a confused state,"" Mpekansambo told DW.
The Vatican said on Monday that following the pope's authorization, Catholic priests can now administer blessings to same-sex couples under the condition that they are not part of regular church rituals or liturgies.
But such blessings, according to a document from the Vatican's doctrinal office, serve only as a signal that God welcomes everyone.
The move doesn't change the church's stance on homosexuality. It remains of the position that marriage is strictly between a man and a woman, although the pope has expressed support for same-sex civil unions. 
But in Africa, where many nations have laws that restrict rights of LGBTQ+ people, some feel there can be no justification for the Catholic Church's decision.
""I think this is disheartening,"" Osman Mrong from Gambia told DW. ""Disheartening in the sense that the key person like that of the pope would come up with such an idea. Because same-sex marriage, both Islam and Christianity condemn it.""
The Catholic Church's document on the issue, though, is asking priests not to ""prevent or prohibit the church's closeness to people in every situation in which they might seek God's help through a simple blessing.""

Mpekansambo blames Western media for blowing the pope's stance out of proportion.
""Culturally Africa cannot accept homosexuality. The unfortunate thing as well is that the statement by the Vatican was hijacked by the Western circular media [that] picked what they wanted and spun it,"" he told DW.
""The pope in its communication affirmed the Catholic teaching that the Catholic Church cannot accept same-sex unions.""
The LGBTQ+ community across Africa has constantly sought recognition and the right to live without restrictions and discrimination, on a continent that is largely apprehensive toward its members.
Njeri, who is from the Kenyan LGBTQ+ community, told DW that she feels happy about the Catholic Church's decision.
""Honestly, it feels like a step in the right direction, even if it is a small one. The pope acknowledging our relationship, even just saying that they can be blessed, carries weight here in Kenya,"" Njeri said.
But she quickly added that her community wants more than just blessings for couples.
""It is not everything we want. Recognition is great but full marriage, equality, legal protection and societal acceptance are still hurdles we face every day,"" she said.
Reverend Sharon Cox from the Triangle Project, an LGBTQ+ organization based in South Africa, told DW that the the community in Africa is not seeking blessings from priests.
""Anytime anybody advances equality, it is a good step. But what Pope Francis has done is only allowing the blessing of same-sex couples and a blessing is defined by Pope Francis as people's increased trust in God. This is something people can do on their own. They don't need a blessing,"" she said.
Cox added that what the community needs is equality and an end to discrimination.
""What the world needs is equality, that it is seen that equality means whatever you have the right to, I have the right to and that would be complete equality,"" she pointed out.

South Africa is considered the most LGBTQ+ friendly country in Africa. It's the only African country where same-sex marriage is legal — however, it has a high rate of homophobic attacks.
Thembi Sindani, who lives in Johannesburg, told DW that the pope's decision was appropriate and in the best interest of the LGBTQ+ community's safety.
""What the pope did was very respectful and very good. He allowed Christians, homosexuals to come out and come forward without society judging them,"" she said.
Malawian Chancy Phiri agrees with Sindani, saying the pope's decision was an act of kindness.
""I don't have any problem with Catholic priests blessing same-sex couples,"" he said, adding that to do so is not a crime. ""It is something that would let them come closer to the word of God.""
Since 2013, the Catholic Church under Pope Francis has made an effort to make the church more welcoming to LGBTQ+ people while maintaining its stance on same-sex unions.
Yamikani Zulu, a resident of Lilongwe in Malawi, believes the pope and the Catholic Church were under pressure to offer an open-arm welcome to gay people.
""It was obvious enough that eventually all the churches would fall into the pit of homosexuality inclusiveness in the name of fighting for people's right to just spread God's love,"" she said. ""I personally think this decision was made out of pressure.""
Njeri from Kenya's LGBTQ+ community said she hopes the Catholic Church's decision would eventually soften hearts of many Africans toward homosexuality and LGBTQ+ rights.
""I see this as a crack in the wall,"" she said. ""People might be more open to listening now, to also understanding that our life is also just like anyone else's.""
She said she hopes there will be a future for her in Africa, having the freedom to be her true self.
""This feels like small victory, but one that gives me hope for a future where we can be open and loved just for being who we are,"" she added.

https://www.dw.com/en/a-turning-point-for-batteries-in-the-global-energy-transition/a-67701201,NATURE AND ENVIRONMENT,"Solar, batteries and heat pumps led the green charge in 2023 21.12.2023","Fossil fuels still supply around 80% of the world's energy needs, but 2023 saw significant advancements in renewable power.  
The intergovernmental International Energy Agency (IAE) said that global renewable energy capacity experienced its largest-ever growth this year, calling the increase ""unprecedented.""
Overall, experts say 2023 was a watershed moment for the global energy landscape, with renewable sources like solar and wind and other innovative technologies shaping a more sustainable future.
Claudia Kemfert of the Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research told DW that the increasing affordability of renewable power had led to a turning point for energy systems.
""For the first time, more investments are flowing into solar energy than oil extraction,"" added Kemfert. 
Solar completely exceeded expectations ""once again"" as a result, said Gunnar Luderer, an energy systems expert at Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).
According to forecasts, new solar power installations around the globe were expected to hit a total capacity of 400 gigawatts (GW). In 2022, the increase was 239 GW.
Some 110 GW of wind power was newly connected to the grid in 2023, according to the World Wind Energy Association.
This year also saw the completion of four new nuclear reactors with a total capacity of 4 GW, while five old reactors with a capacity of 6 GW were decommissioned in Germany, Belgium, and Taiwan.
The favorable cost of electricity from renewables was one of the main reasons behind the strong growth in wind and solar.
Electricity produced by new onshore wind turbines cost 3 euro cents (3 US-dollar cents) per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in 2022 on average worldwide, according to a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
Electricity produced in large solar parks was 4.5 euro cents per kWh. That's significantly cheaper than fossil fuels, which cost up to 22 euro cents per kWh globally.

The price of electricity from new solar installations continued to drop in the past 12 months, primarily because solar modules have become more affordable. In Europe, costs were 40% lower than last year.
China's expansion of solar module production was one of the main drivers of falling prices. According to the UK-based environment website Carbon Brief, the country produces 600 GW of solar cells annually — 225 GW more than in 2022. By 2025, it could reach 1,000 GW.
India, the US, and the EU also plan to invest more in large solar factories. In India, modules with an annual capacity of 100 GW are set to be manufactured in 2027, and companies in the EU will start manufacturing modules with 30 GW in 2025.
""It's happening faster than expected,"" said Niklas Höhne from the NewClimate Institute, a think tank based in Cologne, Germany. ""In particular, photovoltaics are being expanded extremely quickly. And, in fact, so quickly as to align with the 1.5-degree Celsius goal.""
""The year 2023 could go down in history as the turning point for batteries in the global energy transition,"" said Christian Breyer, a professor of solar economics at LUT University in Finland.
Lithium, cobalt and nickel batteries are well-established, ""but now sodium-ion batteries are also being introduced to the market,"" said Breyer.
Lithium is rare and expensive, whereas sodium for new sodium-ion batteries is much cheaper, and the supply is virtually unlimited, for example, in table salt.
According to the business magazine Clean Thinking, the price of sodium batteries is already 40% lower than that of lithium-ion cells. However, they are still in the early stages of commercial development and currently make up less than 1% of batteries. In the future, sodium could be used primarily for stationary batteries.
Still, commonly used lithium-ion batteries are becoming cheaper due to the falling price of raw materials.
Batteries are increasingly used with small solar systems and in solar parks to store inexpensive electricity for nighttime use. More batteries are also required as electric mobility expands. The share of electric cars in global vehicle sales rose from 1.6% in 2018 to around 18% in 2023.
Progress is also being made in heating technology. According to the IEA, heat pumps are becoming a key technology in the global transition to a sustainable heating supply.
""The technology can be deployed on a large scale. Many countries, especially in Scandinavia, show how well the technology works, even when it gets very cold, as it is in Finland,"" said LUT's Breyer.
According to the IEA, heat pumps cover about 10% of global heat demand in buildings. In 2022, sales of the technology increased 11% globally and 38% in Europe. In Germany, preliminary figures show 2023 sales soared almost 50% on the previous year.

Despite the growth, ""investments in heat pumps still lag behind what's necessary to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement,"" says Roland Rösch, Director of the IRENA Innovation and Technology Centre.
To keep within the 1.5 C limit and avoid catastrophic climate change, the current $64 billion in annual global financing for heat pumps needs to quadruple by 2030, according to IRENA.

German retailers remain gloomy about their earning prospects in the upcoming months, too, according to the report released by the Munich-based Ifo Institute.
""For many retailers, business in the first weeks of the holiday season wasn't as good as they had hoped,"" Ifo's Patrick Höppner said.

Sellers of toys and consumer electronics, as well as of electrical goods and electronic household appliances, were more pessimistic about their business prospects in December than they were in November.
These products are commonly sold during the Christmas season and make up a significant chunk of the retailers' annual sales.
The economic institute said its business situation indicator for retail slumped to -12.1 in the final month of the year, down from -8.8 in November.
Improving its inflation rates from last year, Germany — the biggest economy in Europe — has seen a steady decline in inflation this year. The inflation rate in November stood at 2.3% compared to a peak of 11.6% in October 2022.
However, the chances of a bump in inflation rates are still rife as the government plans to cut subsidies and introduce new taxation rules in the 2024 budget.

https://www.dw.com/en/how-trump-can-run-for-us-president-despite-legal-troubles/a-67728170,POLITICS,How Trump can run for US president despite legal troubles 20.12.2023,"COVID cases are on the rise, Taylor Swift released the best-selling album of the year and the fight between Joe Biden and Donald Trump is heating up. Sounds like 2020? That's right. But it's also where we are right now.
Though the Republicans haven't yet formally decided who their candidate will be in the 2024 US presidential elections, it's looking more and more likely that it will be former President Trump again. Nowhere does it say that the two terms each president is allowed must be consecutive.
Trump's campaign suffered a setback on Monday, December 19, 2023, when the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that he wasn't eligible to run for president in the state on the grounds that he had committed insurrection with his involvement in the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The judges pointed to the 14th amendment to the Constitution, which bans people who have sworn to protect the US Constitution and then engaged in insurrection from holding federal office again. 
But the amendment is from the time of the Civil War, and it does not clearly refer to presidents. Trump's campaign has already announced they'll appeal, bringing the case to the US Supreme Court where conservative justices, three of whom were appointed by Trump himself, hold a 6-3 majority. Unless the case is resolved quickly, with the Supreme Court siding with the Colorado judges by a deadline in early January, Trump's name will still appear on the state's Republican primary ballot.  
In nationwide polls Trump has been ahead of fellow Republican candidates like Florida governor Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina governor and UN ambassador Nikki Haley, usually by a wide margin.

Donald Trump is the only US president to be impeached twice. In both cases, the House of Representatives charged Trump with articles of impeachment (in 2019 it was abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, in 2021 it was incitement of insurrection), but the Senate acquitted him.
Only if the Senate, the higher chamber of Congress, convicts a president is he or she removed from office, a step that comes with the ""disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States"" again, as stipulated in the Constitution.   
So the double-impeachment is no legal hindrance. But what about Trump's other troubles with the law?
The trials about to start against Trump in 2024 include civil fraud trials related to how Trump and his sons ran the family business, and a sexual assault and defamation trial. In the latter case, a jury had already found Trump liable for defaming a former columnist, with the judge concluding that Trump raped the woman and then denied it. The upcoming trial is supposed to determine how much Trump will have to pay the writer for defaming her.
There are also several cases against the former president related to his behavior after losing the 2020 election: A federal criminal trial in Miami in which Trump is charged with keeping classified government documents at his Mar-a-Lago home when he was no longer president, a racketeering trial in Georgia that has Trump and 18 other defendants charged with interfering with 2020 election results, and a US Department of Justice case in which Trump is charged with felonies in connection with his attempt to remain in power after losing in 2020.

No matter the outcome of these trials, though, Trump would not lose the eligibility to run for president. The US Constitution has no limits regarding criminal convictions for presidential hopefuls.
""There are several arguments over whether a presidential candidate who is indicted or is involved in an on-going legal case should still run for office,"" Laura Merrifield Wilson, associate professor of political science at the University of Indianapolis, told DW. ""But those are based on morals, judgement, and preferences, not overt laws or procedural barriers."" 
If convicted of a felony in the Mar-a-Lago case, Trump would not be allowed to vote (in Florida, felons lose that right), but he could still run for the highest office in the country. Even if he were sent to prison, it would not interfere with his candidacy. What would happen if Trump won the presidential election while in prison, however, is unclear.
""We’re so far removed from anything that’s ever happened,"" Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley, told the New York Times. ""It’s just guessing.""
Legally, the trials don't hurt Trump's presidential aspirations. But what about his appeal to voters?
Independents ""may be turned off by a very salient conviction of Trump,"" Christopher Federico, professor of political science and political psychology at the University of Minnesota, told DW. But ""I don't think any convictions are going to hurt him with his true base within the Republican party.""
Federico's colleague and fellow political psychologist Howard Lavine also says the criminal charges haven't hurt Trump with his supporters ― on the contrary.
""Each indictment seemed to bolster Trump's potential vote-share,"" Lavine told DW. ""He's framed this [to his voters] as 'They're trying to exact retribution against me as a proxy for exacting retribution against you.'""

Both Federico and Lavine say that Trump has intuitively been very successful at connecting with his voter base ― whites without a college degree and conservative Black and Latino men. He makes them feel that he's an outsider just like them and thus understands their anger and fear at being left behind by the elites in Washington.
Social reforms on gender issues and increased efforts for more equality and inclusion have fanned the flames of that fear, Lavine says.
""Being heterosexual isn't any better than not being heterosexual, being a man doesn't give you quite the status it once did, whites are decreasing as a proportion of the American population, and we will soon be a country in which Christians will be the minority,"" Lavine said. ""This is threatening the majority status of white Christian men. A lot of people feel like their social prestige is being decreased. And it appears Trump is able to laser-focus on these fears.""
His core supporter base, the experts say, want to feel represented and seen, and believe that Trump will fight to bring them back to their former glory ― to ""make America great again."" Potential criminal convictions don't matter for that.
""I don't think Trump supporters would turn their back on him, period,"" Wilson said. ""They remain steadfast and loyal, even if not to the man, certainly to the mythological representation of what he stands for.""

https://www.dw.com/en/how-a-turkish-industrial-firm-expands-to-bosnian-propaganda/a-67769270,POLITICS,How a Turkish industrial firm expands to Bosnian propaganda 20.12.2023,"The ""gang of five"" is the name critics gave the top five companies that have consistently been awarded the biggest infrastructure projects by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government in Turkey. Among them Mehmet Cengiz, the CEO of Cengiz Holding.
From building Turkey's first nuclear power plant to allegations of importing record amounts of sanctioned goods, Cengiz Holding has been involved in a myriad of business operations. Between 2002 and 2020, the company secured $42.1 billion (€38.3 billion) in contracts.
DW Turkish, together with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), also revealed in the Pandora Papers and Panama Papers that Mehmet Cengiz used tax havens to invest some of his wealth.
Cengiz Holding hit the headlines several times over the past decade, primarily because of controversies over public tenders awarded directly to the company but also due to threats to media professionals and the environmental impact of their projects.
Public documents obtained by DW show Cengiz Holding decided to write the headlines itself — and chose to do it in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Eti Bakir is among the dozens of companies managed by the holding company. Eti Bakir, in turn, funded Simurg Media in Bosnia and Herzegovina with approximately €29,000 in 2015. Simurg Media manages two media outlets: Faktor, a daily online news website, and STAV, a weekly political magazine.
Borka Rudic, secretary general of the Association of Journalists of Bosnia and Herzegovina, told DW that Simurg Media's publications are aimed at the Bosniak ethnic group, which makes up half of the country's population.
""We are a small market, as a country, and Simurg Media has only focused on one part of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina,"" Rudic said. ""It has no chance to make a profit or to be a sustainable media company.""
According to Rudic, the apparent lack of potential profit indicated Cengiz Holding's media investment is ""politically motivated.""
Turkish journalist and academic Can Ertuna said it has become common practice for businesses to enter the media landscape without ""the sole purpose of making money from journalism or publishing.""
Ertuna said international companies, such as Cengiz Holding, ""do not enter the media for profit, but for the survival of their business relations,"" and added that ""when there are no legal obstacles, they aim to create a sphere of influence for themselves.""
Cengiz Holding has repeatedly won record-breaking contracts in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 2012. The total value of two highway projects it undertook in 2012 alone was $383 million. Between 2018 and 2020, the tenders rewarded to the company amounted to over €275 million. In March 2023, Cengiz Holding won another record-breaking tender valued at €420 million.
According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK), the trade volume between Turkey and Bosnia and Herzegovina amounted to €900 million in 2022. In the country with an annual gross domestic product of €24 billion, the total value of the tenders won by Cengiz Holding in the last 11 years exceeds €1 billion. 
Much of the financing for these projects was provided by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank.
According to Ertuna, the conditions for companies doing business abroad cannot be considered completely independent of foreign policy — especially between countries with good relations. ""It is obvious that companies that receive some form of public support have an advantage over others,"" he said.
STAV follows ""the political agenda of the SDA party (Party for Democratic Action) and reporting favourably on its members, and the Turkish President Erdogan,"" according to a 2020 report by SEENPM, a network of media centers and institutes in central and south eastern Europe.
The report, published with the support of the European Union, added that ""any kind of criticism against the party has been portrayed as attacks against the Bosniaks and the state.""
Given their existing network of relations in Turkey, Ertuna called it unsurprising that companies like Cengiz Holding ""invest in media for the benefit of the government that supports their investments abroad and for the survival of their own business relations in that country.""
Sociologist Dirim Özkan, who has lived in Sarajevo for years, said the SDA party, founded in 1990 by Bosnian politician Aliya Izetbegovic, comes from an Islamist tradition and is supported by Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) government. 
""The SDA is a party that can be considered neo-Ottomanist,"" Özkan said, emphasizing the ideological aspect of Erdogan's support for the party.
""Serbia is the big brother of Bosnian Serbs. Croatia is the big brother of Croats. Bosniaks and Muslims have no one to lean on. Turkey is positioned as their protective brother,"" he said.
The Turkish move to support Bosnia's SDA, according to Özkan, comes despite low levels of international trade between the countries.
European statistical agency Eurostat data showed that 5.9% of Bosnia and Herzegovina's imports in 2022 came from Turkey, and 1.7% of the country's total exports went to Turkey.
""Even if the discourse maintains a resolute tone, it holds symbolic significance for conservative voters in both nations, "" Özkan said.
The SDA is currently led by the founder Aliya Izetbegovic's son Bakir Izetbegovic, who served two terms as the Bosniak member of the Bosnia and Herzegovina presidency between 2010 and 2018. Erdogan, whom Izetbegovic called ""my brother and friend,"" was the official witness at Izetbegovic's daughter's wedding in 2021 — making the political closeness between the two leaders clear.
""The fact that Izetbegovic and President Erdogan had emotional moments on TV, their brotherhood is affecting Muslim voters in Bosnia,"" Özkan said.
After losing a presidential election in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Fahrudin Radoncic, a media magnate and one of Bakir Izetbegovic's most important political rivals, commented, ""I fought not only against Izetbegovic but also against Recep Tayyip Erdogan in this election.""
Selma Zulic Siljak, a project coordinator and researcher at the Mediacentar Sarajevo, said the friendship between Izetbegovic and Erdogan is often portrayed in the media, especially during elections.
""We observe that hate-oriented discourse increases especially during election periods,"" said Siljak, adding that her organization ""red flagged"" the daily online news website, Faktor, for ""publishing disinformation.""
Both STAV and Faktor were among the media listed for providing biased reporting by a Mediacentar Sarajevo report titled ""Harmful discourse during the elections"" that analyzed media reporting during Bosnia and Herzegovina's 2022 general election.
The two organizations mainly targeted opposition parties and former SDA members, the report added. 
Experts assert that advertisements are not enough to sustain STAV's large editorial staff and question the source of the rest of the organization's funding. 
Journalist and academic Ertuna called it ethically problematic for media organizations toserve the public interest by keeping tabs on all branches of government when they are funded by conglomerates that receive public tenders. 
""In fact, for media companies to have business relations with the institutions that they are supposed to examine on behalf of society raises serious questions about the extent to which such a task can be fulfilled,"" Ertuna said.
Mehmet Cengiz and Utku Gök, Cengiz Holding's Bosnia and Herzegovina manager, did not respond to DW's request for comment.

https://www.dw.com/en/fifa-club-world-cup-to-clash-with-womens-euro-2025/a-67767662,SOCCER,FIFA Club World Cup to clash with Women's Euro 2025 20.12.2023,"Amid concerns about player burnout, a lack of consultation and a weariness at futher expansion of an already bloated football calendar, the scheduling clash between FIFA's new 32-team men's Club World Cup in the USA and UEFA's Women's Euros in 2025 has largely been glossed over.
With the women's game experiencing unprecedented growth spurred on by Euro 2022 in England and cemented by the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, there are concerns about having to compete for attention with FIFA President Gianni Infantino's new attempt to expand FIFA's influence on the ever-more lucrative men's club game 
UEFA, European football's governing body, recently awarded Euro 2025 to Switzerland. They told DW it is ""essential that the women's international match calendar, including its final tournaments, are rolled out with consistent timings,"" meaning that it's tournament will run from July 2 to 27, much as the 2022 tournament did. The women's Africa Cup of Nations is likely to run at a similar time, though dates are unconfirmed. 
""Women's tournaments shall not be simply moved around the men's game and therefore accept an irregular scheduling every year,"" the statement from UEFA continued, before acknowledging that: ""Since the two tournaments will be played in two different continents and different time zones, we do not envision many matches being scheduled at the same time across the two tournaments.""
The Swiss FA responded to DW's query with a remarkably similar statement while FIFA confirmed that the calendar was agreed with all federations, including UEFA, but that the ""most balanced solution"" had been found.
""There is an inevitable degree of overlap between competitions and between calendars for both men and women, and this is even more so as women’s game rightfully progresses to sit alongside the men’s game where it belongs,"" a statement sent to DW read while also pointing to different kickoff times. ""FIFA has done it’s upmost, to invest in and develop women’s football in recent years to help expedite this process.""
A Club World Cup for women is reportedly in the pipeline. But given theobstacles women's football has had to, and continues to, face, scheduling a men's tournament featuring many of the world's top players between June 15 and July 13, meaning an 11 day overlap, is significant. The success of World Cup 2023 and Euro 2022 proved that standalone women's tournaments can draw large audiences, both on screen and in stadiums. But neither were competing against a major male football tournament.
Infantino's organization have already come in for some criticism for their 2025 plan, notably from Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva.
""We were not consulted but we try to do our job,"" Silva said when asked whether players had been given a say in the decision ahead of the start of City's current Club World Cup campaign in Saudi Arabia.
""The reality is that the amount of games we have nowadays, and even more with the new competitions, it's a bit crazy because of the [lack of] rest players get, and then the risk of injuries goes up quite a lot.""
The Portuguese player went on to say that they ""cannot complain because we earn a lot of money"" but that he felt the quality of football would suffer from scheduling that makes it ""complicated"" for elite players to be at peak fitness all the time.
""I am not going to lie, sometimes I feel tired. We play every three days, we don't rest. We have no Christmas, we have no summer. But that's the price you pay for being at a top club and fighting for all competitions, and in the end our dream was to play at this level.""
But FIFA's chief of global football development, Arsene Wenger, appeared to dismiss such concerns. 
""I accept that the football calendar is a busy one, but this is a competition that is going to take place every four years and of course the rest period during the competition and afterwards has to be respected,"" the former Arsenal coach said. 
""The welfare of the players in the last 20 years has increased dramatically as well, when you look at injury prevention, recovery work, nutrition and advances in medical technology. It is unrecognizable from what it used to be.""
However, global players' union FIFPRO, reacted to FIFA's stance with some dismay.
""Once again, decisions to scale competitions have been introduced without implementing appropriate safeguards, and without any say from the players who are at the forefront of driving the game's popularity and revenue generation with their skill and endeavour,"" their statement, released on December 17, read.
The union has previously released multiple reports that found the drastically increased load on players from travel and matches has led to increased mental and physical problems for players at the top level. FIFPRO say these players have repeatedly expressed concerns about ""exhaustion, physical injuries, mental health issues, diminished performance, and risks to career longevity"" but are being ""ignored.""
The concerns appear to be legitimate, with female players suffering more injuries, particularly to the ACL. A recent survey found that in England's Premier League, where many top internationals play, hamstring injuries are up 96% this season, with all injuries up 55% this term compared to last.
Reasons for this may include the increased workload in England with 20 teams in the league and an extra cup competition, the increase in injury time at the end of matches and the knock-on effects on the 2022 World Cup being played in the middle of the European season.
That final concern may well rear it's head again in 2034, when Infantino has announced the men's World Cup will almost certainly be hosted by Saudi Arabia. But any impact that may have on the players seems not to be of great concern to FIFA.

https://www.dw.com/en/congo-why-are-elections-in-drc-so-important/a-67767599,POLITICS,Congo: Why are elections in DRC so important? 20.12.2023,"Millions of eligible voters turned up to cast their ballot in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on Wednesday, in an election seen as a test of incumbent President Felix Tshisekedi's commitment to steer the country toward much-needed peace and development. 
Tshisekedi's main challengers are Moise Katumbi, Martin Fayulu, and Nobel laureate Denis Mukwege. There is a lot at stake for Tshisekedi to fulfill his earlier promises if he wins a second term.
Like many Congolese, 27-year-old motorbike taxi driver Georges Bamue is disappointed with the current state of affairs in Congo.
Five years after graduating with a diploma in computer network maintenance, Bamue still navigates the streets of Congo's regional capital in the east, Goma, unable to find a job or raise funds to start a business using his qualification.
""I said to myself as soon as I graduated, now, at least, I can get off the bike because now, with these diplomas, if I can find something to do, they can hire me. And that was not the case,"" Bamue told the Reuters news agency.
With Congo's rampant inflation, the depreciation of the local currency and multiple demands on his meager income, Bamue said he struggles to make ends meet paying rent and making sure his family doesn't go hungry.    
Bamue, like millions of Congolese, has seen little improvement in living conditions despite Congo's vast critical minerals wealth — and promises made by Tshisekedi when he came to power in 2019.
""I am not happy because the country is not helping us young people. Especially young people who have studied. I sacrificed myself to go to college to study. But you end up like that, there's no work. The dream you had, everything is gone. So, it can't go on like this,"" said Bamue. 

Fighting between a myriad of rival armed groups over land and resources — not to mention brutal attacks on civilians — has intensified in eastern Congo in recent years, a legacy of regional wars that flared during the 1990s and 2000s. 
One such group, the M23 — a rebel group that DRC authorities accuse Rwanda's government of backing — has captured swaths of territory since launching a campaign in 2021. Voters in the areas of North Kivu province occupied by M23 fighters were not able to vote on Wednesday.
Other groups such as the ""Islamic State""-affiliated Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), and the Cooperative for the Development of the Congo (CODECO) group that claims to defend the interests of Lendu farmers, carry out regular assaults.
A statement released by the US Embassy in the capital, Kinshasa, ahead of the election said the eyes of the world will be focused on Congo this week as it marks another significant milestone in its history.
""At this important moment in Congolese history, it is incumbent on Congolese institutions to fulfill their constitutional mandates with the independence and integrity that the Congolese people expect,"" the statement said.
The United States also reaffirmed its readiness to use all available tools, including visa restrictions, to promote accountability for any individual involved in subverting elections or otherwise undermining the democratic process.
""Congo is an incredibly influential state. Insecurity in the country tends to spill over borders into the wider region and much of the world has an economic interest in the natural resources that Congo produces,"" Phil Clark from London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) told DW.
Congo is a test for the international community, according to Clark, who said that whether Wednesday's election goes smoothly and fairly is of enormous consequence far beyond Congo's borders.
The size of Western Europe, the Democratic Republic of Congo is the second-largest African country in terms of surface area, and the fourth most populous state on the continent, with an estimated 100 million inhabitants. 
Congo is awash with minerals and precious stones, from gold, diamonds and coltan to tin, copper and cobalt. Harboring the Congo River ­— the second-longest river in Africa after the Nile — Congo also has huge hydroelectric potential, as well as 80 million hectares (197 million acres) of arable land. 
""One of the reasons that the Congolese elections are so important globally is that Congo is one of the largest producers of the natural resources that are so central to the global economy,"" said Clark. ""That includes enormous lithium reserves that are central to the sustainable and environmental manufacturing plans that many countries have.""
""So continued instability and insecurity in eastern Congo undoubtedly will affect the ability of global companies to extract those resources to sell them safely on, on the international market. Many companies involved in those industries will be watching this election very closely,"" he added.
Countries like China, which have vast interests in Congo and exploit Congolese minerals, are often silent about what happens in the country.
""I think that's because the Chinese state and other powerful investors don't want to be seen as too entangled in the situation in eastern Congo,"" said Clark.
""They prefer to do their trade in the shadows and not to put a huge spotlight on their interests. They don't want to be seen to be meddling in the Congolese election in any shape or form,"" he added.
Tshisekedi's government has moved to renegotiate the terms of the 2008 infrastructure-for-minerals deal with Chinese investors, known as the ""deal of the century"" for its favorable conditions to China. 
Under the agreement, China promised to pay $6 billion (€5.4 billion) to build roads and other infrastructure in exchange for access to mineral rights worth $93 billion, according to the AFP news agency. Risk-averse companies that had previously avoided Congo's mining sector due to instability are taking a second look as new opportunities to tap into its minerals emerge.
Apart from China, European countries and the US also have economic interests in Congo. 
""The whole world is watching these elections very closely, even if many of these powerful investor countries are not stating their interests particularly explicitly,"" said Clark.

Congo has a history of turbulent politics. Two of its governments were overthrown violently in 1965 and then in 1997. In addition, two of the country's leaders have also been assassinated: Patrice Lumumba in 1961 and Laurent-Desire Kabila in 2001.
 Elections are often marked by violence. The vote that brought incumbent Tshisekedi to power in 2018 marked the first peaceful changeover in Congolese history, although the results were fiercely disputed. 
Decades of war, corruption and chronic mismanagement mean little of the country's enormous wealth trickles down to the population. About two-thirds of the Congolese population survive on under $2.15 a day, according to the World Bank.  
The cost of living has increased and the country relies heavily on imports of basic food stuffs. The depreciation of the Franc Congolais, or Congolese franc (CDF) has pushed up inflation, which surged to over 23% year-on-year in July 2023, according to the IMF.
Tshisekedi successfully negotiated a $1.5 billion program with the International Monetary Fund in July 2021, the first since the IMF broke ties with Kinshasa in 2012 under Tshisekedi's predecessor Joseph Kabila, Reuters reported in November.
More than 26 million people require humanitarian assistance, in part because of rampant insecurity, data from the United Nations' International Organization for Migration show.
Despite the shortfalls, Congo's economy grew by 8.5% in 2022 — one of the fastest rates of growth in sub-Saharan Africa — driven by stronger mining output, according to the IMF, Reuters reported.

https://www.dw.com/en/congo-election-north-kivu-hopes-next-president-brings-peace/a-67737240,POLITICS,Congo election: North Kivu hopes next president brings peace 19.12.2023,"Mahoro Esperance is no stranger to navigating the dangers of conflict in and around her home. The 23-year-old mother of one was born in the territory of Masisi, one of the most unstable areas in the Congolese province of North Kivu.
Most recently, her region was the scene of clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) rebels and the Congolese army, prompting her to take refuge in a camp in a safer region.
Wracked with anxiety, Esperance — a seamstress by trade — tries to busy herself with sewing projects to take her mind off things. But it doesn't seem to be working. As she prepares to vote in the upcoming general election on December 20, the only solution she can think of is a ""powerful"" president who pushes hard for peace.
""That's what we need, because here we're suffering terribly,"" she told DW.
""If peace were to return, my life would undoubtedly change. Because I could go back to our village and do my work as a seamstress. Here, I don't find customers who pay well. They pay me between 200 (€0.06-€0.17) and 500 Congolese francs, whereas back home I [was paid] more than that."" 
Esperance is far from alone with her concerns. Teachers in North Kivu also expect the new president to take good care of them.
Jean Kaongo has been teaching for over 20 years. Now working in a public school, he said he is unable to provide for his family. He believes the president should make the well-being of teachers a priority following the election.
""We hope that the president will look after teachers well,"" he told DW. ""Life would be better then, because I'll be able to look after my family, clothe them and feed them. I could buy land where I could build, or even find rent so my family could live comfortably.""
Ever since fighting broke out in North Kivu in late 2021, socioeconomic activities have declined. Traders who once brought supplies from villages in the region have been unable to work in such dangerous conditions.
Trader Hamuli Shombo had to suspend his activities in and around Goma. He thinks the new president's first task should be to get the security situation under control so that he can get his livelihood back on track.
""Where there's no war, there's bound to be peace. Then everything will be easy to find, like food,"" he told DW.
""The agricultural products we used to bring from the surrounding regions can no longer reach the town of Goma, because the roads are closed. But if there's peace, food products can circulate easily.""
With Congo's general election fast approaching, election observers and the opposition are already concerned about a lack of transparency. They've cited issues such as illegible voter cards, electoral list delays and confusion over polling stations.
And some voters in the areas of North Kivu province occupied by M23 fighters won't be able to cast their ballots, due to the ongoing conflict.
""We fear there will be a mess on election day,"" said Luc Lutala, coordinator of the Symocel observer mission. ""Voters who don't know where to vote are voters who are stripped of their right to vote.""
Disputes over perceived electoral malpractice frequently spark violent unrest in the conflict-ridden country. Challengers to President Felix Tshisekedi — who is running for a second term in office — have called out what they claim to be an uneven playing field. They've said the authorities are planning to tip the vote in his favor through voter roll fraud.
""There is no longer democracy in this country,"" said presidential candidate Moise Katumbi, a 58-year-old mining magnate who is considered a potential front-runner.
Tshisekedi, 60, has presented himself as the most stable choice to Congo's 44 million registered voters. Congo only saw its first handover of presidential power in 2019, albeit in an election marred by voter suppression, widespread irregularities and violence.

https://www.dw.com/en/are-polands-populist-bankers-a-problem-for-pm-donald-tusk/a-67706140,BUSINESS,Are Poland's populist bankers a problem for PM Donald Tusk? 19.12.2023,"The agenda of Poland's outgoing ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS) was generally based on centralized control and financial nationalism. Many assumed this stance was rooted in ideological conviction.
But that's not necessarily so. ""The Polish case demonstrates that business may also sometimes unexpectedly push for greater state interventionism in the economy,"" says Marek Naczyk, an associate professor of Comparative Social Policy at Oxford University. 
A coalition government led by Donald Tusk, leader of the largest opposition Civic Platform party, or PO, was sworn in on December 13 after winning the October 15 elections. The party, last in government from 2007 to 2014, was by and large economically liberal. But it has since shifted to the left , promising to maintain PiS policy on universal welfare benefits, hiking public sector pay and not promising tax cuts to the nascent middle class. 
But it's how it chooses to deal with the domestic banking community that will show where the new government's priorities lie. Given its need to restore judicial independence, media freedoms and repair relations with the EU, it may have less inclination to take on the bankers who supported PiS.
Naczyk says that Poland has hugely benefited from foreign direct investment (FDI) in manufacturing industries, and that creating ""national champions"" has helped create jobs. In the long run, this has strengthened Polish democracy and its capacity to play a reliable role in European integration, he says. 
But while strategic policy moves undoubtedly matter, in the Polish case the driving force behind the rise of financial nationalism — not only under PiS, but also under the previous PO governments — was a mobilization of Polish managerial elites, particularly bankers,Naczyk believes.
""It was not PiS politicians who triggered the 'repolonization' of Poland's heavily foreign-controlled banking sector. Rather, it was Polish bankers who did it,"" he says. 
""They successfully pressed government actors to create new development institutions — Polish Investments for Development (PIR) in 2011 and the Polish Development Fund (PFR) in 2016 — to support the growth of Polish-owned 'national champions,'"" he adds.
As is the case in other dependent market economies in Central and Eastern Europe, the Polish banking sector had been overwhelmingly controlled by foreign capital. This became a problem during the global financial crisis of 2008 when foreign parent banks started trying to claim their Polish subsidiaries' excess liquidity in order to improve their own positions.
Naczyk says the Polish-born top managers of these subsidiaries, like the outgoing prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, typically resisted such attempts and became concerned about their lack of managerial autonomy. Key decisions were not made in Poland but in the parent company's foreign headquarters. Managers also bristled at the negative macroeconomic impact of excessive foreign ownership of banks, since decisions made in foreign headquarters could lead to credit crunches in Poland. 
""It is bankers themselves who managed to co-opt leading PiS politicians to further their own, much better defined, agenda for developmentalism,” Naczyk says.

Unlike PiS, PO has refrained from openly politicizing the Polish economy's excessive dependence on foreign capital in recent years, according to Naczyk. 
""Yet I do not expect the PO-led government's effective approach to foreign capital to be significantly different from the PiS approach,"" he says.
Political parties that will be part of the new coalition government have never used the term ""re-polonization"" because of its nationalist and illiberal connotations, he says.
But the PO-led government is likely to continue supporting some forms of ""economic patriotism"" while, at the same time, trying to attract greater FDI, Naczyk believes. 
Previously, these Polish bankers had stressed developmentalist approaches, which turned out to be half-baked, says Jan Boguslawski, a political economist at Sciences Po Paris.
Developmentalists see policy as a tool for shifting a nation's economy up the global supply chain, for example by focusing on companies and sectors that have the potential to become market leaders. It often requires quite authoritarian methods as it usually focuses on some sectors at the expense of others, needing, therefore, to mitigate socio-political fallout. 
In Poland, the PiS-led government after 2015 set up channels for selecting ""National Champions,"" the main one being the investment fund PFR (Polish development fund). 

But today, Poland is still a laggard in terms of investments that boost domestic competitiveness in the long run, including research and development (R&D), education and the green transition, he notes.
The country currently spends less than 1.5% of GDP on R&D — roughly half the average of Western Europe — while low private investment rates and declining public education expenditures, accompanied by a stagnant demography and a bias toward the elderly in social policy, all hinder a pro-innovation climate. 
Bogulslawski doesn't anticipate any major policy changes in the financial sector now that a PO-led government is in place. 
For PO, re-privatizing banks such as Pekao and Alior would not be strategically advantageous. It would provide PiS with political ammunition, and the new government will gladly take the opportunity to take control over some of the largest financial institutions in the country, he says. 
""PO may incrementally scale down the developmentalist agenda that flourished under PiS,"" Boguslawski says. They've shown a preference for channeling more resources towards private sector involvement, he adds.

https://www.dw.com/en/rwanda-explained-from-politics-to-human-rights-and-refugees/a-67762463,POLITICS,Rwanda explained: From politics to human rights and refugees 19.12.2023,"In an interview published on December 17, German politician Jens Spahn, a member of the opposition center-right Christian Democrats, floated the idea of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda for processing, similar to the model proposed by Britain.
Spahn's suggestion was immediately dismissed by Germany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, who called the idea ""downright childishly naive"" during a visit to Rwanda on Monday.
But the suggestion shows how the idea of offshore processing is gaining traction. It also underlines Rwanda's success in positioning itself as an international haven for asylum seekers.
Here's what you need to know about Rwanda's government, economy, human rights situation and refugee policy.
President Paul Kagame and the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) have ruled Rwanda, a small East African nation dominated by rugged mountains and fertile plains, since the end of the 1994 genocide.
On paper, the country is a multiparty democracy. But political opposition is ""nonexistent,"" as the US development agency USAID puts it.
Kagame's three election victories have been plagued by numerous and credible accusations of irregularities, including vote rigging and intimidation. Officially, he won the 2017 presidency with 99% of the vote.
The nation is designated an ""electoral autocracy"" by the Varieties of Democracy Project, an international democracy database. And it earned only eight out of 40 possible points for political rights in the 2023 Freedom in the World report.
Rwanda has ratified international and regional instruments guaranteeing human rights, which are also anchored in its constitution and other national laws.
But several observers have identified significant rights issues in Rwanda, including extrajudicial killings, people being disappeared by the government and torture of dissenters.
This has had a chilling effect on freedom of expression and association by perpetuating ""a culture of intolerance of dissent,"" finds Human Rights Watch.
As for media freedom, ""beaten down by decades of oppression, the Rwandan media landscape is one of the poorest in Africa,"" says Reporter without Borders, which ranks the country 131 out of 180 on its 2023 press freedom index.
In 1994, Kagame inherited a nation torn apart by the genocide that saw a million ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus slaughtered in just 100 days, and destroyed Rwanda's economy.
Rwanda's economy still depends on subsistence agriculture and lacks the rich natural resources of many of its neighbors.
But reform-minded Kagame has steered Rwanda to strong economic growth and ""substantial improvements"" in living standards, according to the World Bank. GDP soared by 142% from 2000 to 2020 and the number of people living under the poverty line fell to 52% by 2016-17. The country cut maternal and child mortality, and its 13 million people now are among the longest-living in sub-Saharan Africa.
Ranked one of the least corrupt nations in Africa, Rwanda has also climbed 100 places in the past decade for the ease of doing business, to second on the continent.
Rwanda is below average, however, compared to other low-income African countries when it comes to private investment, which is hindered by factors such as the low-skilled workforce, its landlocked position and the high price of electricity.
With its stability and low corruption, Rwanda has become an aid ""darling,"" receiving $1 billion a year (€914 million) — the most donor aid per capita in East Africa.
""It's the country that illustrates how development aid has been effectively used if all you're looking at is things like clean roads and nice fancy buildings … but not paying attention to peace and security, its role in regional politics and, indeed, human rights,"" said Toni Haastrup, who holds the Chair in Global Politics at the UK's University of Manchester.
It's a mixed bag.
Rwanda hosts nearly 135,000 refugees, mainly from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Not forced to live in a camp like in many other nations, they enjoy freedom of movement and have the right to work, own property, register businesses and open bank accounts.
Rwanda's ""economic inclusion"" refugee policies ""stand out as a model with lessons learned for East Africa and beyond,"" finds a 2023 report by Refugees International.
Despite this, refugees in Rwanda face prejudice and discrimination and most refugees are chronically poor. The vast majority (93%) live in camps and rely on a meager cash assistance of 10,000 Rwandan francs ($7.94 or € 7.27) a month to buy food.
Burundian refugee Kelly Nimubona told DW last year that life was tough in Rwanda. ''We can't afford to eat twice a day,"" he said, adding that there was no chance of getting work.
As well as the poverty, rights organizations say Rwanda's human rights record makes it no country for refugees.
Tellingly, the UK Supreme Court ruled in November that asylum seekers wouldn't be safe in Rwanda.

Last month, Rwanda received a new batch of refugees evacuated from Libya's notorious detention centers under a UNHCR partnership.
The country was also part of a now defunct and controversial policy to receive rejected asylum seekers from Israel. More recently, Rwanda signed agreements with the UK and Denmark to process asylum seekers, although either nation has yet to send any migrants.
Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolo told local news site KT Press that Rwanda kept an open policy for refugees because people in the country know ""what it is to be on the move, or to be displaced, just because of the history of our country.""
But for global politics expert Toni Haastrup, Rwanda's refugee policy serves another purpose.
""It's a way of legitimating Rwanda within the international community,"" she told DW. ""You're not going to scold Rwanda in global politics if it's been accepting all of these refugees on your behalf.""

https://www.dw.com/en/hope-not-all-doom-and-gloom-lots-of-progress-and-innovations-e-mobility-renewables-paris-climate/a-67701002,NATURE AND ENVIRONMENT,5 reasons to be hopeful about the climate 19.12.2023,"With carbon emissions set to reach record highs this year and global climate action falling short, it can be easy to slide into despair.
But according to a new study by the German think tank New Climate Institute, there are many reasons to remain hopeful.
The study looks at technological and societal progress in limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) as agreed in Paris in 2015 and highlights key global trends that suggest all is not lost.
The authors wrote that understanding the causes and impacts of climate change has come a long way since the Paris Agreement was adopted.
Climate change has now become a mainstream issue and is discussed among a larger segment of the population. Media coverage has also increased but so too has climate misinformation and fake news. 
Growing awareness has led to more climate protests, with young people leading global calls for urgent action in movements such as Fridays for Future, Extinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil and the Last Generation.
And people are taking to the courtroom as well as onto the streets. The report highlights a rising wave of climate litigation against states and companies. Plaintiffs are pushing for compliance with legislation to protect the environment and climate with some success. Germany passed legislation to accelerate greenhouse gas emissions cuts by 2030 after a 2021 Federal Constitutional Court ruling. 
Advances in weather attribution science, which investigates the links between extreme weather and climate change, have helped bolster legal cases.
Before the Paris Agreement, climate policies focused on reducing emissions in specific sectors, according to the authors. Today, achieving net-zero emissions across the entire economy is the goal for many countries, regions, and cities across the globe. 
By the end of 2021, 90% of the global economy included some kind of net-zero target that was leading to discussions of full decarbonization. 
""That was previously politically not acceptable,"" stated the report.
Increased ambition has not yet translated into global emissions reductions, but the authors wrote the world is on a better path than before. 
Sustainable investments were a niche endeavor over a decade ago and have ""now become a standard model in the finance world,"" according to the report.
The threat of climate litigation against companies is heating up, too. Businesses and investors are increasingly responding to societal pressure for change and recognizing the growing risk climate change poses to their wealth.
The authors also noted that the risk of investing in fossil fuels that could potentially no longer be burned or in infrastructure that may soon become defunct is making banks more reluctant to finance new coal power plants. 
Many companies are now publishing their climate risks partly on their own initiative or because of new laws. Of the 500 largest US companies listed by credit rating agency Standard & Poor's, more than 70% also disclose their emissions.
Still, according to the authors, oil and gas-based business models remain very lucrative and still dominate the market. Business models are shifting, but too slowly. Corporate lobbying is often hampering climate action.
Renewable energy costs have plummeted in the last decade at an even faster speed than predicted. They are now cheaper than new fossil fuels in 90% of the world and the cheapest source of bulk electricity generation.
Renewables such as solar and wind providing the core of global energy systems ""is a new normal,"" according to the authors. Phasing out fossil fuels ""is no longer a question of 'if' but 'when.'"" 










At the same time, the supply of renewable power is becoming increasingly decentralized, improving energy access for many private households. Investments in renewables are now five times greater than in fossil fuels.
While gaps in the deployment of wind, heat pumps and electrolyzers used to create hydrogen fuel still exist, the report stated that a ""paradigm shift on multiple levels towards renewable energy has started that cannot be reversed."" 
Electrification is playing an increasingly important role in transport and heating.
According to the study, electrically powered heat pumps are becoming the ""key technology for decarbonization"" of building heating systems. Europe saw a 38% increase in sales of heat pumps last year. 
Electric car sales worldwide have also risen much faster than expected. By 2023, 18% of all new cars sold will likely be electric, according to the study. In some countries around the world, they are already standard. All major car manufacturers have pledged to go electric in the next few years. The European Union, Canada and Chile have also set deadlines for phasing out combustion engines.

Although, high prices and the need for more investment in charging infrastructure remain roadblocks, the electrification of vehicles has grown exponentially according to the report. That's particularly the case in rich industrialized countries and China, where more and more electric trucks and buses are hitting the road.
While far more action is needed to reach the Paris Agreement targets, the authors emphasized that the world can ""draw strength"" from a continued increase in awareness, knowledge and technical know-how in tackling the climate crisis.

https://www.dw.com/en/serbian-snap-election-majority-backs-vucics-populist-party/a-67760467,POLITICS,Serbian snap election: Majority backs Vucic's populist party 18.12.2023,"Filip Svarm, editor-in-chief of the prestigious Serbian weekly magazine Vreme, is frustrated with the results of Serbia's snap parliamentary election. He already knows what will come next, he told DW: another bout of ""unbridled power for the SNS.""
Aleksandar Vucic's ruling Serbian Progressive Party won 47% of the ballots, enough to secure a comfortable majority for the coming years. It was already steering the country practically unopposed before the snap election.
The pro-European opposition alliance Serbia Against Violence (SPN), consisting of 15 parties that range from center-right to green to left, came in second with about 23% of the popular vote. But for political scientist Dusan Milenkovic, these results are not bad.
He said the conservative and democratic parties had always struggled to get a foothold in Serbia. Thus, these results were actually some of the best in the history of Serbia's multiparty system.
The coalition emerged in response to massive anti-government protests triggered by two deadly mass shootings earlier this year. It was the protests and increasingly tense relations with Kosovo that inspired Vucic to call a snap election two years ahead of schedule.
As expected, election observers and non-governmental organizations have flagged several concerns regarding vote rigging. Some 40,000 external voters were allegedly brought to Belgrade and other Serbian cities to vote for SNS using forged IDs.
Most of them are said to have come in organized bus transports from Republika Srpska, a Serb-majority entity in neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina. While these voters might be ethnic Serbs, they are formally Bosnian nationals and, therefore, do not have the right to participate in Serbian elections. The opposition filed a complaint and called for protests the day after the election.
""Serbia has voted, but the OSCE has reported abuse of public funds, intimidation of voters, and cases of vote buying,"" the German foreign ministry said in a post on social media platform X, referring to accusations by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. ""That is unacceptable for a country with EU candidate status.""
The landslide victory of the SNS is primarily thanks to Vucic himself. The populist ruler, denounced by critics as an autocrat, did not stand for elections but dominated the campaign . The SNS list campaigned with ""Aleksandar Vucic — Serbia must not stand still."" According to a poll by the Serbian election observation mission CRTA, one out of four Serbian citizens thought that Vucic himself was running for elections, and 60% believed that he was his party's lead candidate.
There are several reasons why Vucic has such an undisputed grip on Serbian politics. The ""Vucic system"" benefits from the fact that about 10% of the adult population — in a country with a population of 6.8 million — are SNS members. Vucic is known to reward party membership and votes with jobs and cash handouts.
Domestically, Vucic has boosted his popularity by stirring nationalist sentiments regarding Kosovo. He tells Serbian nationalists precisely what they want to hear: ""Kosovo must remain Serbian."" It's a potential flashpoint that has concerned the European Union for years.
Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia in 2008, which has since been recognized by the United States and most members of the EU. Serbia, Russia and several other European nations do not acknowledge the Republic of Kosovo.
Serbia's most recent EU accession progress report was not too rosy. Not least, presumably, because Serbian strongman Vucic prefers to take an anti-Western stance while expressing a pro-Russian sentiment popular with large parts of the population. Nevertheless, experts say Vucic, who served as information minister under Slobodan Milosevic, is seen as a potential guarantor for stability and, therefore, handled with kid gloves.

The fact that Vucic has been tending to friendly Russo-Serbian ties has long been a thorn in the EU's side. But that hasn't stopped the bloc from repeatedly offering the Balkan state support. It's a risky business, says Rade Basta, Serbia's former minister of economy. On Sunday, Germany's most popular tabloid newspaper, Bild, quoted him as saying that Russia was reaching for influence in the Western Balkans in order to destabilize the EU. According to him, Russian President Putin was an indirect party to any negotiation that Vucic held with Brussels. Therefore, he recommended that Brussels accept the Western Balkan nations into the EU as quickly as possible to thwart Moscow's influence in the region.
Often referred to as the Western Balkans, Serbia, Kosovo, Albania, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina have expressed their desire to join the EU for many years. All but Kosovo have been granted official candidate status.

The cause of the blast is currently unclear, with officials saying the ""scale and consequences could have a direct impact on the population.""
Residents said they were awakened by a deafening blast and shattering windows. Massive clouds of smoke covered the area, forcing hundreds of residents to flee.
""It was a deafening noise that woke us up,"" a resident told the AFP news agency. ""The windows of our home and those of our neighbors were smashed. We managed to get away from the place.""
""We heard a loud bang which threw us to the ground without understanding what was happening,"" said another resident. ""We prayed, hoping for God's favor. Others didn't try to understand, opting to head for the suburbs.""
Firefighters brought the blaze under control late Monday morning, said government sources.
By Monday evening, 113 injured people had been discharged from hospital, according to a government statement read on national television.
Scores of water trucks and civil protection vehicles were on site as security vehicles blocked off the port area.
A crisis unit, headed by Security Minister Bachir Diallo, has been set up, with rescue personnel from neighboring Senegal and Mali expected to arrive soon.
Local schools have been ordered closed and workers in the capital were told to stay home. Gas stations are also closed.
The head of Guinea's ruling military junta, Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, called for ""solidarity and prayer for the nation in this difficult time.""
Doumbouya has ruled Guinea since he led an armed overthrow of the country's first democratically elected president, Alpha Conde, in September 2021. He currently pledges a return to civilian rule by January 2026.

The Shiite Muslim alliance is likely to strengthen its power amid an ongoing boycott by populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who is the alliance's main political rival.
Polling is taking place in 15 provinces of Iraq, leaving out three that are autonomous Kurdistan regions.
Some 17 million people are eligible to cast their votes at a total of 7,166 polling stations set up across Iraq.
Polling began in Baghdad, Kirkuk and Basra at 7:00 a.m. local time (0400 GMT), as was broadcast by Iraqi state television. The polling will continue until 6:00 p.m. local time.
More than 6,000 candidates are running in the elections for just 285 seats in the provincial councils.
The elections are seen as an opportunity to redeem democracy in Iraq and pave the way for parliamentary elections scheduled for 2025. They also present a test for Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani's government, which was established over a year ago.
The elections are likely to cement the hold of the ruling Coordination Framework coalition, an Iran-aligned bloc that includes Shiite Islamist parties with factions of Hashed al-Shaabi.
The influential Shiite cleric al-Sadr has joined the opposition against the Shiite alliance and is boycotting the local elections.
A vocal critic of the United States and Iran, he said the elections will only help establish the dominance of a corrupt political class.
Many members of the Shiite alliance are running on several lists, with former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki forming his own list.
The top Sunni Muslim leaders in the country, ousted parliament speaker Mohammed Halbousi and business mogul Khamees Khanjar, are running together.

https://www.dw.com/en/covid-19-makes-wintertime-comeback-in-germany/a-67753001,SOCIETY,COVID-19 makes wintertime comeback in Germany 18.12.2023,"COVID-19 has lost much of its fearsome reputation. Most people in Germany are vaccinated or have otherwise built up a baseline immunity. Still, general practitioners like Lars Rettstadt are busy.
""It's typical infection season again. There's a lot of sniffling and coughing,"" said the doctor in Dortmund, a city in western Germany. ""When we open the door on Monday morning, there are 70 people without an appointment: men, women, young and old.""
By his estimate, 80% of them have viral infections of some kind. Half of those are COVID-19.
Without a mask mandate, most patients don't wear one. Rettstadt's practice offers them for 50 cents. He has set aside an hour just for infection appointments, and patients can also reach him by video. PCR tests are reserved for those in particularly bad shape.
""We no longer see severe cases,"" he said, adding just one patient, aged 94, had to be hospitalized due to COVID-19. 
Otherwise, symptoms reflect the regular wintry kind that keep people out of work to recover in bed at home. Yet sick days can go for as long as two weeks.
While the illness might not be fatal, it is causing massive disruptions. As much as 10% of the country sick, according to Germany's Robert Koch Institute for public health, and offices and services are struggling to stay open. And with the mix-and-mingle Christmas season coming up, Health Minister Karl Lauterbach has urged people to get their vaccinations topped up.
The official, seven-day incidence is at 38, which seems low in comparison to 2,000 during the omicron wave in early 2022. Yet with testing sporadic, that number may be deceiving. A recent test of wastewater has shown more COVID-19 in the water since this form of testing was first started in June 2022.

Other forms of PCR testing suggest a seven-day incidence of almost 3,900 in the western German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, said the Frankfurt-based virologist Martin Stürmer. That's up from 2,600 one week ago.
""We are in a phase where the coronavirus figures are increasing massively,"" he added.
The coronavirus figures are in addition to the usual cases of flu and respiratory illnesses. Yet these haven't translated into a higher burden on hospitals and ICU wards, said Stürmer. The death rate has also remained stable.
Of the many variants out there now, the ""JN.1 subvariant, another successor variant of pirola, is now responsible for almost a third of cases,"" he added. 
While the risk to the general population is low, Stürmer called on at-risk groups, including people over the age of 60, to get booster shots. These add a layer of defense against so-called long COVID, the long-term effects of COVID-19. Masks could be sensible, too, he added, although there is little public desire to go back to them.
""The willingness to be vaccinated is also certainly at a low level,"" said Stürmer. ""I think these are all factors that we could significantly improve with positive and meaningful communication.""

https://www.dw.com/en/irish-pm-varadkar-deeply-concerned-by-fire-at-asylum-home/a-67750673,SOCIETY,Irish PM Varadkar 'deeply concerned' by fire at asylum home 17.12.2023,"Police in the Republic of Ireland are investigating what they described as a ""criminal damage incident by fire"" that occurred Saturday night at a former hotel earmarked to house asylum-seekers in the village of Roscahill in western County Galway.
Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar on Sunday said he was ""deeply concerned"" about the incident.
Police said no one was in the facility when the blaze occurred. Ireland's RTE television broadcast video footage of flames partially destroying the Ross Lake House Hotel on Sunday.
The fire followed a rally at the site, with those present opposing government plans to house 70 asylum-seekers in the village.
In a statement, Prime Minister Varadkar said, ""I am deeply concerned about recent reports of suspected criminal damage at a number of properties around the country, which have been earmarked for accommodating those seeking international protection here, including in County Galway last night.""
Varadkar went on to say, ""There is no justification for violence, arson or vandalism in our Republic. Ever.""
Ireland, which is experiencing a housing crisis, has seen opposition to government policies designed to house a record number of foreign asylum-seekers of late, with largely peaceful protests being staged across the country in recent weeks.
The problem has become so acute that the agency responsible for housing asylum-seekers resorted to handing out tents to new arrivals last week.
Though Varadkar has sought to assure citizens that all of those seeking asylum in Ireland are thoroughly vetted and registered, the situation has remained tense.
Last month, the capital Dublin saw a night of massive rioting when far-right agitators torched and looted the city, destroying businesses and public property after the stabbing injury of three children outside an elementary school by a man Irish media had said was born in Algeria — although police did not confirm.
In an effort to convey the scope of the situation, Varadkar said, ""Like much of the world, we are dealing with a major step-change in the numbers [of asylum-seekers] arriving here seeking protection. This is driven by war, poverty, climate change and human rights abuses in their home countries.""
He added that the recent outbreak in violence across Ireland was to be blamed on ""a very small minority,"" noting that, ""The response from many communities has been incredible. We've seen people open their homes, schools, clubs and communities to help those most in need.""

https://www.dw.com/en/bundesliga-fans-protest-against-private-equity-investors/a-67744834,SOCCER,Bundesliga fans protest against private equity investors 16.12.2023,"Bundesliga and Bundesliga 2 fans across the country protested on Friday and Saturday against the German Football League’s (DFL) decision to seek to bring in a strategic partner.
On December 11, 24 of 36 teams between the two divisions voted in favor of a plan to secure private equity investment in return for a share of TV rights over the next two decades.
Fans from all 36 teams announced they would remain silent for the first 12 minutes of their matches across the weekend, with multiple matches interrupted by further protests.
Union Berlin fans went on to throw tennis balls and chocolate coins on the pitch, forcing a short interruption of their match at VfL Bochum.
Striker Takuma Asano ate one of the chocolate coins during the cleanup, and went on to Bochum's opener shortly before the break.
Protests on Friday had a more serious outcome, with the game between second division sides Paderborn and Hansa Rostock interrupted after Rostock fans threw pyrotechnics onto the pitch.
Rostock fans and police officers were also injured, and there was an estimated damage of €100,000 ($109,085) reported by Paderborn.
""A total of eight stewards and 12 police officers suffered injuries, one policewoman had to be treated in the hospital for a cut,"" Paderborn and the police said in a joint statement.
""It's not enough to apologize and distance ourselves, there will be severe punishment. We will have to talk about clear consequences,"" Rostock CEO Robert Marien told the Bild newspaper on Saturday. 
Elsewhere on Friday, the start of the Bundesliga clash between Borussia Mönchengladbach and Werder Bremen was  delayed for five minutes after fans threw fake coins on the pitch. This came in addition to the 12 minutes of silence at the start of the match.
""It was no fun at all, it reminded me of the coronavirus,"" Bremen midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt said of the fans' silence, referring to the games played with no paying spectators during the pandemic.
The DFL have said they are aiming to boost its business model and international marketing with the income they will receive from the strategic partner, who will have no saying in sporting matters such as fixtures lists.

https://www.dw.com/en/bundesliga-deal-what-does-private-equity-want-in-football/a-67732274,SPORTS,Bundesliga deal: What does private equity want in football? 15.12.2023,"The vote was close but, at the second time of asking, the German Football League (DFL) this week finally secured the two-thirds majority required to enter into negotiations with a ""strategic partner"" from the private equity sector with whom it hopes it will be able to boost the value of its international broadcasting rights.
Of the 36 clubs which make up the Bundesliga and Bundesliga 2, the two top divisions of German football, 24 voted in favor of handing DFL co-CEOs Steffen Merkel and Marc Lenz a mandate to negotiate a deal which could see up to €1 billion ($1.08 billion) of investment in digitalization, internationalization and global marketing in return for an 8% share of TV rights revenues over a period of 20 years.
The four front-runners interesting in sealing a deal with the DFL are all from the private equity sector: Blackstone, Advent, EQT and CVC.
Private equity firms set up funds and raise money from wealthy individuals and institutional investors such as pension funds. They usually buy companies and bring in managers who increase efficiency, often by aggressive cost-cutting and restructuring.
""After about five years, they try to sell them again for a large profit,"" explained Michael Grote, professor at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management and director at its Institute for Private Equity and Mergers and Acquisitions.
According to unconfirmed media reports, EQT from Sweden has offered to pay €1 billion for a 7.9% stake in DFL's yet to be set up marketing firm, DLF Media. Luxembourg-based CVC is said to want 8% for the same amount, while the offers of Blackstone and Advent seem be less than €1 billion.
CVC is no stranger to investments in global sports, having already negotiated similar deals with France's Ligue 1 and Spain's La Liga, plus Premiership and Six Nations Rugby, the Women's Tennis Association and Indian Premier League cricket franchise Gujarat Titans in recent years.
""Sports is an asset class that has not attracted too many investments until now,"" said Grote, suggesting that some European football leagues are not making the most of their potential when compared to other sporting competitions around the world.
""There's more turnover possible than is currently being realized. That makes it a particularly interesting target for private equity, so they can level up management and increase returns.""
Kieran Maguire, lecturer in football finance at the University of Liverpool in the UK, agrees.
""Private equity funds are particularly interested in football because it is seen as part of an entertainment industry in which prices for theaters, musicals, concerts etc. are going through the roof, and they believe there is room for such increases in football, too,"" he told DW.
""The value of NFL and NBA franchises in the United States is far higher than most European football clubs, so there's a view that, given that football is a vastly more popular game globally, it could potentially be worth even more.""
So far, so logical. But the deal which Germany's DFL is now hoping to secure, with stringent ""red lines” restricting investor influence to financial matters and preventing an investor from having any say on sporting or competition issues, is unusual from a private equity point of view.
""Typically, a private equity firm would own the whole company they invest in and they would have a very active hand in it, but this will not be the case with the DFL, so they won't be able to decide anything without the clubs' consent,"" said Grote. ""Nevertheless, it's in all parties' interest to increase the Bundesliga's market share globally and they will bring good ideas to the table.""
And Maguire has an inkling as to what those ideas might look like.
""We saw with the proposed private equity financing of the Super League [the European Super League is a planned breakaway competition, and the initial project was scrapped in 2021 — Editor's note] that they were keen to suggest splitting matches into four quarters, global TV-friendly kickoff times and games abroad, so these sorts of ideas will surely be dropped into the conversation in German football, even if they can't directly force any such ideas through.""
Another unusual element of the deal is the length of the proposed engagement.
Traditionally, private equity firms will look to take over a business and sell it on within three to five years, but the proposed DFL engagement is set to last 20 years. CVC's deal with La Liga is over 50 years.
""This is an untypical case for private equity,"" said Grote. ""However, the share of untypical private equity deals has risen. Investing in infrastructure over the course of long-term investments, investing in anything that delivers constant returns — this is becoming a new normal.""
Given the unique structure of German football, Grote considers private equity investment a logical step. ""With 36 different stakeholders, coordination is a major problem,"" he said. ""Investing in the Bundesliga is a risky endeavor, and bank loans will be either very expensive or not feasible.""
The DFL consists of 36 independent clubs, the vast majority of which are bound by the so-called 50+1 rule, which stipulates that the clubs themselves must retain majority voting rights in the commercial companies which generally run their professional football operations. Great for the fans, who can ensure that their matchday experience remains affordable and prevent their clubs simply being sold off to the highest bidder, but a turnoff for investors.
After recent attempts to challenge the legality of the 50+1 rule on competition grounds failed, the DFL has committed to the regulation and insists that a private equity deal at league level actually helps protect and preserve member-control at club level. ""If this deal goes well, both clubs and private equity will understand each other better,"" said Grote.
Maguire is also confident that the deal will achieve its aims in bringing about an increase in the value of the DFL's international TV right, but said any attempt to eat into the Premier League's advantage is going to be ""very difficult.""
""The Premier League horse hasn't just bolted; it's emigrated and started a new life far, far away,"" he said.
According to Maguire, Premier League clubs have been doing overseas tours for decades, and have the advantage of the English language, making them the first choice for football fans in most countries.
For German clubs, competing for attention will be hard. ""Fans only have a limited number of 90-minute slots available per weekend and once they've been locked into the Premier League ecosystem, watching Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea on a regular basis, where is the room in their life to watch Werder Bremen vs. Eintracht Frankfurt?""
Maguire added: ""It will be very difficult, in my view, even for the skills and wily ways of private equity to break into that market.""

For decades, she has relied on Afghan migrants to tend her farm in the southwestern province of Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan. But with Pakistani officials launching an effort to expel some 1.7 million undocumented Afghans last month, the septuagenarian has been struggling to find skilled workers to prune and fertilize apple trees and grapevines on her land.
""The crucial fertilizer time is upon me but I don't have enough workers for this job,"" she told DW. ""As my sons and grandsons live in cities for business and education, Afghan refugees cared for our orchards for years. But now as they suddenly left for home to avoid deportation, we find ourselves in a real predicament.""
Jawzara used to employ members of five Afghan Pashtun families, who fled their country after the Soviet invasion in 1979. Refugee women used to do chores in her house and men worked in fields, with the Pakistani woman and two of her sons supervising and helping them.
Even with new generations in the small community born and raised in Pakistan, they tended to live on Jawzara's farmland and be dependent on their employer for food, health care and other needs.
But the recent anti-immigrant clampdown has changed everything.

Most undocumented Afghans in Pakistan were living in Balochistan and northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces — both bordering Afghanistan — and never felt residency documents were necessary, with their lives limited to their areas.
Earlier this year, the Pakistani government declared the presence of undocumented migrants to be both a security and economic challenge. Hundreds of thousands have already been expelled or left on their own.
And, despite Pakistani officials pledging that 2.3 million legal Afghan migrants were free to remain as long as their papers are valid, more than a few documented migrants also returned to their home country. They feared that Pakistan would soon try to deport them as well, and warned that the authorities look determined to send all Afghans — whether documented or undocumented — home.
Afghan laborers have a reputation of being cheap, skilled and hardworking. They are also in a vulnerable position due to their living on foreign soil. The mass exodus has now sparked labor shortages in sectors like agriculture and mining in Pakistan's border areas.
""Orders for [undocumented] migrants to leave caught our Afghan workers, as well as us, off guard. Neither were they mentally prepared to go away on short notice, nor did we have any idea of what to do without them,"" said Jahangir Shah, who owns a coal mine in Balochistan's Duki district.
Afghans make up 60% of Shah's employees. The repatriation effort, according to the mine owner, forced him to briefly suspend mining operations. Even after the work was resumed with extended shifts, production was very slow due to labor shortages. Shah fears production targets will not be met.
""Our bids to return to normal face challenges, especially the unavailability of skilled workers,"" he told DW, adding that workers from other areas are ""not coming in despite offers of better payment.""
Pashtuns are the dominant ethnic group in Afghanistan, with millions of them also living in Pakistan. Sardar Muhammad Shafiq Tareen, a Pashtun serving as a senator in Pakistan's Balochistan, warns that almost 80% of workers in the mines and farms across the province were Afghan people.

The exodus of Afghans will also stop remittances from Pakistan into Afghanistan, harming the latter's economic development, he said. The war-ravaged country is already facing a massive crisis following the Taliban takeover in 2021.
Tareen echoed the concerns of many activists and international organizations, noting that Afghans were given very little time to return to their home country despite spending years or decades on the other side of the border. Speaking with DW, he questioned the Pakistani government narrative that most departures were voluntary.
Various political parties and trader associations have been protesting government policies since October 20 by staging a sit-in in the border town of Chaman. They have opposed visa restrictions in the wake of the anti-migrant clampdown.
Pir Muhammad Kakar, general secretary of the Balochistan chapter of the Pakistan Workers' Federation, pointed out that more than half of Afghans working in the province's mines had left, causing a ""doom scenario"" for the local mining industry, the largest income generator for the province.
Kakar said mine owners recently met caretaker Interior Minister Sarfraz Bugti — himself a Balochistan native — who pledged to ensure that Afghan mine workers aren't unduly bothered. The minister also promised a proper policy to enable the workers to continue their employment, but this promise has yet to be fulfilled, according to Kakar.

https://www.dw.com/en/uk-prince-harry-partially-wins-phone-hacking-lawsuit/a-67732640,LAW AND JUSTICE,UK: Prince Harry partially wins phone-hacking lawsuit 15.12.2023,"Britain's Prince Harry on Friday gained a partial victory in his lawsuit against a newspaper publisher over allegations of phone hacking and other unlawful acts.
The High Court in London ruled that Harry was a victim of unlawful information gathering by Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN).
The judge sided with the UK royal on 15 of the 33 articles in the lawsuit and awarded him 140,000 pounds (€163,000, $179,000) in damages. The prince had sought 440,000 pounds.
The court ruled Harry has been a victim of ""modest"" phone-hacking and other unlawful information gathering by journalists at MGN.
Piers Morgan, the former editor of the British tabloid Daily Mirror who now works for News Corp's Talk TV and writes articles for its papers, knew about phone hacking at the newspaper — according to the judge.
Morgan has always denied any involvement in, or knowledge of, phone-hacking or other illegal or unlawful activity.
He said on Friday: ""I've never hacked a phone or told anybody else to hack a phone and nobody has produced any actual evidence to prove that I did.""
Speaking outside his London home, Morgan added: ""I wasn't called as a witness... by either side in the case, nor was I asked to provide any statement. I would have very happily agreed to do either or both of those things had I been asked.""
Justice Timothy Fancourt found that phone hacking was ""widespread and habitual"" at Mirror Group Newspapers over many years and private investigators ""were an integral part of the system"" to gather information unlawfully.
He said executives at the papers were aware of the practice and covered it up.
Harry had claimed he was targeted by MGN for 15 years from 1996 and that more than 140 stories that appeared in its papers were the result of unlawful information gathering. The trial only considered 33 of these.
The prince became the first senior royal to appear as a witness in court for 130 years at the trial in June.
The UK royal family has traditionally shied away from litigation but Harry has been outspoken in his criticism of the UK media's tactics in obtaining exclusive stories.
The other claimants included actors, sports stars, celebrities and people who simply had a connection to high-profile figures who had stories published.
In a statement read by his lawyer, the prince said he was happy to have won the lawsuit, calling the outcome ""vindicating and affirming.""
""I've been told slaying dragons will get you burned. But in light of today's victory and the importance of doing what is needed for a free and honest press — it's a worthwhile price to pay. The mission continues.""
""I respectfully call on the authorities, financial regulator and the police to do their duty, to investigate and bring charges against the Daily Mirror Group [MGN],"" Harry said.
A spokesperson for MGN reacted to the ruling by saying, ""gives the business the necessary clarity to move forward from events that took place many years ago."" 
""Where historical wrongdoing took place, we apologize unreservedly, have taken full responsibility and paid appropriate compensation.""

https://www.dw.com/en/lgbtq-in-russia-living-under-threat-of-extremism-law/a-67724861,HUMAN RIGHTS,LGBTQ+ in Russia: Living under threat of extremism law 15.12.2023,"In late November, Russia's Supreme Court designated what it calls ""the international LGBT movement"" as ""extremist."" And while the law doesn't come into force until January 10, 2024, many anti-LGBTQ+ measures have already been taken. One day after the court ruling, at least three LGBTQ+-friendly clubs and saunas were raided in Moscow.
One person who wanted to remain anonymous told DW about a raid: ""The police came and locked the door so that nobody could leave the club. The said they were looking for drugs. We had to lie face down on the floor. They didn't find anything but they took all our personal details and photographed our passports.""
The Russian authorities have not yet commented on the raids. There has also been no mention of routine drug raids in the state media.
The impact on the LGBTQ+ community has been dramatic. ""None of us can live in peace anymore,"" wrote one clubber on an online platform, adding that ""we are constantly walking a fine line between 'propaganda' and 'extremism.'"" Someone else wrote that they had stopped going to clubs as it was too dangerous.
""This crosses a new line,"" Regina Dzugkoeva, a feminist and LGBTQ+ activist, told DW. ""Raids, photographing passports and acts of intimidation have happened before. But these measures were mostly directed against organizations and activists, not against ordinary LGBTQ people in Russia.""
The country's LGBTQ+ community has been subjected to ever more severe persecution in recent years. In 2013, a law banning the dissemination of supposed LGBTQ+ ""propaganda"" among minors came into force. In 2022, the ban was extended to all age groups. It applies a very broad definition of ""propaganda"" that criminalizes people who come out or even suggest that sexual orientations other than heterosexuality are normal.

The law was approved by Russian President Vladimir Putin just days after Russia's highly restrictive ""foreign agents"" legislation was further tightened. The Kremlin has been using it to target dissent, and impose even more restrictions on freedom of speech and human rights.
The broadening of the 2022 ""gay propaganda"" law has led to increased self-censorship, according to LGBTQ+ activist Svetlana Shaytanova.
""Russian history shows that self-censorship is the most effective form of censorship,"" she told DW. ""Under Stalin, certain things were banned and then publicly punished. People then resorted to self-censorship out of fear."" Shaytanova was certain that this would happen again.
TNT Music, a Russian television channel, edited out a rainbow flag that featured in a music video by the K-pop band Seventeen even before the legislation was tightened. The original ""God of Music"" video showed band members dancing in a meadow under a multicolored rainbow. It has now been swapped out for gray clouds.
In July, a Moscow court fined the owner of TNT Music, Fonbet TV, 1 million roubles (€10,000/$11,100) after it broadcast a music video for Finnish singer Alma's ""Summer Really Hurt Us,"" that shows two women dancing and kissing. The court said the video violated Russia's propaganda law. According to Russian media, there are four similar cases in court right now, with one that could end with a fine of up to 16 million roubles (€160,000/$175,000) looming.
Russian music channel AIVA has also been fined 50,000 roubles (€500/$549) for airing a video by Sergey Lazarev, who twice represented Russia at the Eurovision Song Contest, coming third both times. The video in question — titled ""Tak krasivo,"" or ""So beautiful"" — is R-rated and shows same-sex couples holding hands. The authorities said it was propaganda for ""nontraditional"" sexual relationships.
Lena Katina and Julia Volkova, who make up internationally renowned girl band t.A.T.u. and are known for kissing onstage and in their videos, are considered queer icons — though they reportedly don't identity as LGBTQ+. Last year, administrators of Russia's VKontakte social media network voluntarily deleted all pictures of the pair kissing.  Access to further band-related posts, photos and videos has apparently now been blocked.
Cinema, literature and theater have also been affected by self-censorship and bans. Russian broadcaster STS Love has removed three episodes of a TV series about two drag queens in a gay club from its media library. Books that even allude to ""nontraditional"" sexual relationships are being banned. And last year, Moscow's Bolshoi Theater canceled a play about the world-famous Russian ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev because he was openly gay.
The extremism law has already led to the closure of places where people from the LGBTQ+ community regularly meet, for example Central Station, the oldest gay club in St. Petersburg.
""The landlord refused to let us work because of the [new] law,"" the owner wrote on VKontakte. ""We apologize but we are no longer in business.""
""There will always be LGBTQ people in Russia, as there has always been,"" Dzugkoeva told DW, but she expects that many will also move abroad.
""We are receiving more and more messages from people from in Russia telling us their stories, saying they are afraid, desperate and want to leave the country,"" she said.
""But of course not everyone can just leave,"" said fellow activist Shaytanova.

https://www.dw.com/en/eu-negotiators-agree-new-rules-on-corporate-accountability/a-67717324,BUSINESS,EU negotiators agree new rules on corporate accountability 14.12.2023,"The European Parliament Legal Committee and EU governments on Thursday agreed new rules for large companies that will require them to check and remedy negative social and environmental impacts in their operations.
The committee announced the agreement in a post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.
The rules will also apply to some 4,000 international corporations with a significant foothold in the European Union.
Under the agreement, EU-based companies of a certain size will be accountable for adverse human rights and environmental impacts involved in their value chain, such as child labor, slavery, pollution and biodiversity loss.
The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) will be mandatory for about 13,000 large companies based in the bloc, including those headquartered elsewhere that do major business in the EU.
The financial sector will be temporarily excluded, but the agreement contains a clause allowing this exclusion to be reviewed.
The European Parliament and EU states still need to confirm the agreement, but this is normally a formality.
Those opposed to the rules say they are unnecessarily burdensome, as EU companies will already be required to make similar environment, social and governance (ESG) disclosures from 2024.
 A contentious issue has also been whether companies should have to publish detailed plans for transitioning to a sustainable economy. 
The new rules could also have ramifications for companies not directly affected by the rules if they belong to the supply chain of an EU business.
Global Witness, a group that campaigns against human rights abuses, called it ""shocking"" that the financial sector is currently not within the scope of the rules.
""While banks and insurers will have to implement climate transition plans — steps that would bring them closer to climate-friendly investments — the financial sector secured a
broader carve-out and will not be obliged to ensure that their loans or investments are not tied to human rights abuses,"" it said.

https://www.dw.com/en/us-house-votes-to-open-biden-impeachment-inquiry/a-67716689,POLITICS,US House votes to open Biden impeachment inquiry 13.12.2023,"The US House of Representatives on Wednesday has formally authorized the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden. 
The resolution was approved by a vote of 221 to 212. Republicans voted unanimously to formalize the ongoing investigation. Democrats voted against.
Republicans accuse Biden of being involved in controversial foreign business dealings of his son, Hunter. The president has denied the allegations.
Former Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy had already ordered a ""formal impeachment inquiry"" against Biden on September 12. The White House has rejected the investigation as unfounded and politically motivated.

Reacting to the vote, Biden said that Republicans in the House were focused on attacking him ""with lies."" In a statement released by the White House, Biden called the inquiry a ""baseless political stunt.""

So far, the investigation has found no evidence that Biden acted corruptly or took bribes in his current role or in his previous office as vice president, but Republicans are eager to continue it.
""We do not take this responsibility lightly and will not prejudge the investigation's outcome,"" Republican Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team said in a joint statement after the vote. ""But the evidentiary record is impossible to ignore.""
Meanwhile, House Democrats on Wednesday stood united in opposition to the resolution, calling it a farce perpetrated by those across the aisle to avenge the two impeachments against former President Donald Trump.
""This whole thing is an extreme political stunt. It has no credibility, no legitimacy, and no integrity. It is a sideshow,"" Democrat Jim McGovern said during a floor debate.
The Republican effort will almost certainly fail to remove Biden from office. Even if the House votes to impeach the president, the Senate would have to convict him on the charges by a two-thirds vote.
That's a near impossibility in a chamber where Biden's fellow Democrats hold a 51-49 majority. The inquiry could, however, help the Republicans to highlight their allegations of corruption for much of the presidential campaign in 2024.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-government-resolves-2024-budget-dispute/a-67716151,POLITICS,German government resolves 2024 budget dispute 13.12.2023,"After more than 200 hours of negotiations, including all-night talks, German Social Democratic (SPD) Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Green Vice-Chancellor and Economics Minister Robert Habeck and Free Democrat (FDP) Finance Minister Christian Lindner have announced a new state budget for 2024.
When Germany's governing three-party coalition took power in late 2021, it repurposed €60 billion ($64 billion) in unused COVID-era loans for climate protection efforts. Yet in November, Germany's constitutional court ruled this reallocation unlawful, sparking protracted negotiations to draw up a new budget. The government does not intend to reapply for these loans.
Instead, it wants to reign in public spending even more than previously planned, while still keeping an eye on fulfilling its major policy goals. Recently, Chancellor Scholz summarized these as such: ""We are pushing forward the climate-neutral transformation of our country, strengthening social cohesion, and standing by Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia."" Adding that ""these three goals continue to guide us, but it is clear that we have to get by with significantly less money; this means cuts and making savings.""
Germany's free-market FDP is focused on cutting public expenditure. It had entered the budget negotiations convinced that Germany should heed its constitutionally enshrined debt brake in 2024. It stipulates that, in principle, the German state should only spend as much as it earns. It only allows the government to take out loans to a limited extent, unless it faces an emergency, in which case the debt brake may be suspended.  
The coalition wants to keep this option on the table, for example for financing reconstruction efforts in the Ahr Valley, which was devastated by floods in 2021.
""The constitution expressly stipulates that credit ceilings can be raised to deal with natural disasters and extraordinary emergencies,"" said Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Next year, €2.7 billion in flood aid will be financed through loans.

Authorities expect uncertainties and potential emergencies in connection with Ukraine. So far, €8 billion has been earmarked for direct aid in 2024, to be paid though the regular budget. But what would happen if the US — Ukraine's biggest financier — were to cease supporting the embattled country?
Speaking at a SPD party conference, Chancellor Scholz said a ""major"" financial challenge would arise ""when others struggle."" He said Germany would have to reach decisions to be able to handle such a situation. By this, he was referring to suspending the debt brake — a move the liberal FDP opposes.
FDP Finance Minister Christian Lindner appears, however, to have relented over Ukraine, saying that ""if the situation changes and the international community reaches joint decisions, we are fully capable of acting, including when options provided by the federal budget are exceeded.""
Flood reconstruction efforts and Ukraine assistance aside, next year's budget will entail cuts in many different areas. The climate and transformation fund now lacks €12.7 billion, funds which had already been earmarked for various projects, including overhauling Deutsche Bahn's rail network. This will now be paid for through the sale of German state-held shares. Deutsche Bahn itself wants to sell its freight forwarding subsidiary Schenker.
Subsidies for the solar industry, for installing climate-neutral heating systems and purchasing electric cars will be cut too, even though they were supposed to remain in place until the end of 2024. ""That pains me, but it's the price for keeping the central components, the pillars of the climate and transformation fund intact,"" said Economic Minister Robert Habeck of the Greens.
""We are reducing climate-damaging subsidies to the tune of €3 billion,"" said Finance Minister Lindner. So far, the German state paid €1.4 billion due to the EU's so-called plastic levy, yet going forward, companies that put plastic into circulation will be forced to foot the bill.
In addition, the CO2 levy for burning fuel, heating oil or gas will be raised sooner than planned. The price currently stands at €30 per ton but is set to rise to €45 in 2024, instead of €40 as previously planned. Petrol will become about 4.5 cents more expensive per liter. This is expected to grow government revenue by about €1 billion.
According to Finance Minister Lindner, an extra €1.5 billion will be saved by reducing social welfare spending. Efforts will be made, for example, to quickly integrate Ukrainian refugees into the German labor market. 
Friedrich Merz, chairman of the opposition CDU/CSU parliamentary group in the Bundestag, sharply criticized the government's budget announcement, calling it ""financial policy trickery, that's all it is."" He said it had squared the circle attempting to satisfy all coalition parties' wants. Merz thinks the government will run out of money with the planned budget.
Merz said in light of the ""dramatic"" developments in Ukraine, an emergency ought be declared by the middle of next year at the latest. Adding that political stability was declining as the military threat increases.
The government's 2024 budget has also been criticized by the business community. There are fears a higher CO2 tax will drive up prices.

https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-coalition-government-agrees-on-2024-budget/a-67707922,POLITICS,Germany's coalition government agrees on 2024 budget 13.12.2023,"Germany's ruling center-left coalition has managed to strike a political deal on the federal budget for 2024, government sources said on Wednesday.  
The agreement comes after a court ruling threw government finances into disarray and exposed deep rifts between the three governing parties.

Germany's constitutional court ruled on November 15 that the coalition government's decision to reallocate €60 billion ($64.69 billion) of unused debt from the COVID-19 pandemic era to its climate and transformation fund was unconstitutional.
The ruling limited the government's ability to set up and draw money from off-budget special funds to circumvent the constitutional ""debt brake,"" which restricts the annual public deficit to 0.35% of Germany's total economic output.

It blew a big hole in public finances. For the 2024 budget, the government has had to find an additional €17 billion ($18.3 billion) to fill the hole. 
The court ruling also raised tensions in Scholz's already fractious three-way coalition, which is made up of the Social Democrats (SPD), the environmentalist Greens and the business-focused Free Democrats (FDP).  
The three parties often have contradictory priorities and they have suggested different measures to resolve the budget crisis.
While the SPD and the Greens sound in favor of increasing taxes, the FDP has ruled out tax hikes and instead suggested welfare cuts.  
The SPD and the Greens are staunchly against any cuts to social benefits; they instead want to suspend the debt brake again for 2024 to allow for increased government borrowing. But the FDP opposes this move. 
Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Economy Minister Robert Habeck and Finance Minister Christian Lindner presented the details of the deal on Wednesday. 
Scholz said the government will reinstate the debt brake in 2024. ""We will keep to the debt rule... in budget 2024,"" said the chancellor.
""The government is sticking to its targets,"" he said, adding that there will be cuts and savings, as the government will have to make do with less money following the constitutional court ruling.
Scholz also stressed that the climate and transformation fund will remain a key instrument for the climate-friendly transformation of the German economy. But the fund will be cut by €12 billion for 2024, he said.

Addressing the Bundestag on Wednesday, Scholz said: ""We have agreed to prioritize spending without putting the social security of our country or its transformation at risk. The Federal Ministry of Finance will now quickly implement these political compromises and provide the Bundestag with all appropriate formultions.""
Scholz said of negotiations: ""It was hard, but constructive. In the end, we got a good, truly democratic compromise.""
Habeck said the ruling coalition agreed to end financial incentives to buy electric cars sooner than previously planned, without revealing the exact date for when they would expire.
He also said that subsidies for the expansion of solar power will be cut.
There will also be changes to how the renovation of the country’s rail network will be financed.
Lindner said the Deutsche Bahn, the state-owned national rail operator, should benefit from privatization proceeds. Deutsche Bahn wants to sell its subsidiary Schenker.
Lindner also noted that the government will slash climate-damaging subsidies to the tune of €3 billion.
The three coalition parties vowed to continue German support for Ukraine.
Lindner said Berlin plans to provide direct bilateral assistance worth €8 billion to the war-ravaged country next year. ""We will continue to shoulder this responsibility,"" said the finance minister.
Scholz stressed Germany would have to react should the Ukraine conflict worsen next year.
If the situation worsens, for instance, due to other supporters cutting back their aid to Ukraine or a further increase in threat levels faced by Germany and Europe, ""we will have to react to this,"" he said.
The chancellor said he expects the Cabinet to give its approval to the budget agreement as early as possible.

Despite the coalition's deal on a draft budget, it's not clear if there will be enough time for the lower house of the German parliament, the Bundestag, to approve it before the end of the year.
The failure to finalize a 2024 budget will result in the government starting next year with a provisional budget.
That means government expenditure will continue and essential services like social benefits, salaries and pensions will be paid out.  
But other spending like industrial subsidies will be frozen.  
Finance Minister Lindner will also get increased powers as he will have to authorize any new spending.

https://www.dw.com/en/british-mps-vote-in-favor-of-contentious-rwanda-asylum-plan/a-67701340,HUMAN RIGHTS,British MPs vote in favor of contentious Rwanda asylum plan 12.12.2023,"British lawmakers have voted in favor of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda — a policy that was seen as term-defining for Sunak's embattled government.
Members of Parliament voted 313 to 269 in favor of the bill, sending it on for further scrutiny.
""The British people should decide who gets to come to this country — not criminal gangs or foreign courts,"" Sunak said on social media after the controversial bill passed.
Despite the large majority held by Sunak's Conservatives, the plan that envisages sending asylum-seekers to Rwanda was opposed not only by the opposition but also by dozens of hard-liners within his own party.
Britain's climate minister, Graham Stuart, was even recalled to London from the COP28 summit in Dubai to ensure his vote.
The importance Sunak has attached to the policy could mean that its failure would bring about his downfall.
Ahead of the vote, Sunak took to social media to urge lawmakers to support what he called ""the toughest ever anti-illegal immigration legislation.""
""This bill will allow us to control who comes into this country — not criminal gangs or foreign courts,"" he wrote. ""To stop the boats, we need to back this bill.""
""Stop the boats"" — referring to the vessels carrying migrants attempting to cross the Channel to Britain from the European mainland — has been a frequent rallying cry by the Conservative government in recent years. More than 29,000 people have made the crossing this year, down from 46,000 in all of 2022.
The British premier also invited more than a dozen hard-line Conservative opponents of the plan to a breakfast meeting in his official residence at 10 Downing Street.
The newly-appointed minister for illegal migration, Michael Tomlinson, asserted that the bill would ""get through tonight,"" while saying he would ""engage constructively"" with critical lawmakers over their concerns about the policy.
Conservative hard-liners say the Rwanda policy does not ensure that people who arrive in the UK without permission can be deported, as it would allow them to challenge their expulsion in both UK courts and at the European Court of Human Rights.
Human rights groups, on the other hand, say not only that the plan is unworkable but that it is unethical to send asylum-seekers to a country more than 4,000 miles (6,500 kilometers) away without allowing them to ever return to the UK. In addition, the Supreme Court, in a ruling last month, said that Rwanda cannot be considered a safe country to send migrants, declaring the plan illegal.
Sacha Deshmukh, chief executive of Amnesty International UK, called the plan an ""outrageous attack on the very concept of universal human rights.""
Sunak says approval in Tuesday's vote in the House of Commons, the lower house of parliament, will revive the plan in a new guise that addresses the court's concerns as The Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill 2023.
The plan has drawn parallels with Australia's highly controversial system of offshore processing, which has been slammed by human rights bodies around the world.
Under the policy, hundreds of asylum-seekers from the UK would be sent to the East African country for processing and settlement.
Supporters of the idea, which has already cost the UK government 240 million British pounds (€278 million, $300 million) in payments to Rwanda, say it will deter people from making the hazardous sea journeys and put people-smuggling gangs out of business.
So far, not a single person has been sent to Rwanda under the plan.
As lawmakers debated the plan in Parliament, a refugee charity reported that an asylum-seeker had died on a barge housing migrants waiting for a decision on their applications. The death was seized upon by human rights groups as highlighting what they call inhumane conditions for asylum-seekers in the UK.

https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-film-festival-names-tricia-tuttle-as-new-director/a-67702011,FILM,Berlin Film Festival names Tricia Tuttle as new director 12.12.2023,"Tricia Tuttle has been appointed as the new director of the Berlin Film Festival. The official announcement was made on December 12 at a press conference chaired by Germany's Federal Commissioner for Culture and the Media, Claudia Roth.
Tuttle, who previously served as the head of festivals at the British Film Institute (BFI), will officially assume the directorship on April 1, 2024.
Tuttle was recommended by a selection committee made up of Oscar winner Edward Berger, actress Sara Fazilat, managing director of the German Film Academy Anne Leppin, producer Roman Paul, as well as Florian Graf, head of the Berlin senate chancellery, and Claudia Roth.
She led the BFI's London Film Festival for five editions up until 2022, and currently serves as head of directing fiction at the UK's National Film and TV School.
""Tricia Tuttle brings 25 years of film and film festival experience with her. Under her leadership, the BFI London Film Festival has not only seen an increase in audience numbers, but has also gained in international profile and significance,"" said Claudia Roth at the press conference. ""She has developed creative strategies to meet the challenges of digitalization and made the festival more colorful, diverse and accessible.""
The newly appointed director also expressed her enthusiasm for the film festival held every year in the German capital: ""I have attended the Berlinale for many years as a professional and have really come to appreciate it very much. The Berlinale is a leader amongst A-list film festivals — welcoming and inclusive, and brimming with a breath-taking diversity of films,"" said Tuttle. 
""It's a festival that shows cinema as a most vibrant, often magical artform, one which can transform how we see the world and how we understand each other. What an immense thrill and privilege it is to have this opportunity to lead this important festival. I look forward to a very successful Berlinale in 2024, and to joining the team afterwards.""
Roth added that Tuttle had above all convinced the selection committee ""with her clear ideas on the artistic perspectives of the Berlinale, a modern, team-orientated festival management, sustainable support for young talent and contemporary sponsorship models.""
""I am extremely pleased that we were able to win Tricia Tuttle for the directorship of the Berlinale. She is the right choice to lead it into a successful future.""
Tuttle, who comes from North Carolina in the south of the United States, began her career playing music as a guitarist for the band June, signed to Beggars Banquet Records. She completed her bachelor studies at the University of North Carolina, and later obtained a Masters in Film Studies from the British Film Institute.  
She became deputy head of festivals and then festivals director at the British Film Institute, leading both the BFI London Film Festival and BFI Flare: London LGBTQIA+ Film Festival.
The press release of the German Ministry of State for Culture and the Media further notes that Tuttle expanded the BFI London Film Festival's reach by over 50%, notably by introducing screenings around the UK, increasing digital access to the events and establishing the ""LFF For Free"" program, which features free screenings and events.
She was included in Variety's annual International Women's Impact Report in 2019 as well as in the Variety500 ranking in 2022, an index of influential business leaders shaping the global media industry.
Tuttle takes over from the Berlinale's current leading duo, executive director Mariette Rissenbeek and artistic director Carlo Chatrian, who are both due to leave their position after the 2024 edition.
Rissenbeek and Chatrian had been at the helm of the festival since 2019.
While Rissenbeek had announced her departure as executive director last March, Chatrian had initially expressed his intention to stay on. He later confirmed his departure after Roth and the Media Supervisory Board of Federal Cultural Events in Berlin had announced that a single director would be taking over, replacing the previous joint management structure.
The ""conditions for me to continue as artistic director no longer exist,"" said Chatrian when he resigned.
The dual management structure had only been established with their appointment, which followed the retirement of longtime director Dieter Kosslick, who led the festival from 2001 to 2019.
Since then, the Berlinale had to deal with pandemic-related restrictions and the closure of many film venues in the area around Potsdamer Platz, which serves as the headquarters of the festival.
The way the changes were handled sparked some controversy. More than 300 film professionals had signed an open letter protesting the ""unprofessional"" treatment of Chatrian.
Along with changes in leadership, the Berlinale is undergoing other structural adjustments for the 2024 edition. The festival has announced that its program will feature approximately 200 films, down from 287 in 2023.
An entire section, called Perspektive Deutsches Kino, has been removed from the program. It showcased new German filmmakers, but their works will rather be integrated into existing sections.
Another independent sidebar, the Berlinale Series, will be included in the Berlinale Special Gala screenings.
The 74th Berlin International Film Festival takes place from February 15-25, 2024.

https://www.dw.com/en/espionage-germany-cases/a-66496986,POLITICS,Espionage in Germany: The most spectacular spy cases 12.12.2023,"The high-profile case of Carsten L.* goes to court this week.
He was responsible for ""personnel security"" as head of division at Germany's international secret service (BND), but he is suspected of being a security risk himself.
The former Bundeswehr officer now stands accused of having worked as a double agent for the FSB, Russia's secret service. L. is said to have passed on secret documents to the businessman Arthur E., who then handed them over to the FSB. L. is said to have been paid €450,000 ($484,000) and E. at least €400,000 for this. Prosecutors now suggest the betrayal of secrets could have enabled the Russian FSB to draw conclusions on Germany's espionage methods.
Carsten L. and his accomplice Arthur E. are now on trial in Berlin. They face a life sentence if they are convicted of particularly serious treason. 
The Russian war against Ukraine ""also means a turning point for internal security,"" German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said in June 2023, warning of a new wave of disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks, and espionage by foreign intelligence services.
At the beginning of August, there was another case in point.

Thomas H. was arrested on August 9 in the western city of Koblenz when the federal prosecutor's office accused the Bundeswehr officer of having betrayed information about military details to Russian intelligence.
The Berlin daily Tagesspiegel reported that Thomas H. had already come to the attention of his colleagues because of his sympathy for the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD). Some parts of the party are considered far-right extremists and very critical of the NATO alliance's attempts to help Ukraine against Russian aggression.
But it is not only since the Russian invasion of Ukraine that spies in Germany have been reporting to Moscow. Beginning sometime in the 1980s, two Russian agents led a middle-class life under the names of Andreas and Heidrun Anschlag, he posing as an engineer, she as a housewife.
They spied on NATO and the European Union, first for the Soviet Union and then for the Russian secret service. They received their orders via encrypted radio messages on shortwave at a time when espionage was not yet a predominantly digital business. It was not until 2011 that their cover was blown — probably thanks to a tip-off from US intelligence services. In 2013, they were sentenced to several years in prison and eventually deported to Russia.
The communist German Democratic Republic (GDR) referred to their agents as ""scouts of peace."" An estimated 12,000 of them are believed to have been deployed by the East German secret service, the Staatssicherheitsdienst or Stasi, to West Germany during the Cold War.
Among them was Gabriele Gast, a West German recruited by a Stasi officer in 1968 while on a research trip to East Germany for her dissertation entitled: ""The Political Role of Women in the GDR."" From then on, Gast reported to the intelligence service in East Germany — while also making a career for herself at the Western intelligence service BND under a false name. She was only exposed after the collapse of the GDR in 1989, shortly before the reunification of Germany. She is still considered to have been one of the GDR's top spies in the West.
Alfred Spuhler may have been a similarly good source for the Stasi. As a high-ranking BND official, he unmasked hundreds of Western agents working in the GDR. He was arrested in November 1989.
Heinz Felfe, the longtime head of the BND's ""Counterintelligence Soviet Union"" unit, was also a double agent. He was a member of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler's police unit, Schutzstaffel (SS), then reported to the KGB in Moscow until 1961. Over the years, Felfe is believed to have worked for seven different intelligence services, including the British MI6.
Probably the most sensational espionage case from the Cold War period in Germany is that of Günter Guillaume.
Posing as refugees from East Germany, he and his wife Christel came to West Germany in 1956. Their mission was to provide the Stasi with internal information about the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). Guillaume worked his way up, eventually becoming personal advisor to Chancellor Willy Brandt when the SPD came to power.
When Guillaume's cover was blown, Brandt was forced to resign as chancellor on May 6, 1974. Guillaume was sentenced to 13 years in prison and his wife to eight years. Both were released in 1981 in exchange for West German agents.
A vast number of Stasi spies were exposed after the fall of the Wall. Not much is known about Western agents in the GDR, with the notable exception of Elli Barczatis and Karl Laurenz, who smuggled GDR documents to the West at the beginning of the Cold War in the early 1950s.
Barczatis worked as chief secretary to GDR Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl. She obtained rather banal government papers that she passed to her lover Karl Laurenz, who handed them over to West German authorities. When this was discovered, both Barczatis and Laurenz were sentenced to death in East Germany and executed by guillotine in 1955.

https://www.dw.com/en/rina-gonoi-japan-soldiers-found-guilty-of-sexual-assault/a-67697008,LAW AND JUSTICE,Rina Gonoi: Japan soldiers found guilty of sexual assault 12.12.2023,"A court in Japan on Tuesday found three former soldiers guilty of sexually assaulting a female colleague and gave them suspended jail terms.
The case of 24-year-old Rina Gonoi relates to a 2021 incident during her time in the army.
After joining the Japanese Self Defense Forces in 2020, she said she experienced daily harassment.
""When walking down the hallway, someone slaps you on your hip, or holds you from behind,"" she told AFP. ""I was kissed on the cheek, and my breasts were grabbed.""
And then in 2021, during a drill, she said three of her colleagues pinned her to the ground, forced her legs apart and pressed their crotches against her in simulation of a sex act. She said other colleagues present at the time watched and laughed.
Even though she complained to her superiors at the time, no action was taken, prompting Gonoi to leave the military.
In 2022, Gonoi took to YouTube to share her account.
After she went public, Japan's Defense Ministry issued a public apology to her and announced that five men connected to the incident had been dismissed and four others punished.
Gonoi's decision to go public also grabbed public attention and put a spotlight on the issue of sexual assault and harassment in a society where women rarely hold positions in the upper echelons of politics, business and military.
It also inspired others to file complaints about sexual harassment and bullying.
In the military, for instance, over 1,400 women and men have submitted their allegations following a special inspection by the Defense Ministry.
This June, Japan passed legislation redefining rape, including removing the requirement that victims prove they had sought to resist their attacker.

Gonoi's battle has even attracted international recognition: Time Magazine named her on its list of 100 emerging world leaders while the British Broadcasting Corp included her among its 100 most influential women globally.
But she has also been a target of online vitriol.
""I have gotten many derogatory comments. But I know the world values what I'm doing,"" she told Reuters.
Separately, Gonoi has lodged a civil case against her former peers and the government, seeking damages for the alleged assault and the subsequent inaction despite her complaints.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-road-deaths-expected-to-fall-in-2023/a-67690589,CARS AND TRANSPORTATION,Germany: Road deaths expected to fall in 2023 11.12.2023,"The number of people dying in accidents on Germany's roads looked set to once again fall in 2023, according to data from Germany's national statistics agency, Destatis, published on Monday.
The country saw a historic low in road deaths in 2021 when there were just 2,562 fatalities.
According to estimates based on data from January to September, the number of people expected to die in road traffic accidents was expected to fall in 2023 from the level in 2022.
Destatis estimated that the total number of road deaths in 2023 would reach 2,750 for the year, 40 fewer than the previous year.
The figure is above the historic low of 2,562 in 2021, but well below the pre-pandemic level of 3,062.
Traffic on the roads has generally decreased since the COVID-19 lockdown, accident researcher Siegfried Brockmann told the DPA news agency.
This, he said, was because many more people were avoiding commutes by working from home and with video conferences replacing much business travel.
About 360,000 were expected to be injured in road accidents this year, roughly the same as in 2022.
However, Destatis forecast more than 2.5 million crashes and accidents on German roads for the first time since 2019 — about 4% more than in 2022.
Destatis figures show a dramatic reduction in the number of road deaths over the past decades.
The agency has been recording road accidents since as long ago as 1952, including both West Germany and the former East Germany.
By the mid-50s, the number of annual road deaths stood at around 14,000, before spiking in 1970 at 21,000.
Since then, the number of road deaths has sunk dramatically, thanks in no small part to changes in the law.
New legislation lowered speed limits on some roads and made it compulsory for drivers to wear seatbelts and motorcyclists to wear helmets. The law was also altered to bring down the legal limit for blood-alcohol content while driving.
Technical safety specifications in vehicles have also dramatically improved throughout the same period.

https://www.dw.com/en/deutsche-bahn-bosses-pick-up-bonuses-as-passengers-suffer/a-67691505,BUSINESS,Deutsche Bahn bosses pick up bonuses as passengers suffer 11.12.2023,"In the wake of the GDL railroad union's most recent strike for better wages and working conditions, a report has emerged claiming that the top management of Germany's rail operator, Deutsche Bahn, will apparently receive bonuses totaling almost €5 million ($5.4 million) for 2022.
This was divulged on Monday by public broadcasters NDR, WDR and daily Süddeutsche Zeitung who said they had access to Deutsche Bahn's long-term calculation model for bonuses.
Bonuses are meant to be an award for good performance. But many long-suffering rail customers will be scratching their heads in amazement and wondering how that's possible, given Deutsche Bahn's long list of problems.
The trick, it appears, is to offset areas in which targets have been missed against other areas in which targets have been exceeded. It means the basic salaries of the nine members of the executive will rise from a total of around €4 million to around €9 million in 2022.
According to the report, Deutsche Bahn only slightly exceeded its own targets in the area of ""women in leadership and employee satisfaction"" in 2022. However, the bonus was up by 175%, says the report. The executive board members stand to rake in around €1.6 million for this target alone.
The documents also show that Deutsche Bahn exceeded its self-imposed target for CO2 savings by 2%, the investigative network reported. CEO Richard Lutz, for example, is said to have received almost €440,000 in bonus payments.
According to the report, the bonus system looks set to be revamped next year. Deutsche Bahn board members would then receive a higher proportion of their salary as a fixed salary, while the proportion of bonuses would be reduced.
Deutsche Bahn's supervisory board, which includes federal government and trade union representatives, sets the parameters of the bonus system.
A number of rail lines around Bavaria's state capital, Munich, were closed during the heavy onset of winter. In Ulm and Munich, stranded passengers spent Friday night in trains, with the Munich Central Station inaccessible for hours. National rail provider Deutsche Bahn said delays would last into Monday.










In future, meeting targets will have less relevance for the rail bosses' salaries. Whether a train is running late, is canceled or overbooked will also have less of an impact. Other problems like trains stopping ""indefinitely"" mid-route, air conditioning systems failing in midsummer or the app failing to show alternatives and delays will play less of a role in determining their salaries.
Germany's national train system has a lot of room for improvement, not least concerning the punctuality of long-distance trains. Last year, every third train was more than six minutes late. The situation was better on regional services, where just under a tenth of regional trains failed to reach their destination on time.
The issue of trains not running on time is a major grievance for passengers. Factoring in delays means they must adapt their travel plans accordingly to avoid missing connecting trains or appointments. That puts off a lot of potential passengers, at a time when Deutsche Bahn needs to find ways of squaring the circle to attract more customers and increase train freight volume if it wants to achieve its climate targets by 2030.
""Today's unpunctuality is the result of 20 years of misguided transport and rail policy,"" said Christian Böttger, professor of industrial engineering at the Berlin University of Applied Sciences. In the last 20 years, investment in rail infrastructure has been cut back, while at the same time more trains have been running.
""The network is simply overloaded,"" said Böttger. In contrast to Luxembourg and Switzerland, which invested around €575 per capita and €450 per capita in rail infrastructure respectively, the figure in Germany is just €114.
For the majority of Germans, mobility means traveling by car, and that guides politicians' policies.
In addition, for the past 15 years Deutsche Bahn has steadfastly maintained that its rail network infrastructure is in good working order. A recent report, however, struck a different tone, observing that the network was ""old"" and ""prone to faults.""
""That's a huge scandal,"" said Böttger. ""The federal government has spent millions to check these figures again and has always confirmed that the network is in a great condition.""
He points out that there is no inquiry committee and that no one is asking whether the management and supervisory boards should be held accountable.
In an effort to improve its image, Deutsche Bahn is planning a refurbishment program worth billions of euros, with the aim of restoring heavily used sections of the rail network. Ultimately, Deutsche Bahn wants to have a high-performance network in place by 2030. This would involve improving 40 routes to ensure more reliability and a higher frequency of trains.
""We are now facing a historic turning point,"" said Pro-Rail Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy organization for the improvement of rail transport. The government coalition in Berlin wants to significantly increase investment in rail infrastructure in the budget for 2024.
""There is significantly more money than before; that is the good news,"" said Böttger. However, a large part of this money is needed to mitigate the impact of high inflation, he added.
In addition, the government had promised an extra €45 billion by 2027 ""and now only around half is being provided by the federal government from the budget and climate protection fund,"" said Böttger.

The money will be used to renovate the high-speed railway lines, but will not be enough to build new lines. Böttger does not expect these measures to improve punctuality, as they don't tackle the basic problem of overloaded networks.
The government has earmarked €90 billion as a priority to build new lines. In addition, a further €50 billion are needed for the so-called Deutschlandtakt, a project that would connect Germany's major cities with trains running at least every hour. Another €30 billion would have to be pumped into freight transport, which has long been running a deficit.
""But there is no overview of the actual figures,"" said Böttger. ""And I don't think the government wants there to be an overview either, because the result would be somewhat embarrassing, as it would show that the political goals are not financially viable.""
To make matters worse, there are not enough planners and construction companies to carry out the refurbishment work, he added.
For years, experts have recommended splitting up Deutsche Bahn so that the rail network and operations are managed by different companies.
However, Transport Minister Volker Wissing, of the neoliberal Free Democrats, is not impressed by the idea. He's planning a new infrastructure company which would focus on the maintenance and expansion of the rail network separately from rail operations. This company is due to start work on January 1, 2024.
Other countries, such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and the UK, have found a way to make the separation of network and operations work. ""But it's not a magic solution,"" cautioned Böttger.
Rail customers should not expect an improvement in rail travel anytime soon. On the contrary, things will get worse before they get better, as busy routes will have to be shut down completely at times for maintenance and refurbishment.
""In view of the list of problems and the visible solutions, I doubt that the railroad's accumulated problems can really be resolved in the next 10 years,"" said Böttger.

https://www.dw.com/en/green-light-for-investors-in-german-football/a-67690770,SOCCER,Green light for investors in German football 11.12.2023,"At a meeting of the German Football League (DFL) on December 11, German football clubs voted in a plan to secure private equity investment in return for a share of TV rights over the next two decades. Of the 36 clubs in the top two divisions, 24 voted in favor, achieving the required two-third majority by just one vote. Ten voted against, while two abstained in the secret ballot.
DFL managing director Steffen Merkel said the outcome showed ""German football is ready to invest in the future.""
Bayern Munich CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen said ""we've got the result that we wished for in order to develop the league.""
The deal envisages the selling of six to nine per cent of the shares in a DFL subsidiary, to which all media rights are outsourced, for 20 years, at the cost of somewhere between €800 million and €1 billion.
With the entry of an investor, the DFL wants to further develop its business model and improve the international marketing of the top two leagues, including the creation of a streaming platform. According to reports, there is a broad consensus among the clubs that this is the right approach, but the clubs and the DFL are less united on the question of whether an investor should be brought in to achieve this.
Six months after the first attempt to bring on an investor failed, the door has now been opened to the kind of investment that German football has not seen before. After all, German football has proudly built a reputation for itself through its fan commitment and by restricting the degree of influence external investors can have on the club through the 50+1 rule, which requires clubs have at least 50 percent plus one vote ownership of the club, thereby ensuring members have control over major club decisions.
Indeed, the weekend before the meeting, Bundesliga stadiums across the country saw fan protests against the arrival of investors. Recently, fan alliance ""Unser Kurve"" complained the process was rushed and lacked ""sensible, transparent and in-depth discussion.""
Critics are concerned that the so-called ""red lines"" promised by the two DFL managing directors Marc Lenz and Steffen Merkel will not be kept, with investors potentially exerting indirect influence. According to the DFL though, the investor should have no influence on the organisation of kick-off times, should not be able to move matches abroad against the will of the clubs or introduce play-offs in the Bundesliga.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-chancellor-olaf-scholz-gets-backing-from-his-spd/a-67689562,POLITICS,German Chancellor Olaf Scholz gets backing from his SPD 11.12.2023,"The mood was grim when 600 delegates from Germany's center-left Social Democrats (SPD) headed to Berlin for their national party conference last weekend. Although the SPD won over 26% in the previous general election in 2021 and has since led the federal government, new polls suggest that if national elections were held now, the party would receive just 14% of the vote.  
Four out of five eligible voters say they are dissatisfied specifically with the work of Chancellor Olaf Scholz. That is an all-time low for a German head of government. 
""The house is burning, and people are losing faith in us,"" Philipp Türmer, who leads Jusos, the SPD's youth wing, told delegates. 

Crisis after crisis has hit Germany since the SPD took over government two years ago, with the support of the Greens and business-first Free Democrats (FDP). The latest one: a decision by the Constitutional Court ruling the government's budget partially unconstitutional. In 2024, that leaves a shortfall of €17 billion ($18.3 billion), according to a government estimate. 
There is internal disagreement about how to plug that hole. The SPD and Greens want to declare a national emergency, allowing them to suspend constitutional debt rules and borrow more money. The FDP is against that. 
Finding a solution is a ""very difficult task,"" Scholz told party conference delegates. ""Especially when you can't just do it the way you think is right, but also need the agreement of others."" 
He insisted, however, that the governing coalition would find a solution, one that would not lead to the ""dismantling"" of the social welfare state that the FDP has been pushing for. 
The chancellor is not known as a compelling orator. He usually reads his speeches, his voice monotonous. Not for nothing is he nicknamed the ""Scholzomat"" on account of his robotic style of delivery. Pointing to his seemingly unshakable self-confidence, critics say he comes across as condescending, especially when he is defensive.
But at the weekend conference, Scholz's 51-minute address was met with standing ovations from the party delegates.
Given the budget woes, there are new calls to ""modernize"" the so-called debt brake, which strictly regulates how much the German state can borrow. Proponents of constitutional reform fear that the spending restrictions are limiting Germany's ability to make much-needed investments. 
""China, the US, South Korea, India — the world's largest economies are investing massively in climate-neutral technologies and digitalization,"" Lars Klingbeil, the party's co-chair, said. ""It's about jobs and innovation, prosperity and security. The future of this country is a state that invests, that protects, that provides security in these turbulent times."" 
Jusos tried to push through a conference vote to do away with the debt brake altogether. That failed, but they did manage to get an agreement on suspending it for 2024, with designs to reform it thereafter. 
One area of imperiled policy at the federal level is Germany's support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia's full-scale invasion. Scholz promised that the billions Germany pledged would be there but recognized that a prolonged war means doing ""what is necessary for a long time."" 
In the United States, too, money for Ukraine is running into the friction of domestic politics. Scholz said that the future of bipartisan support for Ukraine is hardly assured, which means Germany must be ""in a position"" to step up even more. 
Part of Scholz's address to delegates focused on the renewed rise of right-wing populism — in Germany and around Europe. He blamed socioeconomic upheaval that has left many uncertain about ""whether it would turn out well for them and their families."" 
In Germany, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is seeing record success in polls. In some states, they are the most favored party, even as domestic intelligence has designated parts of the AfD as far-right threats to German democracy. 
At the same time, the AfD's anti-migrant and xenophobic positioning has been amplified by other parties, including the SPD. Scholz has recently come out in favor of faster deportations of asylum seekers.  
Despite the ongoing political malaise with no clear solution, the party conference organizers felt they had achieved their goal of showing a sense of solidarity.  
""The SPD won the election with unity and confidence,"" said Saskia Esken, the party's other co-leader, referring to the 2021 vote. 
Her counterpart, Klingbeil, acknowledged that the ""task is huge. But I am firmly convinced that there is no other political force that can achieve all of this.""

https://www.dw.com/en/japan-unpacking-the-nuances-of-the-traditional-bow/a-67687741,CULTURE,Japan: Unpacking the nuances of the traditional bow 11.12.2023,"To the Japanese, the bow is something they do every day. Children bow to their teacher and say ""ohayou gozaimasu,"" or ""good morning,"" at the start of every school day. It would be unthinkable for a business meeting to commence without formal bows.
Shop staff and train conductors, hotel employees, janitors and deliverymen all bow to their customers. Even passing a colleague in a corridor will inevitably elicit eye contact and a deep nod.
It's a greeting, and it's polite. But a bow to a Japanese person imparts much more information, with each variety having a nuance that communicates a slightly different meaning.
""Bowing is a key part of greetings in Japan,"" said Kiyomoto Ogasawara, the heir to the 32nd headmastership of the Ogasawara-ryu school of ""reiho,"" or etiquette.
""Bowing signifies trust and peace by showing vulnerability, as we avert our eyes and expose the head,"" explained Ogasawara, whose family has served as instructors to generations of shoguns since the school was established more than 830 years ago.
Alongside ""reiho,"" Ogasawara-ryu masters teach the disciplines of archery and mounted archery, an important military skill as well as a religious ritual at Shinto shrines since ancient times.

And while etiquette and archery may not appear to be compatible skills, Ogasawara said incorporating proper etiquette into a person's daily life is required to attain the strong legs and perfect posture needed to have both hands free to fire a bow from a galloping horse.
And that's why, historically, warriors and the elite in society were taught that posture and etiquette are of such importance.
It's widely believed that bowing became the accepted greeting as far back as the Asuka period, between 593 A.D. and 710 A.D. Buddhism was arriving in Japan from mainland Asia and there were shifts in the nascent nation's artistic, social and political mores.
In the Buddhist faith, bowing was — and remains — an important gesture of respect and piety, and it was soon adopted to indicate similar reverence for the elite in Japan's strictly hierarchical society.
And while the samurai no longer rule Japan, the bow has endured as the mark of respect. And failing to perform an adequate bow can still be perceived as a slight, particularly among older, more traditional Japanese.
Today, the bow is the time-honored greeting in Japan, but it's also used to communicate farewell, the start or end of a class, meeting or ceremony and to express gratitude. The bow is also used as an apology, to accompany a request or show sympathy or appreciation. It is deployed when a person is worshipping or at the outset of formal ceremony, and is a critical element of martial arts.
There are three main types of bow in the Japanese business world, but each starts from the same position: straight back, legs straight and firmly planted to avoid slouching. The bow should then be performed in time with one's breathing.
Bending forward from the waist should take one inhalation of breath. That position is then sustained for the time it takes to exhale and then the person performing the bow inhales again as he or she returns to an upright position.
The ""eshaku"" bow is a relatively casual greeting, exchanged between people of the same status or when formalities are not as important, and only requires leaning forward to an angle of 15 degrees for a few seconds.
Japan's national sport can now be enjoyed along with a meal. The Yokozuna Tonkatsu Dosukoi Tanaka restaurant opened its doors in Tokyo in 2022, as a place for former sumo wrestlers to demonstrate the traditional art. The concept has been met with great enthusiasm from diners.







The ""keirei"" bow is the most common variant in the Japanese business world, and requires the person to lean at an angle of 30 degrees and look at the ground about 1 meter (about 3 feet) in front of their toes.
A ""keirei"" bow is used to greet clients, join a meeting or during interactions with superiors.
The ""saikeirei"" indicates the greatest respect to the recipient and requires a bow from the waist of as much as 70 degrees and sustained for several seconds to emphasize respect and sincerity. The ""saikeirei"" is deployed to greet a very important person, such as a member of the imperial family, to express deep regret or ask for a significant favor.
Men performing these bows are expected to keep their arms rigid alongside their legs, while women often place one hand atop the other in front of the abdomen.
Bows performed in the seated position are known as ""zarei"" and usually take place on traditional tatami mat floors during traditional occasions, such as the tea ceremony or martial arts tournaments.
All seated bows start from the ""seiza"" seated posture, with the legs tucked directly below and with the toes pointing straight behind. The person sits on their calves with the elbows pointed slightly out and with the palms of the hands on the top of the thighs.
This position can be uncomfortable for non-Japanese, especially if it has to be sustained for a long time, but Japanese will appreciate good posture.
The ""saikeirei"" bow starts at the ""seiza"" position and requires the person to lean forward until their chest is on their lap. Simultaneously, the hands slide forward along the thighs until they are on the tatami floor in front of the knees.
The final position will see the person's face around 5 centimeters (2 inches) from the floor, and the palms of the hands making a triangle on the floor.
The ""futsurei"" is a less formal variety of the same bow and only requires the person to dip their body until their head is around 30 centimeters from the floor. The ""senrei"" is even more relaxed and only requires the person to bow about 30 degrees from the waist and have the tips of their fingers on the tatami.
Another, far more rare bow, is the ""dogeza,"" which requires the person to get on their hands and knees and place their face on the ground — and was in the past used when a person was begging for their life after somehow offending a powerful superior.










Matthew Strecher, a professor of Japanese literature at Sophia University in Tokyo, was given lessons in etiquette when he first arrived in Japan in the 1980s. Emphasis was placed on a proper bow and ""not just ducking my head briefly,"" he said.
""Some latitude is given to foreign people when they try to bow and I think Japanese are even quite amused as they watch us try to get it right, but I do think they appreciate the effort,"" he said. ""In the same way, they do not appreciate it when we flout expectations and make no effort at what is quite a special moment.""
After more than three decades in Japan, Strecher said he knows when a less formal nod to a colleague in passing is adequate and occasions when a greater expression of gratitude or respect is required.
""If I am saying goodbye, then it is important to bow properly because failing to do that would not be appreciated, and in a business setting we are expected to do the right thing because it is about ensuring the harmony of the workplace,"" he added.
Kiyomoto Ogasawara said younger generations of Japanese do not grasp the exact meaning of Japan's most important form of unspoken communication.
""Actually, the subtle meanings of different bows are less known nowadays, even in Japan,"" he admitted. ""While they were traditionally learned in the home, I believe that anyone can grasp these nuances, with some studying,"" he told DW.
""Bowing reflects our cultural identity, so it is vital for understanding our roots and sharing them with others,"" he added.
""It is part of our culture, influenced by many factors, such as our history and environment. Recognizing and using different forms of bowing is very valuable.""

https://www.dw.com/en/kenya-in-search-of-harmony-60-years-after-independence/a-67676795,BUSINESS,Kenya in search of harmony 60 years after independence 10.12.2023,"A glare full of determination, right hand resting on his rifle: The statue of iconic freedom fighter Dedan Kimathi (pictured above) is hard to miss for anyone walking through the center of Nairobi, Kenya's capital.
The history of Kenya and its struggle for independence from its British colonizers are woven into the fabric of Nairobi. The statue of Kimathi gazes down Kimathi Street towards Kenyatta Avenue, named for Jomo Kenyatta, who led Kenya toward independence and was its first president. 
The country was given a new start when Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II, formally handed over power on December 12, 1963, thereafter known as Jamhuri Day — ""Jamhuri"" being the Swahili word for ""Republic.""
Sixty years on, not everyone is in the mood for celebration. Berline Ndolo is the founder and program manager of the World Network for Sustainable Change, a nongovernmental organization based in Kisumu, western Kenya that helps vulnerable people with education and agriculture projects. In her role, she interacts daily with, as she puts it, ""the poorest of the poor.""
""This particular group of people cannot be happy on Jamhuri Day. Because of the high cost of living right now, where life has become very expensive for them, they cannot even afford three meals a day, maybe not even two,"" Ndolo told DW. ""They'll focus on how best they can feed their family with their very few resources.""
""High cost of living"" is a common phrase across Kenya these days. With President William Ruto, now one year in office, cutting subsidies and introducing new taxes, the situation has gone from bad to worse.
""The president had a very promising agenda for the people of Kenya,"" said Ndolo. ""The people who voted for him were very hopeful.""
Now, she said, nothing seems to be changing. ""If anything, businesses are closing, people who are in employment are really heavily taxed, and still, we're struggling to make ends meet.""
Kenya's recent history has been defined by the post-election crisis in 2007 and early 2008. A narrow but contested victory of incumbent Mwai Kibaki, an ethnic Kikuyu, over Raila Odinga, of the Luo community, sparked violent clashes that left up to 1,500 people dead. Peter Muchiri, 26, who works at a hotel in the central Kenyan town of Nyahururu, described the crisis as a wake-up call for the nation.
""That was the turning point,"" said Muchiri. ""Normally, there were towns and places where you couldn't go to look for a job or ask for help because if you're not one of them, no one cares about you.""
Muchiri was 11 years old when the violence broke out. Nyahururu was one of the towns considered safe at the time.
""The country was in a big mess,"" Muchiri said. ""People learned a lot from that.""
He feels the ethnic divisions have reduced since. ""It doesn't matter which tribe you are from. You are Kenyan.""
James Shikwati, founder of the Inter Region Economic Network, argues that Ruto has one significant achievement. ""He made the Kenyan campaign not largely reliant on ethnic community, to point and say this tribe, that tribe,"" Shikwati said.
While campaigning in 2022, Ruto styled himself as the ""hustler"" who struggled to make a living, sympathized with the poor and promised to lift them out of poverty.
""By creating the new 'hustler' tribe, meaning the people at the bottom tribe, if we use such a loose term, I think he did a good job in that,"" said Shikwati. In doing so, Ruto sensitized Kenyans to rethink their country's configuration, he added.
According to Shikwati, this also meant a paradigmatic shift in how Kenyans now view Ruto's presidency. He's being ""scrutinized harshly,"" but not from an ethnic point of view.
""They are not labeling him in the name of his tribe,"" he said. ""They're simply focusing on the economy. They're saying it's not doing well, people are losing their jobs, companies are closing down.""
When Ruto's policies caused prices to increase, many Kenyans took to the streets. The massive and sometimes violent protests were spurred by Raila Odinga, a former Kenyan prime minister who refused to accept his defeat after finishing second in the 2022 presidential election. The demonstrations have since ceased, but the economic hardship remains.
Samir Hassan is a father of four and a driver in Mombasa, Kenya's second-largest city. His itinerary regularly leads him to the western edges of the city where the Standard Gauge Railway links the Kenyan coast to the capital. The Chinese-built train delivers tourists three times a day, but with many experiencing economic hardship, the tourists are no longer arriving.
""Now every Kenyan is cutting the costs,"" Hassan told DW. ""Normally, we're very busy in December because it's where people rest and it's where we get mixed clients: foreigners and our local tourists.

""It's a chain of life. There are people who depend on selling their coconuts to tourists. There are people like us drivers who depend on the transfers to feed their children. So they've really cut up that chain because it's one relying on the other.""
Down Kenyatta Avenue, just west of Nairobi's city center, is Uhuru Park. The historic area was the site of many fights for democratization in the 1990s. The park, which will host a festival for the 60th Jamhuri Day, lies just beyond the Nairobi Expressway.
Built on stilts, the capital's main arterial road stands out. It links the city center with the airport — and to Nairobi's rail terminals. While the railway, which can take you to Mombasa in just over five hours, was inaugurated in 2017, the expressway only opened last year.
The two crucial infrastructure projects cost billions, and according to economist Shikwati, they account for much of the hardship Kenyans are enduring these days.
It all points back to the aftermath of the 2007 post-electoral crisis. Both Ruto and Uhuru Kenyatta, the son of Kenya's first president, were charged before the International Criminal Court for their roles in the crisis. To escape what they called a ""colonial"" justice, they teamed up for president in 2012 — and won, with Kenyatta becoming president and Ruto vice president.
""That must have put a lot of pressure on them that they have to endear themselves to the Kenyan populace,"" said Shikwati. ""This meant they had to showcase success, and showcasing success means projects, big projects, including the famous Standard Gauge Railway. And that means you borrow money to deliver within a short period because you have only five years before another campaign comes in.""
That was the beginning of a spiral of loans and a rapidly growing mountain of debt. According to Shikwati, bias in the global financial system and misjudgments by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund also played their part.
But Ruto's decisions as president, whether ending subsidies and introducing new taxes, certainly did not make the fiscal crisis better.
""Our economy is more or less like what we in Kenya call hawkers — the people who carry things and sell on the street. So I would say it's like a hawking economy. You buy things from China, you sell to Kenyans,"" explained Shikwati.
""You can have a big shop. You are considered to be an SME [small to mid-sized business]. But unlike Germany, you don't produce the screws, you don't produce windshields. You're more like a conveyor belt, moving from one spot to the other,"" he said.
Following that logic, imposing high taxes on an economy that was not productive left few options but to reduce activities and close down companies, putting even more strain on the population.
It turns out that 60 years after independence, ethnic polarization is no longer the defining factor of Kenyan society. Now, it's economic hardship that's challenging the country's future.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-retailers-report-weak-christmas-season-sales/a-67682333,SOCIETY,German retailers report weak Christmas season sales 10.12.2023,"German retailers on Sunday said sales ahead of Christmas had been disappointing, with a ""noticeable"" lack of momentum in the first weeks of Advent.
Although sales figures are up on the previous year, the volume of sales showed a marked dip in real terms because of rising inflation.
From more than 350 retail companies that were surveyed, some 60% expressed dissatisfaction with the latest trend in sales, the German Retail Association (HDE) said.
""The second week of Advent was noticeably weaker in the retail sector than the first week of Advent. Many retailers are now pinning their hopes on the final spurt before the festive season,"" HDE managing director Stefan Genth said.
Footfall in city centers is also down, with two-thirds of city retailers reporting fewer customers than the previous year.
The HDE forecast total sales of just over €120 billion ($129 billion) for this year's Christmas business in November and December.
This corresponds to an increase in sales of 1.5% — effectively down on the previous year in terms of sales volume.
The streets and squares of Vienna have been lit up with sparkling lights, making the Austrian capital particularly festive around the holidays. Here, you can see the Christmas lights along the Vienna Graben, a lively shopping street.










""Overall, only 15% of the retailers surveyed are satisfied with how the Christmas business has gone so far,"" the HDE report said.
Retailers were said to be looking forward to the coming weeks with ""muted expectations,"" the survey said. Just under a fifth of retailers who were surveyed expect a positive development.
However, the HDE's Genth was less pessimistic, pointing out that, in the second half of December, the ever-approaching holidays usually provide additional sales impetus.
""If the festive mood increases in the near future, it can noticeably boost Christmas business,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/hong-kong-polls-open-in-patriots-only-council-elections/a-67681215,POLITICS,Hong Kong: Polls open in 'patriots only' council elections 10.12.2023,"Voting for Hong Kong's district council elections got underway on Sunday, with the pro-China city government dismissing concerns of a potentially low turnout as many pro-democracy voters turning their backs on the polls. 
Sunday's candidates were required to seek nominations from three government-appointed committees, which effectively shut out all pro-democracy parties.  
""It is the last piece of the puzzle for us to implement the principles of patriots governing Hong Kong,"" Hong Kong's pro-Beijing Chief Executive John Lee said while casting his ballot, referring to China's ongoing efforts to weed out political opposition. 
As part of a widespread clampdown in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory under a so-called national security law, city authorities overhauled the councils' composition earlier this year. 
According to the new rules, seats up for direct election were drastically cut from 462 to 88. The other 382 seats are now controlled by the city leader, government loyalists and rural landlords.
A pro-democracy group called the ""League of Social Democrats"" said three of its members were detained Sunday in the Central business district. The group had planned to protest the elections. 
""Hong Kong people's right to vote and to be elected seems to be absent,"" the group said in a statement reported by Reuters news agency.
A police statement said three people were arrested on suspicion of ""attempting to incite others to carry out acts that disrupt"" the district council elections.
The last district council elections were held at the height of the 2019 anti-government protests, attracting a record 71% turnout and a landslide victory for the democratic camp.
The councilors for Hong Kong's 18 districts handle mostly local-level tasks like sanitation, transport routes, and the maintenance of public facilities. However, since Beijing's crackdown, the council elections have been seen as a bellwether for public sentiment of Hong Kong's overall leadership.
Chief Executive Lee said Sunday the 2019 had been used to ""sabotage governance"" and endanger national security.
After Hong Kong was handed back to China by the United Kingdom in 1997, Beijing vowed Hong Kong the territory could retain its Western-style liberties for the next half-a-century under the ""one country, two systems"" framework.
However, massive protests in 2019 toward Beijing's increased tinkering with Hong Kong's legal system led to weeks of massive protests, and a large scale crackdown by Beijing.
Since then, leading figures of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement have been arrested or exiled, along with an overall crackdown on civil liberties and the free press.

https://www.dw.com/en/a-rubens-painting-keeps-the-courts-busy/a-67644466,ARTS,A Rubens painting keeps the courts busy 10.12.2023,"""Tarquinius and Lucretia"" is the subject of long German-Russian disputes. The painting by Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) disappeared from Germany after World War II. Around 20 years ago, it was discovered in Russia — in the possession of art dealer Vladimir Logvinenko.
The story didn't end there. Logvinenko tried to have his ownership rights recognized in Germany — unsuccessfully. This attempt at clarification could well have been motivated by a desire to sell the painting, which is estimated to be worth tens of millions of euros. As long as it is listed in all loss registers, however, such a request is impossible.
The judiciary has been dealing with the conundrum for over 20 years.
The Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg (Stiftung Preussische Schlösser und Gärten, SPSG) and the Russian citizen Vladimir Logvinenko are still fighting over the painting.
The German side claims that the painting was taken to the Soviet Union in the course of looting. According to the SPSG, ""the painting 'Tarquinius and Lucretia' by Peter Paul Rubens, painted around 1610 or 1611, was part of the collection in the Picture Gallery in Potsdam's Sanssouci Park before it was removed due to the war. Like the other paintings in the gallery, it was moved to the Rheinsberg Palace in 1942 to protect it from war damage.""
According to Russian accounts, the painting hung in the bedroom of a house in which a Soviet officer was residing in 1945. After the officer was transferred, he is said to have taken all the contents of the house, including the Rubens.
Finally, the dealer Logvinenko acquired the painting in 1999 and had it restored. The Potsdam public prosecutor's office investigated, but discontinued proceedings in 2006 because initial suspicion of a criminal offense had not been confirmed. The case concerned gang theft.
The Rubens painting has been a thorny issue in terms of German-Russian relations. Even the heads of state got involved. Hannes Hartung, a Munich-based lawyer specializing in international art law, wrote in his dissertation on ""Art theft in war and persecution"" that ""after the intervention of the two heads of state, Vladimir Putin and Gerhard Schröder, in September 2003, and the confiscation at the request of the Federal Republic of Germany, it had long looked as if a positive precedent could be established through the restitution of an important exhibit."" It seemed like the painting could be returned to Germany.
However, the Russian Federation's willingness to cooperate subsequently waned because ""the current owner insisted that he had acquired the painting in good faith and the Federal Republic of Germany was also unable to provide complete proof of ownership status and the exact circumstances of a war-related relocation,"" according to Hartung's explanation.
Nevertheless, Logvinenko is not the owner, according to the court ruling,
In 2021, Logvinenko then appealed to the Potsdam Regional Court to have his ownership rights to the painting recognized. In November 2023, the court ruled: ""The plaintiff is not the owner of the painting.""
When asked by DW, the Potsdam court explained that the legal dispute was subject to Russian law, as the painting was indisputably located in Russia at the time of Logvinenko's acquisition. The fact that the court was nevertheless able to reach its verdict is due to a legal opinion that was obtained. According to this, the court can now take the view ""that the plaintiff is not the owner of the painting under the relevant Russian law because he did not acquire ownership either through a legal transaction or through acquisition in good faith, and did not inherit it.""

The current court decision from Potsdam does not mean that the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg is the owner, nor does it mean that the entrepreneur from Russia must return the painting. The foundation told DW: ""A return was not the subject of the previous proceedings. Further steps are currently being examined.""
According to the SPSG, the Rubens painting had been ""considered lost since the end of the war. It is one of the most serious wartime losses of our foundation and was long-wanted by Interpol.""
The foundation has no information about where the painting is currently being kept. ""It was last in the possession of a Russian citizen (Editor's note: this refers to Vladimir Logvinenko), who wanted to go to court to establish that he was the owner. The SPSG has opposed this.""
Apparently, the Rubens painting is still in the possession of Vladimir Logvinenko. The Berlin-based law firm Unger, which represents Logvinenko, did not respond to an inquiry as to the purpose of the legal clarification regarding the recognition of ownership and why it took place in Germany.
Hannes Hartung, an expert in art law, explains: ""'Tarquinius and Lucretia' is still listed in all lost property registers. There is the state database 'Lost Art.' There are also private loss databases. A painting like this is completely unsaleable for the Russian owner as long as it is being sought as looted art, as it is now."" The ownership status is also highly questionable because it is looted art.
The lawyer from Munich assumes that the Russian investor has been advised to file a lawsuit. ""Many people hope that they can plead acquisitive prescription, i.e. that the painting was seized in good faith and they therefore became the owner,"" says Hartung.
The currently rejected complaint by the Russian citizen can really only mean one thing: The plaintiff wants to sell the Rubens abroad. ""He needs a kind of 'clean bill of health,' but he won't get one"" from the SPSG, explains expert Hannes Hartung, who once represented the art collector Cornelius Gurlitt under civil law.
The Gurlitt case goes back to a large art find that raised the question of whether Nazi-looted art was among the inherited artworks.
Logvinenko has to bear the costs of the Potsdam proceedings as the plaintiff. He can still appeal. Hartung believes that the art dealer may have speculated. ""He thought that he would be able to sell the painting on for a large profit at some point. That's not possible with looted art.""
Twenty years ago, it was still hoped that an agreement could be reached and that ""Tarquinius and Lucretia"" would be returned to Germany. And now? ""The German-Russian looted art debate is frozen. We had a very open relationship around 2006, 2007. Since the war in Ukraine, the door has been closed and there are no talks between Germany and the Russian Federation,"" summarizes Hartung.
The ambiguity over its ownership remains, and the stalemate may well go on for another 20 years.

https://www.dw.com/en/us-university-president-resigns-after-antisemitism-backlash/a-67680466,EDUCATION,US university president resigns after antisemitism backlash 10.12.2023,"The University of Pennsylvania's president, Liz Magill, resigned following criticism over her response to questions about antisemitism on college campuses at a congressional hearing, the school announced on Saturday.
""I write to share that President Liz Magill has voluntarily tendered her resignation as President of the University of Pennsylvania,"" Scott Bok, the chairman of the Ivy League school's board of trustees, said in the announcement released by the university. Bok also resigned effective immediately. 
Magill will stay on in her role until an interim president is appointed.
The controversy stemmed from a House committee hearing on antisemitism, where Magill, alongside Harvard and MIT's presidents — Claudine Gay and Sally Kornbluth — gave evasive answers trying to accommodate the US' far-reaching free speech laws when asked whether statements calling for the genocide of Jews would violate the university's code of conduct.
The hearing comes as the Israel-Hamas war has sparked pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses. Jewish students have said they feel unsafe, and some of the slogans used during the protests have been interpreted as calling for genocide against Jews. 
On being repeatedly asked by Republican Representative Elise Stefanik whether ""calling for the genocide of Jews"" would violate Penn's bullying and harassment rules, Magill replied, ""If the speech turns into conduct it can be harassment, yes.""
Pressed further, Magill told Stefanik, ""It is a context-dependent decision, congresswoman.""
American universities are increasingly facing criticism for failing to protect Jewish students from rising global antisemitism amid the current conflict in Gaza.
Amid the backlash and demands for her removal, Magill later tried to explain her viewpoint in a video but it was already too late.
""Over prepared and over lawyered given the hostile forum and high stakes, she provided a legalistic answer to a moral question, and that was wrong,"" Bok said in the statement on Saturday. ""It made for a dreadful 30-second sound bite in what was more than five hours of testimony.""
Seventy-four lawmakers wrote letters calling for the removal of Magill and the presidents of Harvard University and MIT.
A major donor said he would rescind a $100 million (just over €90 million) donation to the Ivy League university's Wharton School of Business. Stefanik called Magill's resignation the addressing of the ""pervasive rot of antisemitism"" on social media after Penn's announcement. ""One down. Two to go,"" she said.
Amid heightened tensions on US university campuses, there have been discussions regarding the point at which free speech becomes conduct that endangers others. 
Both antisemitism and Islamophobia have seen a significant increase in the United States and other countries since October 7.
The Anti-Defamation League reported a roughly 400% increase in antisemitic incidents in the US in the two weeks following the attack on Israel by the Islamist group Hamas, deemed a terrorist organization by the EU, US among others.
Meanwhile, the Council on American-Islamic Relations reported that, in the two months following the onset of the conflict, Islamophobic incidents against Palestinians and Arabs had risen by 172% compared to the same period in the previous year.

https://www.dw.com/en/how-the-eu-plans-to-regulate-artificial-intelligence/a-67679594,TECHNOLOGY,How the EU plans to regulate artificial intelligence 09.12.2023,"The impact that using artificial intelligence  will have in almost all areas of life is enormous. While there are huge opportunities for commercial enterprises, there are also risks for users. Even Sam Altman, the developer of the ChatGPT language model, has made such warnings. Some scientists even argue that there could be a threat to humans if artificial intelligence develops aggressive applications beyond our control.
This is why the EU set out to be the first major economic region worldwide to develop comprehensive regulations for AI. The aim is to achieve comprehensible, transparent, fair, safe and environmentally friendly AI, according to the European Commission's draft legislation. But this need not hinder development opportunities for AI startups, EU Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton said after the Commission, European Parliament representatives and the member state Council agreed on the proposal in what is known as a ""trilogue"" meeting between the three entities, which must now be approved by a committee vote and confirmed by the plenary.
The EU formulated a neutral definition of artificial intelligence, regardless of the technology used. This is intended to enable the law to be applied to future developments and the next generations of AI. The rules for specific AI products can then be issued in the form of simple ordinances.
AI products are divided into four risk classes: Unacceptable risk, high risk, generative AI and limited risk.
Systems that force people to change their behavior, for example toys that encourage children to perform dangerous actions, fall into the unacceptable category. The same goes for remote-controlled biometric recognition systems that recognize faces in real time. AI applications that divide people into classes based on certain characteristics such as gender, skin color, social behavior or origin will be banned.
Exceptions will be made for the military, intelligence services and investigative authorities.
AI programs that pose a high risk will be subject to a review before they are approved for the market to prevent any impact on fundamental rights. These risky applications include self-driving cars, medical technology, energy supply, aviation and toys.
However, they also include border surveillance, migration control, police work, the management of company personnel and recording biometric data in ID cards.
Programs intended to help with the interpretation and application of European AI law are also classified as high-risk and subject to regulation.
According to EU legislators, systems that generate new content and analyze vast amounts of data, such as generative AI products like ChatGPT from Microsoft subsidiary OpenAI, pose a medium risk.
Companies are obliged to be transparent about how their AI works and how it prevents illegal content from being generated. They must also disclose how the AI was trained and which copyright-protected data was used. All content generated with ChatGPT, for example, must be labeled.
According to the new EU rules, programs that manipulate and recreate videos, audio or photos pose only a low risk. This also includes so-called ""deep fakes,"" which are already commonplace on many social media platforms. Service programs that look after customers also belong to this risk class, with only minimal transparency rules to be applied.
Users must simply be made aware they are interacting with an AI application and not with humans. They can then decide for themselves whether or not to continue using the AI program.

After three long days of negotiations, the three main EU institutions — the European Commission, Parliament and Council of Ministers — have agreed on a preliminary draft law, which does not yet contain all the technically necessary provisions. This must now be formally approved by the European Parliament and the Council, the representative body of the 27 member states, which is due to take place in April 2024 at the end of the parliament's legislative period. Member states will then have two years to transpose the AI law into national law.
Given the rapid developments in artificial intelligence, there is a risk that the EU rules will already be outdated by the time they come into force, German Christian Democratic MEP Axel Voss warned before the whole process even began.
ChatGPT now offers paid programs that can be modified by users according to their wishes and specifications. According to UK broadcaster BBC's research, these ""toolkits"" can for instance do things like  write fraudulent emails for hackers or people with criminal intentions.
""We need to make sure that everything that has been agreed upon works in practice. The ideas in the AI law will only be workable if we have legal certainty, harmonized standards, clear guidelines and clear enforcement,"" Voss said in Brussels on Friday..
The Computer and Communications Industry Association in Europe (CCIA) warned on Saturday that the EU's compromise proposal is ""half-baked"" and could over-regulate many aspects of AI. ""The final AI Act lacks the vision and ambition that European tech startups and businesses are displaying right now. It might even end up chasing away the European champions that the EU so desperately wants to empower,"" CCIA Policy Manager Boniface de Champris told DW.
Consumer advocates from the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) lobbying group also criticized the draft law. Their initial assessment said the law is too lax because it gives companies too much room for self-regulation without providing sufficient guard rails for virtual assistants, toys or generative AI such as ChatGPT.
The United States, United Kingdom and 20 other countries have issued data protection rules and recommendations for AI developers, but none of these are legally binding, the expectation being that big tech companies working on AI should voluntarily monitor themselves. A ""Safety Institute"" in the US is meant to assess the risks of AI applications, while President Joe Biden has instructed developers to disclose their tests if national security, public health or safety are at risk.
In China, the use of AI for private customers and companies is severely restricted because the communist regime is afraid that it will no longer be able to censor learning systems as easily as censored the internet. ChatGPT, for example, is not available in China. However, facial recognition is already being used on a large scale on behalf of the state.

https://www.dw.com/en/eu-provisionally-agrees-first-ai-regulations/a-67675916,TECHNOLOGY,EU provisionally agrees first AI regulations 09.12.2023,"European Union member states and lawmakers reached a preliminary agreement on what they touted as the world's first comprehensive AI legislation on Friday.
This landmark deal aims to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including ChatGPT and governments' use of AI in biometric surveillance.
According to the European Parliament the new deal sets a global precedent as the world's first AI law, with the EU poised to be the first major region to implement such laws.
""Historic! The EU becomes the very first continent to set clear rules for the use of AI,"" EU Commissioner Thierry Breton, said on social media. ""The AI Act is much more than a rulebook — it's a launch pad for EU startups and researchers to lead the global AI race.""
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen heralded the ""global first"" AI Act ""for the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses.""
The agreement is sure to draw close attention from AI companies as various global players mull similar regulations.
The EU set global standards as it drafted the first rules of AI regulations in 2021.
The latest deal took shape after nearly 15 hours of talks, which followed an almost 24-hour debate the previous day.
One of the key sticking points was the use of AI for facial recognition surveillance and required intense negotiations.
The agreement includes provisions for transparency, safeguards, and severe penalties for non-compliance — with fines up to €35 million ($38 million) or 7% of a company's global revenue.
The final legislation will be worked out in the coming days and Brussels hopes it could come into force by 2025.

Europe's AI rules come at a time when companies such as OpenAI continue to develop their large language models and other projects. Google owner Alphabet launched a new AI model, Gemini, on Thursday.
Globally governments are looking to balance advantages of AI technology with the need for checks and balances.
In October, US President Joe Biden signed an executive order on AI safety standards, which followed China's regulating generative AI in August.
The EU negotiators are wary that too much regulations would roadblock European companies such as Germany's Aleph Alpha or France's Mistral AI ability to take on global competition.

https://www.dw.com/en/indonesia-rohingya-arrivals-exhausting-local-villages/a-67672011,HUMAN RIGHTS,Indonesia: Rohingya arrivals exhausting local villages 08.12.2023,"Zuhara Bagem, a Rohingya asylum-seeker who arrived with his family in Indonesia's Aceh province at the end of November, was relieved when the boat was allowed to land at Bireuen beach.
""If he had stayed on that boat for another one or two days, my children would probably have died. We had not eaten anything for ten days,"" Zuhara told DW.
After disembarking, many asylum-seekers lay exhausted on the beach or sat with relief to again be on dry land.
Over the past few weeks, many boats overloaded with Rohingya people have been arriving off the coast of Indonesia's westernmost Aceh province on Sumatra island. While some of the boats have managed to land safely on the shore, many others were rejected.
The Rohingya are a Muslim ethnic minority who were mainly based in Myanmar's Rakhine province before hundreds of thousands fled military persecution in 2017 to neighboring Bangladesh. Most are accommodated in the sprawling refugee camps at Cox's Bazar on Bangladesh's southeastern coast.
However, due to dangerous and squalid living conditions at Cox's Bazar, many Rohingya have fled again by sea to nearby Muslim-majority countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia.
The asylum-seekers risk an 1,800-kilometer (1,120-mile) sea voyage to Aceh province, and locals have reported boats trying to land in remote districts like Bireuen, Sabang, Pidie and Aceh Besar.
Many of Aceh's residents tried to ward off the boats after giving them little food and water.
Earlier this week, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said that an estimated 400 Rohingya Muslims are believed to be aboard two damaged boats adrift without food or water in the Andaman Sea, according to reports in The Associated Press. The UN warned these people face death if nothing is done to provide them with supplies or organize a rescue.
Although many Aceh residents initially accepted the Rohingya people, the onslaught of arrivals has increased tensions in the poor, remote province.
Some boats are repeatedly pushed back to sea, before finally being allowed to land after multiple attempts, according to local DW reporters.
Although the residents of Aceh share the same Islamic religious background, locals are concerned about the large number of arrivals.
Mauliadi, a villager in Bireuen, told DW that he hopes the Rohingya will go ""back to their own country.""
""I do not want them to move to other parts of Aceh. We hope that the local and central government can guard the sea, so that the Rohingya are not left unescorted,"" he said.
Most Rohingya do not have citizenship status in any country, making attempts at ""repatriation""a convoluted and complicated process. 
Local resident and member of the Aceh's local government, Iskandar Usman Alfarlaky, said that tensions between locals and the asylum-seekers have only risen recently.
""When the Rohingya first came to Aceh, there was no resistance from the locals. In fact, the people of Aceh accommodated them with shelter, provided food, drink, and all other necessities,"" he told DW. 
""However, recently an increasing number of Rohingya have entered Aceh,"" he added.
""In previous cases, many Rohingya left the designated camps and ran away. Locals also reported negative behaviors, which collided with their social and environmental norms. This is a problem. It then triggers resistance from residents,"" Alfarlaky said.

According to Indonesian government data, there are currently 1,487 Rohingya asylum-seekers registered in Indonesia. The number is expected to increase as more continue to arrive.
At present, Rohingya arrivals are placed in temporary shelters in Aceh and Medan in North Sumatra province and Pekanbaru in Riau province.
These shelters, however, are well over capacity. Some of the migrants have already fled, with their whereabouts unknown.
Indonesia's coordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs, Mahfud MD, told journalists this week that the government will find temporary shelters for the asylum-seekers.
He added that authorities will also coordinate with the coast guard to prevent more boats carrying Rohingya arrivals from entering Indonesian waters.
""What are you going to do with those who have already entered? We must use a humanitarian approach,"" he said, adding the Indonesian government will continue coordinating with the UNHCR on the matter. 
He admitted that current shelters and the local Aceh government are overwhelmed by the influx.
Munawaratul Makhya, a UNHCR field officer in Aceh, said it is common for Rohingya boats to arrive on Aceh's shores in November and December.
""Indeed, the pattern is that it is always busy at the end of the year. There are many factors, especially the sea conditions,"" Makhya told DW.
She said the UNHCR and the local government are providing the arrivals with first aid, food, water and temporary shelter.
However, Makhya admitted that the continuous influx is beginning to test the tolerance of locals towards the Rohingya, which she said is generally high. 
""People in Aceh experienced a lengthy conflict. Then there was a tsunami. So, life as a refugee is not something strange for the people of Aceh.""
Local lawmaker Alfarlaky said he hopes that the central government will act immediately to deal with the situation before tensions rise further.
""Because of humanity, we [people of Aceh] are obliged to help. But the people here also have extremely limited capabilities to help, especially economically,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/kenyas-facebook-case-meta-found-not-in-contempt/a-67663854,TECHNOLOGY,Kenya's Facebook case: Meta found not in contempt 08.12.2023,"Facebook's parent company Meta is not in contempt of court for not paying dozens of content moderators who were laid off by the subcontractor, Sama.
The ruling comes after scores of content moderators had been made redundant by Sama, a Facebook contractor, in March this year. A number of them subsequently filed a lawsuit suing Meta, Sama and other contractors for unfair dismissal.
Negotiations for the parties involved to pursue an out-of-court settlement through mediation then collapsed in October after the moderators who had brought the lawsuit dismissed an offer saying it was too low.
In his decision, judge Mathews Nduma Nderi said on Thursday that the US tech giant had not ""deliberately and contemptuously"" breached a court order still requiring Meta to pay wages to the moderators.
""They did various things which they thought were lawful in trying to deal with their situation, but we did not find that what they did amounted to contempt,"" Nderi said.
The contempt of court application against Meta and its contractors was lodged after in an earlier ruling, a different judge had banned Meta from laying off the workers while a decision on their case was still pending.
However, the content moderators said they hadn't been paid during this period as the court had ruled they should be, resulting in a contempt case being lodged.
US-based sub-contractor Sama was first hired by Facebook to moderate its content in east and southern Africa in 2019. In March 2023, Sama decided to withdraw from the content moderation business for what it said were economic reasons, which resulted in mass terminations, mainly affecting its hub in Kenya's capital, Nairobi.
However, the sacked content moderators believe they were fired because of attempts to unionize as well as due to complaints over working conditions and a lack of mental health support.
They say they also were blocked from applying for jobs at a second subcontractor, Luxembourg-based Majorel, which later was awarded the African content moderation contract by Facebook after its withdrawal from Sama.
Thursday's ruling meanwhile does not signal an end coming to the highly publicized lawsuit. The legal counsel representing the content moderators now has 45 days to amend its contempt of court petition.
The judge also highlighted that unless the matter was resolved out of court, the case would be given priority for the court to determine its merits.
After Thursday's ruling, British tech rights group Foxglove, which is supporting the plaintiffs, said it was still eager to bring the ongoing case to trial.
""We remain confident of our case overall, as we have prevailed on every substantive point so far,"" Foxglove director Martha Dark told the Reuters news agency, adding: ""The most important ruling remains the one we won in June; Meta can no longer hide behind outsourcers to excuse the exploitation and abuse of its content moderators.""
In early June, Kenya's employment court had ruled that Meta was still the ""principal"" employer of the outsourced content moderators working in the Nairobi hub, and that therefore it could be held liable under Kenyan law, especially since their work tasks were carried out using Meta's own proprietary technology, while also adhering to the tech giant's performance and accuracy metrics.
As part of a broader interim decision, the court ruling in June also resulted in Meta being ordered to ""provide proper medical, psychiatric and psychological care"" to the moderators, as their jobs entailed screening content uploaded by users and removing any uploads deemed to be in breach of Facebook's community standards.
This exposed them to disturbing images, including rape, murder, suicide and self-harm. the moderators said they were traumatized by viewing this endless streams of highly graphic content.
""The reason we don't see videos of beheadings and sexual violence on Facebook is because there are content moderators on the front line, constantly consuming this content, reviewing it and taking it down before you and I have a chance to look at it,"" lawyer Mercy Mutemi, who represents 43 of the plaintiffs, said after Thursday's ruling.
""Facebook and Sama lure young, promising yet vulnerable, and unsuspecting youth from Kenya and other African countries,"" she told DW.
Earlier this month, DW spoke to a young woman from Ethiopia, who had worked as a content moderator for Facebook in Nairobi. Requested to remain anonymous, she said: ""All you see is manslaughter, dismembered bodies or people being burnt alive, there's no warning.
""And once you see it, you can't unsee it.""
Meta, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, meanwhile faces another two lawsuits in Kenya alone:
Another former content moderator is suing Sama and Facebook in Kenya for a raft of alleged rights violations, including exploitation and union-busting. In the lawsuit lodged in 2022, Daniel Motaung claims he was paid as little as $2.20 (€2.04) an hour to view posts that included beheadings and child abuse, affecting his long-term mental health. 
Furthermore, a local NGO lodged a $1.6 billion lawsuit alongside two Ethiopian citizens, accusing Meta of inflaming the civil war in Ethiopia due to its alleged failure to remove hate speech on Facebook.
Despite mounting legal troubles, East Africa continues to witness growing interest from international tech firms, which often use third-party outsourcing companies. With its young and tech-savvy English speakers, stable internet connection and a similiar time zone to much of Europe, countries like Kenza and Ethiopia are becoming increasingly attractive for conglomerates like Meta and its subsidiaries.
However, low pay rates and insecure employment contracts, coupled with this exposure to graphic content, raise questions about the exploitative conditions that content moderators often have to work under.

https://www.dw.com/en/has-spains-olive-oil-become-a-luxury-item/a-67666882,BUSINESS,Has Spain's olive oil become a luxury item? 08.12.2023,"The real stress for Spain's olive tree begins in autumn. Olive groves can tolerate long periods of drought from April to September and sudden frosts in November.
But if trees lose their fruit between October and February, due to strong shaking by the harvesting machine and are pruned directly, ""then they suffer,"" Ruben Gomez, who manages production and harvest at Garcia de la Cruz agricultural firm, told DW.
""So far they have been allowed to rest for a year, but that will change soon,"" he added.
Harvesting is currently underway on his rocky plantation near Toledo, southwest of the Spanish capital, Madrid. Here, unlike in the olive mecca of Jaen in southern Andalusia, the soil is not a beautiful reddish brown, but rather a boring gray.
Gomez's people have been active in the field since the beginning of October. A tractor with a special device grabs each tree trunk and shakes it, at the same time men hit the branches with long sticks.
Depending on the degree of ripeness, green, pink or black olives rain down on the black net stretched out under the tree.
""It is an enormous stress for the tree. The vibration should therefore not last longer than 15 seconds and the hitting should be done carefully,"" explains Gomez.
As a rule, each tree produces around 40 kilos (88 pounds) of fruit. However, a historic drought in some regions of Spain is leading to very poor harvests in many areas.
The olive tree doesn't need too much water, but during flowering in May, it can't stand too much heat. Last summer, that’s exactly what happened, sparking a skyrocketing in prices for olive oil in recent months.
Garcia de la Cruz, on the other hand, is one of the few producers in Spain who have ensured their trees bear fruit every year, thanks to a gentle harvesting technique and the partial irrigation of their plantation.
Around a quarter of the plantation is now artificially irrigated, with probes measuring exactly when and how much water the tree needs.

The Spanish's expertise in growing, and squeezing olive juice is now in global demand. Spain's olive oil is still considered among the best — and the country produces the largest volume.
World market prices are decided in the olive mecca of Jaen, where the entire landscape is covered with olive groves. The producer price there is currently around €8 ($6.63) a liter. In the store, a bottle of olive oil costs a full €10 — more than double what it was two years ago.
""Despite this [price increase], demand on the global market remains high,"" said Gomez, who sees an enormous opportunity in the current situation.
Spain has now not only set up olive plantations of their successful varieties in the United States, but is also supplying tons of unpackaged olive oil to their main competitor Italy.
Some industry experts think the rise in exports, now up to half of Spain's olive oil goes overseas, has led to higher prices for domestic consumers.
""Spain should therefore manage its supply chain itself,"" Antonio Canadilla, president of the Cooperativa San Sebastian-Aceites Umbrion cooperative, told DW.
He noted that the Italians are selling Spanish oil under their own brands, so many consumers now believe that the Italians and not the Spanish are the market leaders in the olive business.
""But despite this, none of our comrades want to invest in marketing and sales,"" he added.
Another problem is that Spain's system of agricultural cooperatives is often characterized by outdated business structures. They still control 80% of the market.
Despite very few women being involved in the olive oil market, García de la Cruz is a bit of a trailblazer. The company was founded 150 years ago by a woman and is one of the few olive oil producers in Spain that completely controls its supply chain, guaranteeing not only high margins but also more competitive prices.
The firm exports almost all of its production to Japan and the US, where liter bottles have been sold for years at twice the price as at home.
In contrast, over the past two years, crop failures and structural problems in Spain's olive market have now exacerbated inflation across the Spanish food chain, so olive oil has become a luxury item.
According to a study by the Autonomous University of Madrid, food prices in Spain rose by 15.7% last year. This year, the inflation rate remains at roughly the same level.
As a result, Spaniards are already changing their buying choices and the cooperative Canadilla predicts that consumption of olive oil nationally will fall by 38% this year alone.
Economist Rafael Pampillon from the Madrid University of San Pablo CEU is convinced that speculation in the domestic market is helping prices higher.
""But it is also a fact that olive oil in France and Portugal is significantly cheaper than here,"" he told DW.
While the climate may be better in those two countries, demand in Spain has always been high as the Spanish see olive oil not as a gourmet product, but as a staple food.
To reduce price pressures, some grocery chains such as the Galician Froiz or Mercadona have stepped up imports of cheaper olive oil from Portugal. But they can only do this because of already established purchasing channels in Portugal, Pampollon said.
""Supply chains cannot simply be changed overnight; that costs a lot of money,"" he told DW, adding that he does not see food prices in Spain falling anytime soon.
The olive tree remains an ideal shrub for Spain, even though the country's landscape is suffering from climate change.
""The olive tree only needs rainwater and can endure droughts,” Jose Maria Tarujuelo Martin-Benito, director of the Water Institute of Castile-La Mancha, told DW. ""There are trees that have been in Spain for several hundred years.""
He believes that Spain's rural water shortages can be solved through technology and therefore no reduction in olive production is necessary. He is working on solutions to boost productivity without further polluting the environment.
Enrique García-Tenorio, founder of the Denomination of Origin (DO) for olive oil from the Montes de Toledo area predicts that prices will come down in 2025, helping to stabilize the domestic market.
He told DW that a liter of olive oil would then cost between €3-4 euros in the store.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-to-extend-temporary-border-controls-for-2-months/a-67665728,MIGRATION,Germany to extend temporary border controls for 2 months 08.12.2023,"German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has said that the controls on people crossing into Germany at the border with Poland, Switzerland and the Czech Republic will be extended for a further two months.
Faeser told the German newspaper Rheinische Post that the measures which had been set to end on December 15 would continue until at least February, in an interview published on Friday.
""Our measures are working. Our fight against the unscrupulous business of people smugglers, who brutally jeopardize human lives, is successful,"" the Social Democrat minister said.
The measures — which were introduced back in October and extended to December 15 on Monday — saw extra police officers sent to the borders with the three neighboring countries to carry out checks on people seeking to cross.
The aim is to reduce the number of people migrating to Europe to enter Germany.
Although the Schengen Zone, of which all four countries are members, allows for visa-free travel between states, members have regularly introduced border checks to inhibit the movement of non-EU individuals — but specifically refugees — within the Schengen area.
Germany has carried out border checks on the border with fellow EU member state Austria since 2015.

The Ministry of the Interior said that some 9,200 unauthorized entries had been detected and another 4,370 had been prevented since the measures were introduced in October.
""This means that these measures are working and will continue to do so,"" a ministry spokesperson said.
However, one of Germany's main police unions, the GdP, was more critical of the measures and questioned how effective they were.
Andreas Roßkopf from the GdP told the Rheinische Post that police would not be able to significantly reduce the number of asylum-seekers.
It needs to be clarified ""whether thousands of police officers should actually remain at the border or whether they would not be better deployed for security in the cities and the asylum problem solved within the EU framework,"" he said.
The number of asylum applications reached a new record of 35,000 in November, according to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees.
Germany requires continued migration to balance out its aging population and fill gaps in the labor market, but concerns about illegal arrivals have led to a surge in support for the anti-immigration far right. 
In response, the center-left coalition government has taken a number of increasingly drastic steps to reduce migration.

https://www.dw.com/en/olaf-scholz-the-most-unpopular-german-chancellor-ever/a-67667351,POLITICS,Olaf Scholz: The most unpopular German chancellor ever 08.12.2023,"It's an awkward time for the Social Democrat Party to celebrate itself. The center-left SPD gathers this weekend for its national party conference, in Berlin, on the heels of yet another major poll showing how unloved they are. 
If general elections were held now, the party of Chancellor Olaf Scholz would only receive 14% of the vote. That is another 2% lower than last month's figure and the lowest since June 2021, according to DeutschlandTrend, a monthly tracking of political sentiment among the German electorate.
The Greens, who support the SPD in a coalition, land slightly ahead at 15%. The government's third party, the business-first Free Democrats (FDP), would fall under the 5% threshold required to sit in parliament. That is also true of the socialist Left Party, which recently fractured into two groups.
The representative poll, carried out by the research group infratest-dimap surveyed 1,364 eligible voters between December 4-6 by phone and email. Of them, just 17 percent said they are satisfied with the SPD-led government. For Scholz himself, that figure is one-fifth. It's the lowest approval rating of a German chancellor in the history of the poll, which has been tracking monthly sentiment since 1997.
Scholz's defense minister and fellow SPD comrade, Boris Pistorius, is polling strongest of the major political figures listed. Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, of the Greens, enjoys the second-highest favorability rating, at 38%. And opposition leader Friedrich Merz, chairman of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is gaining support and polls in third place.

The current legislative period has been one of crises: the tail-end of the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia's full invasion of Ukraine, and the ensuing inflationary spiral and energy insecurities. Then last month, Germany's constitutional court agreed with the opposition CDU/CSU that the government's budget plans were illegal. It wanted to reallocate more than 60 billion euros ($64.7 billion) in unused credit, earmarked for the pandemic, for climate action.
The ruling has blown a huge hole in public finances, sparking a budget crisis with no clear solution. Broadly speaking, the government can either cut spending, raise taxes or declare a public emergency that would allow raising debt beyond constitutional limits.
Polling suggests that voters are as unsure as their elected officials on the least bad way forward. The largest number of them, 47%, are for cuts, while 35% are for more borrowing. Very few want to pay more in taxes. 
If cuts do come, two-thirds of voters appear comfortable with sacrificing low-income benefits, in a scheme known as ""citizens' money."" More than half would claw back savings in military aid to Ukraine. There is also a plurality of respondents, 41%, who would cut support for making the economy more climate-friendly.
The drop in support for climate action comes against the backdrop of the COP28 gathering in Dubai. A solid majority, 62%, expressed the view that Germany has done plenty to combat climate change and that other countries need to step up.
Still, 7 in 10 German voters think that lifestyle changes are essential to stopping climate change — a high number, but off its peak when the same question was asked in 2019.

https://www.dw.com/en/hunter-biden-indicted-on-new-federal-tax-evasion-charges/a-67663399,POLITICS,Hunter Biden indicted on new federal tax evasion charges 08.12.2023,"United States President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, has been indicted on nine new tax charges by a special counsel investigating his business dealings.
The new charges in California follow not guilty pleas he made in July to two separate tax evasion charges and gun possession charges.
The White House declined to comment on the new indictment. 
Hunter Biden is accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million (€1.29 million) in taxes he owed between 2016 and 2019.
If convicted, the younger Biden could face up to 17 years in prison. The special counsel probe remains open, the Justice Department said.
Special counsel David Weiss said in a statement: ""Hunter Biden spent millions of dollars on an extravagant lifestyle rather than paying his tax bills.""
The indictment said that Hunter Biden ""spent more than $1.8 million, including approximately $772,000 in cash withdrawals, approximately $383,000 in payments to women, approximately $151,000 in clothing and accessories"" among other expenditures.
""The Defendant did not use any of these funds to pay his taxes in 2018.""

In response to the new charges, defense attorney Abbe Lowell accused Weiss of ""bowing to Republican pressure"" in the case.
""Based on the facts and the law, if Hunter's last name was anything other than Biden, the charges in Delaware, and now California, would not have been brought,"" Lowell said in a statement.
With less than a year until the next US presidential election, the new indictment comes as Joe Biden continues to face a possible impeachment inquiry from congressional Republicans.
It is claimed that the US president engaged in an influence-peddling scheme with his son. The House is expected to vote next week on formally authorizing the inquiry.
No evidence has emerged so far to prove that Joe Biden, in his current or previous office, abused his role or accepted bribes.
The 53-year-old entered a not guilty plea in July to two charges of not paying tax on more than $1.35 million (€1.22 million) in income in 2018 and 2018, with prosecutors saying that he owed more than $100,000.
This is in addition to the charge of unlawfully owning a firearm while addicted to and using a controlled substance. This is classified as a felony under US law, which Biden pled not guilty to in October.
Those charges came after a pretrial diversion agreement for just the tax evasion charges with federal prosecutors in Delaware fell apart.
It was an alternative to prosecution that allows defendants to avoid conviction and prison time and prosecutors had planned to recommend two years of probation. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.
However, US District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika said she was concerned about the language in the plea deal and recommended lawyers discuss it.

https://www.dw.com/en/las-vegas-shooting-suspect-identified-as-troubled-academic/a-67663461,POLITICS,Las Vegas shooting: Suspect identified as troubled academic 08.12.2023,"The gunman in a deadly shooting at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), was a financially struggling academic, police said on Thursday. 
The shooter, who died at the scene, killed three people on Wednesday and injured another.
Police identified the perpetrator as Anthony James Polito. The 67-year-old had a list of targets at UNLV and East Carolina University in North Carolina, where he once taught.
He had applied for jobs at several educational institutions in the US state of Nevada, but was denied employment each time, authorities said.
Polito appeared to have sent 22 letters to various university personnel across the country with no return address, the police said.
Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said authorities had managed to intercept the letters before they were delivered. A suspicious white powdery substance was found in at least one of them.
The UNLV shooting left at least three people dead before the suspect's death. All victims were faculty members but none of them were on the list of targets. A fourth individual, a 38-year-old visiting professor, was injured and his condition was downgraded to life-threatening on Thursday, police said.
UNLV President Keith E. Whitfield said that the shooting ""was the most difficult day in the history of our university."" He identified two of the victims as business school professors Patricia Navarro-Velez and Cha Jan ""Jerry"" Chang.
While the precise motive for the shooting had not been determined, officials said UNLV students did not appear to be the primary target of the attack. However, authorities noted that Polito had applied for several jobs at different colleges and universities in Nevada and was denied the job each time.
""We know he had applied numerous times for jobs with several Nevada higher education institutions,"" McMahill said, without specifying whether UNLV was one of them.
He added that police had uncovered evidence that Polito was struggling financially, citing an eviction notice on the door of his residence. He had a previous criminal record of computer trespass back in 1992 in Virginia.
This weekend the US logged its 37th and 38th mass shootings of the year, surpassing last year's grim record of 36. A mass shooting is defined as an incident in which four or more people are killed, not including the perpetrator.
At least 203 people have been killed in mass shootings in the US this year.
Las Vegas was also the site of one of the worst such incidents in US history when in 2017 a lone gunman in a 32nd-floor suite in the Mandalay Bay Casino killed 60 people and injured over 400 more when he shot more than 1,000 rounds at a crowd gathered at a country music festival below.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-budget-chaos-no-vote-on-2024-spending-this-year/a-67659587,POLITICS,German budget chaos: No vote on 2024 spending this year 07.12.2023,"The German parliament will not have time to vote on the country's 2024 budget before the end of the year, a senior lawmaker from Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD) wrote in a text message sent to the party members and seen by several news agencies on Thursday.
""Although we have done as much as possible from our side, the budget for the year 2024 can no longer be finalized in time this year,"" wrote Katja Mast, a senior SPD lawmaker.
However, Mast added, referring to discussions in the party leadership that Scholz ""is confident that a result can be achieved in the coming days.""

Scholz's three-party coalition with the environmentalist Greens and business-focused FDP is under huge pressure to resolve the country's budget crisis, which followed a landmark court ruling that struck down some of the government's spending plans.
Now the coalition has to find a solution for the 2024 budget, which is €17 billion ($18.3 billion) short.
Scholz is currently negotiating with Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck (Greens) and Finance Minister Christian Lindner (FDP). The talks are to continue on Friday. The SPD and Greens want the so-called debt brake to be suspended again, which the FDP rejects.
The SPD said it expected at least one meeting of the budget committee before Christmas to work out the details of the budget. Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said on Wednesday that he expected a Cabinet decision before Christmas.
The problem is, even if a deal is reached, there will not be time for the financial plans to go through parliament this year.
""This is however not a crisis,"" German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said, playing down the need to get the budget through parliament before the end of the year. 
""I have realized that the coalition partners have very ambitious timetables,"" Lindner said on Thursday in Brussels. 
He said that a political agreement on the structure of next year's budget was likely to come in a couple of days. ""The work has not yet been fully completed,"" Lindner added.
If no agreement is reached, the coalition could collapse, but most observers say it is in the interest of all parties to reach an agreement and stay in power. A temporary budget for next year could be implemented if no agreement is reached.

https://www.dw.com/en/jobs-in-germany-bringing-together-craft-trade-apprenticeships-and-young-jobseekers/a-67650450,BUSINESS,Germany's new scheme to bridge skilled labor gap in trade 07.12.2023,"So, you've finished school. Now what? In Germany, many young people go to college. Others sign up for a year of voluntary social work. The one thing many young people don't do is learn a trade, and the numbers show it. Last year, every second trade business couldn't find enough suitable applicants for all their apprenticeship training positions.
""The trades really have problems getting enough young talent,"" said Kilian Bizer, a professor of economic policy at the University of Göttingen.
This is particularly true for trades working with climate change technologies. Tradespeople are in high demand for everything from installing solar systems or heat pumps to renovating house facades or connecting charging stations for electric cars.
Apprenticeships are also important to alleviate the shortage of skilled workers that already exists in the trades. But how do you attract young people to careers that usually require a lot of physical activity?
One idea has come out of the Ahr Valley, a region in western Germany in the state of Rhineland Palatinate. Tradespeople are particularly sought after here because the area was hit by a severe flood in 2021. Many buildings, roads and other infrastructure were damaged or completely destroyed. Volunteers poured in to help. A lot needed to be done. But like in the rest of Germany, businesses here lacked young talent.
So why not bring both things together — volunteering and trade jobs? This is the idea behind a project initiated in March 2022 by the state's labor ministry and the Koblenz Chamber of Crafts.
The project lets young people try out various trades for six to eight months and at the same time help rebuild the Ahr Valley.
More than 50 companies are opening their doors to prospective carpenters, bricklayers, tilers, painters, metal workers and automotive mechanics. The Koblenz Chamber of Crafts has also opened its training workshops for participants. Plus, everyone receives accommodation and €470 ($508) per month.
Alexander Lehnhoff and Constantin Sper are two people the program brought together.
Lehnhoff has been running his own carpentry business for three years with around 10 employees. Compared to some, he's been lucky. His business was spared on the night of the flood.
Sper's family home wasn't so fortunate. After the 22-year-old finished high school, he helped out at home and volunteered in his community. Then he started studying to become a teacher.
But Sper was unhappy studying. When he found out about the project from a painter who helped renovate his family's house, it caught his attention.
""I already had the idea of learning a trade,"" said Sper. ""But especially after the flood, when I worked at home like a full-time tradesman for eight months, I felt like doing something in the trade sector.""
The Koblenz Chamber of Crafts is pleased with the project. So far, more than half of the participants later start apprenticeships in one of the companies, says Ralf Hellrich from the tradework organization.
""In 2021 and 2022, we had a 10-year high in filling apprenticeship positions in the Ahr Valley,"" Hellrich told DW. He believes the project had a wider impact, too, since many young people started apprenticeships in the region without taking the detour through the project.
Somewhat surprisingly, unlike other tradesmen, Lehnhoff says that he hasn't yet had any problems recruiting young people. On the contrary, he has more applications than he can accept.
He thinks the lack of apprentices in other companies ""is not necessarily because there are only bad or too few apprentices, but rather because companies don't engage enough with the apprentices."" For him, a good team and giving employees a say are particularly important. Soon word gets around.
""The Ahr Valley is like a giant village where everyone knows everyone and every company. Young people obviously share stories about companies,"" said Lehnhoff.
This makes him optimistic that he will continue to have a relatively easy time finding new talent in the future. But just to be safe, he also takes part in a local trainee job fair that he started with other local businesses.  
What secondary school graduates tend to ignore is that trade work is not just tough work. For many, there is a big reward in seeing what you can do with your own hands.
""When it comes to their lives and their jobs, tradespeople are above average satisfied,"" confirmed the University of Göttingen's Bizer.
This is also evident in Lehnhoff's carpentry business. He is very happy with his career choice, even though his father, who is also a carpenter, advised him against it. Telling him he could do something easier. Despite working 70 hours a week, Lehnhoff is showing that easier is not always better.
The Ahr Valley development project ends at the end of 2023. However, due to its success, it could be extended. ""We are in discussions with the labor ministry, and the project will probably be prolonged,"" said Hellrich.

It was not initially clear whether the suspect was shot dead by police or had committed suicide. Another person who was shot by the gunman is in a critical condition.
The university released a post on X shortly after noon local time (2000 GMT) Wednesday telling students, ""This is not a test. RUN-HIDE-FIGHT.""
The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMP) also took to social media Wednesday to announce that officers were at the scene and had ""contained"" the suspect. Moments later the department announced that the suspect ""has been located and is deceased."" 
Sheriff Kevin McMahill later added that there was no further threat on campus. 
Authorities released no additional information on the shooter but told students and residents to avoid the area near the shooting, which took place at Beam Hall, where the university's business school is located. The UNLV student union is also located next to the building.
University authorities instructed people to ""shelter in place"" until further notice, saying the all clear had not been given, and adding: ""Police are evacuating buildings one at a time. This remains an active investigation.""
The LVMP said it had ""no idea about motive.""
This weekend the US logged its 37th and 38th mass shootings of the year, surpassing last year's grim record of 36.
A mass shooting is defined as an incident in which four or more people are killed, not including the perpetrator.
At least 203 people have been killed in mass shootings in the US this year.
Las Vegas was also the site of one of the worst such incidents in US history when in 2017 a lone gunman in a 32nd-floor suite in the Mandalay Bay Casino killed 60 people and injured over 400 more when he shot more than 1,000 rounds at a crowd gathered at a country music festival below.

https://www.dw.com/en/is-it-all-over-for-the-eu-mercosur-free-trade-deal/a-67649408,TRADE,Is it all over for the EU-Mercosur free trade deal? 06.12.2023,"Officially, the free trade agreement between the EU and the four states of the Mercosur economic bloc — Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay — has not yet been shelved for good. But at the Mercosur summit that is taking place until Thursday in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, a declaration that the agreement to create the biggest free trade zone in the world has once again been postponed is currently being drafted.
According to a report in the Brazilian daily newspaper Folha de S. Paulo the message will be that the ""negotiations for the deal did not fail but will be continued despite the controversies of recent days.""
The idea is to resume talks immediately after the right-wing populist Javier Milei is inaugurated as the new Argentinian president on December 10, after winning this year's general election by a landslide.
The failure of the negotiations is a setback for Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who was apparently hoping to conclude the free trade agreement before the end of Brazil's temporary presidency of Mercosur this week.
""I felt that Lula would have preferred to sign today rather than tomorrow,"" German lawmaker Knut Gerschau from the Free Democrats (FDP), who is the chair of the Committee on Economic Affairs in the German Bundestag, told DW.
The Brazilian president was in Berlin for intergovernmental consultations between Brazil and Germany. He said that he would continue to fight for the deal as it would be irrational not to sign it after more than 20 years of negotiations. 
""I am Brazilian and never give up,"" he pledged at a press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. ""So long as I have not spoken with each individual president, I will not give up.""
Negotiations between the EU and Mercosur were launched in 2000. The latest setback can reportedly be attributed to the presidential elections in Argentina. On November 30, the Argentinian government informed members of Mercosur that a decision on free trade agreement would not be made before the new president took office. According to reports in the media, this led to European Commissioner for Trade Valdis Dombrovskis cancelling his planned trip to the Mercosur summit in Rio de Janeiro at short notice.
A few days later, French President Emmanuel Macron criticized the free trade agreement for being ""old-fashioned,"" and ""incoherent,"" after a meeting with Brazilian President Lula on the sidelines of the COP 28 Summit in Dubai. 

If it were signed, the EU-Mercosur agreement would create a free trade zone boasting more than 743 million inhabitants (448 million in the EU, 295 in the Mercosur bloc) that would thus be the largest in the world. The two blocs already have very close trade relations, and according to EU statistics, EU investment into Mercosur states increased from €130 billion ($140 billion) in 2000 to 330 billion ($356 billion) in 2020.
However, the agreement is about more than about dismantling trade barriers: Samina Sultan, an economist at the German Economic Institute (IW) in Berlin, explained in her analysis that ""the democracies of the Mercosur states are important partners in terms of values.""
She said that the EU could not afford to decrease its efforts. Because by contrast with the EU, China has continuously expanded its role in the region in recent years. 
According to the UN Comtrade database, exports from the region to China climbed 112% between 2012 and 2022, from $47 billion per year to $100 billion. Imports from China to the region also rose by 80%, from $51 billion to $92 billion, in the same period. Trade with the EU on the other hand has stagnated, with both imports and exports between the two blocs remaining at level of around $60 billion per year.

Santiago Pena, the president of Paraguay, which takes over the Mercosur presidency from Brazil this week, blames the EU for the failure of the negotiations. He told the Paraguayan television channel Gen that the EU was not interested in an agreement and was, therefore, imposing conditions that were impossible to fulfill, particularly regarding the environment.
""It goes so far as its questioning our authorities and their monitoring and wanting to make its own assessments,"" Pena was quoted as saying by the Argentinian business paper Ambito Financiero. ""To me, this signifies a loss of sovereignty, and that is practically inacceptable.""
In September, Pena had already announced that Paraguay would be looking for other trade partners, citing Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Singapore.
Brazilian Environment Minister Marina Silva has also voiced criticism of the EU.
In September, she told DW that she regretted that the ""EU always treats President Lula's government as if it were the government of ex-President [Jair] Bolsonaro."" She pointed out that while the latter had not cared about the ""Paris Agreement on climate change, the environment and indigenous rights,"" the current government had ""reduced deforestation in the Amazon by 48% in the first seven months of the year.""
Many environmental groups and human rights organizations are actually relieved that the free trade agreement has been postponed. Dozens of civil society organizations have called for an alternative agreement to be negotiated.
""It is good news for the climate and human rights that the agreement has not been adopted in a rush job for the time being,"" said Armin Paasch, a trade expert at the Catholic relief organization Misereor.

https://www.dw.com/en/putin-visits-uae-saudi-arabia-in-rare-foreign-trip/a-67644987,POLITICS,"Putin visits UAE, Saudi Arabia in rare foreign trip 06.12.2023","Russian President Vladimir Putin traveled to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia on Wednesday.
Russian state media reported that Putin's plane had touched down in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi. Images broadcast on state television showed him being greeted by officials on the runway.
Putin held talks with UAE President Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi before traveling to Saudi Arabia for his first face-to-face meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman since October 2019.
The Russian leader was seen meeting bin Salman before sitting down for televised talks.
""Nothing can prevent the development of our friendly relations,"" Putin told the Saudi royal and invited him to visit Moscow.
""It is very important for all of us to exchange information and assessments with you on what is happening in the region. Our meeting is certainly timely,"" Putin said.
The Russian leader's visit coincides with the United Nations COP28 climate talks taking place in Dubai, although it was unclear whether Putin would attend. His trip also comes despite an arrest warrant against him from the International Criminal Court over the war in Ukraine.

""Putin is the person most responsible for the horrible ... war Russia is waging in Ukraine which led to the suffering of millions,"" EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra told DW at COP28. 
""Our perspective is that, you know, there can be no business as usual. And it is up to countries who do decide to receive him to explain why they find that a good idea.""
The Kremlin said talks in Saudi Arabia would involve discussions on energy cooperation, including as part of OPEC+, whose members pump more than 40% of the world's oil.
Other items on the agenda include Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, the situation in Syria and Yemen, and broader issues of stability in the Gulf, as well as the war in Ukraine, the Kremlin said.
The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Putin in March for war crimes, accusing him of personal responsibility for the alleged abduction of children from Ukraine. 
Neither Saudi Arabia nor the UAE signed the ICC's founding treaty, which means they're under no obligation to arrest Putin over the warrant.

https://www.dw.com/en/what-does-the-eus-ai-act-mean-for-europes-smes/a-67636579,BUSINESS,What does the EU's AI Act mean for Europe's SMEs? 06.12.2023,"Martin Ragan, co-founder of Slovak startup Cequence.io, enters a prompt into a simple chatbot interface. In less than 10 seconds, the underlying artificial intelligence, or AI, sifts through thousands of contracts with tens of thousands of pages and spits out a detailed answer.
""The bullet points refer to a part of the contract you can navigate right away to and check the answer,"" Ragan told DW. ""Risk mitigation is a huge part of this: 'Would I pay a penalty if I did this with supplier x?' Now, you can make an educated business decision.""
Ragan, who says the chatbot is 80-90% accurate during the implementation and gets better as it learns from more customer data, presented his AI contract management software at the Basque Open Industry exhibition in Bilbao last month.
1,000 kilometers (620 miles) to the northeast, in Brussels, the negotiations about the EU's AI Act are in the last phase of the legislative process.
Presented by the European Parliament in June, the bloc's key piece of legislation to regulate artificial intelligence has the overarching goal of putting ""guardrails"" around the development and use of the technology.
Ragan thinks the AI Act will have both positive and negative consequences. 
""The opinions we are hearing are mixed. We work with highly sensitive data; if the regulations give more trust to our clients — trust meaning the data is safe, and the AI won't just take it and put it somewhere where we don't want to have it — it's gonna have a positive impact for us as well.""
It appears unlikely that EU member states and lawmakers will reach a deal by their December 6 deadline. In mid-November, negotiations on the draft law abruptly stopped over so-called foundation models — large deep learning neural networks that power chatbots like the one of Cequence.io.
Then, Germany, France and Italy, the EU's three largest countries, spoke out against the tiered approach initially envisaged on foundation models. They warned that slapping tough restrictions on these newfangled models would harm the EU's own champions, like German OpenAI competitor Aleph Alpha.
Instead, they suggested self-regulating foundation models through company pledges and codes of conduct.
Networks like Digital SME, however, have warned that this proposed self-regulation would shift the responsibility of conforming to the regulation to companies developing and using AI further down the supply chain, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
The resulting compliance costs could overburden SMEs, result in legal uncertainty and stifle the adoption of AI, says a statement released by the European Digital SME Alliance, which claims to represent more than 45,000 enterprises in Europe. 
Around 99% of all businesses in the European Union are SMEs, employing around 100 million people and accounting for more than half of Europe's GDP.
Margarete Rudzki, who works at the German Confederation of Crafts and Small Businesses (ZDH), believes addressing the issue of liability is crucial for increasing both trust and adoption of AI.
""There's great potential for AI among our businesses, for instance when it comes to predictive maintenance. But it's paramount to determine who in the supply chain is actually liable for damage done, for example by high-risk AI products or systems,"" Rudzki told DW last month at the European Commission's flagship conference on SMEs in Bilbao.
""Just imagine an AI-powered garage door — the algorithm malfunctions, and it hurts the neighbor's child. Who would be liable? We need to resolve all these thorny legal questions,"" she added.
According to EU statistics agency Eurostat, only 7% of European SMEs used AI in 2021 — far from the Commission's 2030 target of 75%.
In the tiered approach versus self-regulation debate regarding foundation models, Cequence.io co-founder Martin Ragan errs on the side of Germany, France and Italy in their call for less regulation.
He thinks the reporting duties and other transparency obligations the AI Act might entail could put EU companies at a competitive disadvantage.
""My main concern is how competition in the EU could be slowed down here compared to the US,"" Ragan, who also worked in Silicon Valley for a year, told DW.
""Until you get a review or approval for a new model from EU regulators, someone in the US can come up with the same idea or copy it, get it into the market much faster and blow you out of the water. This means you could lose your entire business.""
The AI Act proposal differentiates between four risk levels: From minimal or no risk over limited risk, such as generative AI tools like ChatGPT or Google's Bard, to what lawmakers consider high-risk applications, such as border control management.
Finally, technology like facial recognition tools or social scoring pose ""unacceptable risk"" and are to be banned.
One of the aims of the Act is to protect democratic processes like elections from AI-generated deepfakes and other sources of disinformation. This is especially topical in light of next year's EU-wide elections.
Yet if policymakers can't smooth out the sticking points and agree on a finalized set of principles and rules on December 6, the AI Act could be delayed until after the 2024 election. For Europe's SMEs, a postponement would mean that their legal uncertainty around artificial intelligence continues.

https://www.dw.com/en/uk-seeks-to-revive-migrant-transfer-deal-with-rwanda/a-67641528,POLITICS,UK seeks to revive migrant transfer deal with Rwanda 05.12.2023,"The interior ministers of Britain and Rwanda on Tuesday signed an agreement aimed at reviving a failed policy aimed at relocating irregular arrivals to the UK to the East African country.
The UK government said the plan, dismissed by the opposition as unworkable, is essential for it to meet a promise to slash migration.
UK Home Secretary James Cleverly signed the agreement with his Rwandan counterpart, Vincent Biruta, saying it would ""address all the issues"" raised by the UK Supreme Court last month when it ruled that the policy was unlawful.
""There is a lot of desire to continue to improve the process. The UK and Rwanda are working on this because it is important,"" Cleverly said at a joint press briefing in Kigali.
Biruta said his country remained committed to the proposal and had no plans to withdraw support.
""Rwanda is very committed to this partnership and that is why we worked  with the UK government to address the concerns raised by the Supreme Court.""
The agreement is believed to include commitments from Rwanda about how asylum-seekers and other migrants would be treated when arriving from Britain.
The UK government hopes that these will address the concerns raised by the Supreme Court in November.
President of the Supreme Court Robert Reed said Rwanda had a history of misunderstanding its obligations to refugees and of ""refoulement"" — sending claimants back to the country they had sought protection from, even if unsafe.
""There is a real risk that asylum claims will not be determined properly, and that asylum-seekers will in consequence be at risk of being returned directly or indirectly to their country of origin,"" the judges said. ""In that event, genuine refugees will face a real risk of ill-treatment.""
A deputy spokesman for Rwanda's government said the two countries would ""set up a joint tribunal with both Rwandan and UK judges in Kigali... to make sure that none of the immigrants sent to Rwanda is deported to their country.""
The original agreement had envisaged sending to Rwanda anyone who makes ""dangerous or illegal journeys"" to Britain on small boats from Europe or hidden in lorries.
The two countries struck the deal in April 2022 for such migrants to be sent to Rwanda, where their asylum claims would be processed. If successful, they would stay in Rwanda.

The UK government claims that such deportations would discourage others from making the journeys and break the business model of people-smuggling gangs.
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak — whose party is lagging in the polls and faces an election next year — is under intense pressure to reduce net migration, which hit a record 745,000 last year. The vast majority of those came through legal routes.
Opponents of the agreement with Rwanda say it is unethical and unworkable, with the opposition Labour's home affairs spokeswoman, Yvette Cooper, dismissing it as a ""gimmick.""
The UK Home Office itself has estimated that removing every asylum-seeker to a country such as Rwanda could cost 169,000 pounds per person (about €197,000; $213,000).
Rwanda has already received an initial payment of 140 million pounds, with the promise that more money would be sent to fund the accommodation and care of any people who are deported.
The legal challenges to the UK government have prompted some on the right of the ruling Conservative Party to urge the government to leave the European Convention on Human Rights after deportation flights were originally blocked by the European Court of Human Rights.

https://www.dw.com/en/eu-approves-ban-on-destruction-of-unsold-clothing/a-67641000,CLIMATE,EU approves ban on destruction of unsold clothing 05.12.2023,"Negotiators from the European Parliament and EU member states on Tuesday reached an agreement to stop large retail groups of destroying unsold clothes and footwear.
The rules are aimed at cracking down on the impact of ""fast fashion"" and reducing waste. 
Brussels is seeking to address textile consumption in Europe, which has the fourth highest impact on the environment and climate change after food, housing and transport.
Although the ban in principle will begin after two years for large businesses, exceptions have been agreed for small companies, as well as a transitional period of six years for medium-sized companies. 
The latest agreement comes as part of a wider initiative after the European Commission proposed changes to the bloc's so-called ecodesign rules.
This would make products longer-lasting and easier to reuse, repair and recycle, reducing the consumption of resources such as energy and water.
MEP Alessandra Moretti, who spearheaded the legislation through parliament, said: ""It is time to end the model of 'take, make, dispose' that is so harmful to our planet, our health and our economy."" 
""New products will be designed in a way that benefits all, respects our planet and protects the environment.""
The Commission will also have the power to widen the ban to other unsold products beyond clothing and footwear.
Full details of requirements for individual products have not yet been finalized with parliament and member states still needing to officially approve the agreement, although that this is believed to be a formality. 
The agreement outlined that the European Commission can issue legally binding requirements to make goods such as furniture, tyres, detergents, paints and chemicals more environmentally friendly. 
Goods must also be sold with a ""digital product passport"", which could be a QR code, in order to help consumers make informed choices about their purchases.
However, numerous raw materials such as iron, steel and aluminium are also to be regulated accordingly in future. Exceptions are planned for goods such as cars and military products.

https://www.dw.com/en/countries-sign-up-to-reduce-climate-impact-of-the-cooling-sector/a-67641232,NATURE AND ENVIRONMENT,Countries sign up to reduce climate impact of the cooling sector 05.12.2023,"More than 60 countries have signed up to an agreement to slash cooling-related emissions from energy-guzzling air-conditioners and refrigerators.
The ""Global Cooling Pledge"" launched at the COP28 climate conference in Dubai calls for countries to reduce cooling sector emissions by at least 68% by 2050 compared to 2022 levels.
Cooling now makes up around a fifth of energy consumption, and as heat waves become more intense due to climate change, demand for air-conditioners and other cooling devices is set to soar. 
Emissions from the sector are expected to surge to between 4.4 billion and 6.1 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent by 2050, according to a report published on Tuesday by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) at the climate talks. 

At the same time, people will need access to life-saving cooling as temperatures rise. A recent report from the Lancet medical journal estimated that heat stress deaths could quadruple by the middle of the century.
Organizers hope at least 80 countries will sign up to the cooling pledge.
 ""The cooling sector must grow to protect everyone from rising temperatures,"" said UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen on the launch of the cooling report. ""But this growth must not come at the cost of the energy transition and more intense climate impacts."" 
More than a billion people, largely living in Africa and Asia, lack access to cooling services, putting lives at risk from extreme heat. Women are disproportionately affected. Nearly a third of the world's population is exposed to deadly heat waves more than 20 days a year.
Lack of access to refrigeration reduces farmers' incomes, drives food loss and waste, and also blocks access to vaccines and medicine that need to be placed in cold storage.  
""This access is especially important for the most vulnerable communities, who have often contributed the least to climate change but are the most exposed to its impacts,"" said COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber in a statement. 
The UNEP report outlines various measures to slash emissions from the sector, including boosting the efficiency of cooling technologies and phasing down the use of planet-heating refrigerants called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Countries also need to boost passive cooling solutions in building and urban design. 
Such measures could reduce emissions from ""business-as-usual cooling"" by more than 60% — or around 3.8 billion tons of CO2 — by 2050. It would also reduce electricity bills, save energy and allow an extra 3.5 billion people to benefit from refrigerators, air conditioners or passive cooling by mid-century, according to the report. 
Rapidly decarbonizing power grids would help reduce cooling sector emissions by up to 96%.
""Countries and the cooling sector must act now to ensure low-carbon cooling growth. Fortunately, the solutions are available today,"" said UNEP's Andersen. ""Getting energy efficient, sustainable cooling right offers an opportunity to cut global warming, improve the lives of hundreds of millions of people, and realize huge financial savings.""

https://www.dw.com/en/why-are-fewer-chinese-tourists-visiting-thailand/a-67637283,BUSINESS,Why are fewer Chinese tourists visiting Thailand? 05.12.2023,"Chinese tourist arrivals in Thailand are set to be lower than forecast in 2023, according to estimates by the Thai tourism bureau.
Thailand had expected a bump in tourist arrivals from China following the reopening of borders after the coronavirus pandemic. The tourism bureau initially predicted 5 million visitors from China in 2023.
However, arrivals from China before December numbered around 3 million, and the year-end total is now estimated to be around 3.5 million visitors.
Vincent Zhuang, a journalist from China and former editor at the Robb Report, a luxury-lifestyle magazine, said Chinese travel trends are changing.
""The Chinese tourist has changed a lot,"" Zhuang told DW. He added that Chinese tourists are traveling more domestically as air fares and hotel prices remain high elsewhere in Asia.
""There are many choices in China both for luxury and economy tourists,"" he said.
China's economic problems, which includes a real estate crisis, a worsening job market and record-high youth unemployment, also contribute to people thinking twice about traveling overseas.
With spending power being reduced, the number of international flights connecting China to Thailand is still not back to pre-pandemic levels, officials say.
Chinatown in Bangkok is a hot spot for international tourists, with bustling food stalls, authentic Chinese dishes, and bright neon-lit signs. Masses of tourists from mainland China are often seen in group tours roaming these streets.
However, shop owners and market vendors in Bangkok's Chinatown told DW that the number of Chinese tourists this year is lower than before.
In another popular tourist location, the island of Phuket in southern Thailand, hotel bookings from China are also lower than anticipated.
""China pre-pandemic used to be one of our top countries … I think almost 18% to 20% of our business was coming from China, heavily dependent on tour groups,"" said Ranjeet Viswanathan, director of sales & marketing at the Hyatt Regency Phuket Resort.
""But right now, China makes up for about 5% of my business,"" he told DW. 
In a shooting at the Siam Paragon shopping mall in Bangkok in September, three people were killed including one Chinese national. The news of the shooting led to around 60,000 Chinese tourists canceling their trips to Thailand, according to Thai officials.
And the Chinese blockbuster movie ""No More Bets,"" which was released in August, did not paint Thailand in a positive light.
The movie tells the story of Chinese citizens who are tricked into taking a work trip overseas only to be forced into operating illegal gambling and cryptocurrency scams in an unnamed Southeast Asian country.
But indirect references to Thailand are present in the film, such as one scene showing a road sign named ""Sukhumvit,"" which is a well-known district in Bangkok.
The movie was seen as a reminder of incessant telecom scams in China.
Nithee Seeprae, deputy governor at the Tourism Authority of Thailand admitted more work needs to be done to show that Thailand welcomes Chinese arrivals. 
""According to our travel partners in China, tourists still trust in Thailand as a safe destination. But maybe we'll have to coordinate with Chinese influencers, and the Chinese influencer network in Thailand,"" he told DW. 

The Thai government has also tried to make it easier for Chinese visitors to enter Thailand.
Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin announced in September that Chinese tourists can enter Thailand from mainland China for 30 days, without requiring a visa up until the end of February.
""The measure is long overdue if Thailand wants to attract more Chinese visitors,"" said Gary Bowerman, an Asia tourism analyst based in Malaysia. 
It's clear Thailand is trying desperately hard to re-coup the benefits of Chinese tourism, which has been a boost to its economy.
Thailand's tourist economy accounted for 11.5% of the country's overall GDP in 2019.
Of the record 39 million foreign arrivals that year, over 11 million were Chinese visitors. But following the pandemic in 2022, Thailand welcomed just 11 million international visitors, with China only accounting for 273,567 of those arrivals. 
With 3.5 million Chinese arrivals estimated to visit for 2023, Thai officials have predicted a stronger recovery from the Chinese market, forecasting over double the amount to over 8 million arrivals in 2024.
However, Bowerman told DW that existing factors this year could still contribute to obstacles for Chinese tourism to return to previous levels next year.
This year ""has proved to be a very tricky year to forecast Chinese outbound demand for Southeast Asian destinations like Thailand,"" he said.
""Thailand will be hoping for more stable and predictable demand patterns for Chinese arrivals, and overall growth is expected in 2024,"" he added.
""However, forecasting a precise figure at the moment, with airlines nervous about adding back capacity, is a bit like waving your finger in the wind,"" said tourism analyst Bowerman.

https://www.dw.com/en/nigeria-legend-jay-jay-okocha-bundesliga-can-grow-in-africa/a-67638012,SOCCER,Nigeria legend Jay-Jay Okocha: Bundesliga can grow in Africa 05.12.2023,"The Bundesliga needs to do more to win hearts and achieve growth in the African market, according to former Nigeria midfielder Austin ""Jay-Jay"" Okocha.
""People didn't know how good the Bundesliga is because they failed for decades to market the Bundesliga [to Africa],"" Okocha, who serves as an ambassador for Germany's top division, told DW during a media roundtable over the weekend.
This year marked 30 years since Okocha scored his famous goal of the season for Eintracht Frankfurt against Karlsruhe and their legendary goalkeeper, Oliver Kahn.

""I am delighted now that they have realized they must reach out because that is what the Premier League did.
""When it comes to entertainment and good football, the [Bundesliga] is up there. Because people didn't get to watch the Bundesliga week in and week out before, they didn't understand how good the Bundesliga is. But I'm really delighted now and happy to be part of reaching out to the market.""
Okocha is part of a Bundesliga visit to Johannesburg this week, where the league will celebrate its 60th anniversary with events including match screenings. But the Bundesliga has yet to open an African office.
According to the DFL, 22 African players currently play in the Bundesliga, and 53 others have connections to the continent through at least one of their parents. African players have been thriving in the Bundesliga since Ghana's Ibrahim Sunday made a 45-minute appearance for Werder Bremem in 1976.  
But a visit by DW to some Bundesliga clubs last weekend showed that many still have not committed to the African market.
Former Bundesliga champion Borussia Mönchengladbach has had many African players in its 123-year history. The club has set up academies in China and Singapore. Still, its sole outreach to Africa was the donation of the team's shirts to a children's club during a Bundesliga event in Nigeria. 
""Right now, we are talking about touch points for different countries, and we are talking to several potential partners in Africa, but it has not come to the point that we can cooperate with them,"" Denise Pörtner, manager of global partnerships at Gladbach, told DW.
""The continent of Africa is a target for the Bundesliga, so it shows that it is really important for German football, and so we are thinking of how we can find a touch point for Africa,"" she said.
Current Bundesliga leader Bayer Leverkusen has five African players in their first team. Yet they don't have any academies in an African country.
""The business of sport is also finding good players,"" Simon Rolfes, the club's sporting director, told DW. ""We are looking at the African market and players playing in Europe. We have a good scouting department, and they are checking the market, and I think Africa will become more and more important for this.""
In April, Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich signed a five-year partnership with tourism group Visit Rwanda. Despite criticism in Germany, it showed opportunities in the African market beyond sporting talent.
""The African continent offers fantastic opportunities and, with the right strategy, many prospects and possibilities for Bundesliga clubs, regardless of the many talents that come from Africa,"" Sebastian Schächter, of sports consultancy Schächter Sports, told DW.
""However, building up the market environment and sufficient business opportunities in Africa requires time and perseverance for clubs. The return on investment is much faster in Asia or North America.""
Schächter has represented third-division side DSC Arminia Bielefeld in its partnership with South African second-tier club, Maritzburg United. This relationship was built on the back of former South African national team players Delroy Buckley and Sibusiso Zuma, who once played for Bielefeld.
""With a long-term youth training program in Johannesburg, coach training measures, many CSR (corporate social responsibility) measures and cooperation with the Chamber of Foreign Trade of Southern Africa and Maritzburg United, DSC Arminia has succeeded in generating a sustainable and credible impact that has had an extremely positive effect on the brand and now offers great opportunities,"" said Schächter.
Okocha, and many in Africa, are waiting for Bundesliga clubs to follow suit.

https://www.dw.com/en/mali-burkina-faso-and-niger-alliance-faces-uphill-task/a-67632987,TERRORISM,"Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger alliance faces uphill task 05.12.2023","All three countries, led by militaries that seized power from civilian leaders, officially withdrew from the G5 Sahel Joint Force, a body set up to fight Islamists in the Sahel region, on December 2.
The region has been characterized by extremism since 2014. Violence against civilians has triggered a humanitarian crisis, which has left more than 24 million people requiring assistance.
The G5 anti-jihadist force was created in 2014 in Nouakchott, Mauritania. It originally had Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Nigeras members.
Chad and Mauritania are still part of the G5 force, but the exit of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has virtually collapsed the alliance. Burkina Faso and Niger, who joined Mali to exit the coalition, gave a damming assessment of the G5.
""The organization is failing to achieve its objectives. Worse, the legitimate ambitions of our countries of making the G5 Sahel a zone of security and development are hindered by institutional red tape from a previous era, which convinces us that our process of independence and dignity is not compatible with G5 participation in its current form,"" they said in a statement.
However, security expert Adib Saani told DW that forming a new security pact between the three countries doesn't stand a chance of success.
""It would be very difficult for the new confederation to achieve any results, owing to the fact that these countries are already reeling under pressure by terrorist groups,"" Saani said.
The so-called Alliance of Sahel States (AES) by the three countries was signed in September this year, but Saani said nothing suggests that the new alliance would have the capacity to offer much.
""In Mali, the government is fighting three fronts. In Niger, we have seen the number of attacks spiraling out of control since the withdrawal of the French contingent. Burkina Faso, which is the second most impacted country by terrorism according to the terrorism global index for last year, is also fighting to hold onto the comparatively little land that they have or remaining,"" Saani explained, adding that each of the three countries was busy carrying its own cross.
""I don't think there is going to be anything meaningful coming out of it as they [Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso] are all already overstretched.""

The three countries have broken ties with their former colonial master, France, which had a significant role in the G5 Sahel group. 
""The G5 Sahel cannot serve foreign interests to the detriments of our people, and even less the dictates of any power in the name of a partnership that treats them like children, denying the sovereignty of our peoples,"" they said in their statement in a veiled reference to France.
Mutaru Mumuni Muktar, executive director of the West Africa Center for Counter Extremism, said he was not surprised by the posture and stance of the three junta-led nations.
""In all the three countries, there's a strong anti-French sentiment and this has been building on over time,"" Muktar told DW.
Niger has also ended its security agreements with Western nations and has increasingly turned to Russia.
Niger's foreign affairs ministry said in a memo that his country has decided to ""withdraw the privileges and immunities granted"" under the EU Military Partnership Mission in Niger.
That partnership was launched in February this year, months before the recent coup, but with the latest move, Niger said it ""has no legal obligation"" related to that partnership.
According to Muktar, mere resentment for France and the West won't make the three countries strong enough to fight the current insurgency.
""It makes sense [to form a new alliance] in terms of protection of their own regimes and as a deterrent for them to form this kind of alliance, but in terms of how effective this alliance could be against violence extremism remains to be seen."" 

Under the new charter, the three countries pledged to fight terrorism and organized crime.
However, Muktar said the three nations lacked the capacity and infrastructure to accomplish their mission. 
""They do not have enough funding,"" Muktar said, stressing that the three countries do not have a sustainable economic model to sustain their goal.
""They do not have enough goodwill from the local population and other actors locally to deal with that. And so I don't see how far this would go…in dealing with violent extremism.""
The three nations remain suspended from the regional bloc ECOWAS and relations have deteriorated for months.
Saani said these countries should prioritize restoring relations with ECOWAS to access the needed global support to fight the prevailing insecurity.
""It [the insecurity in the Sahel] would only get worse; that is the bad news, and no amount of confederation can stop what is going on,"" Saani added.
Some 4.9 million people have already been displaced due to the current crisis. 
The UN has stressed the urgent need to strengthen support and advance the fight against terrorism in the region.
The military coups haven't helped matters either, according to Bram Posthumus, a journalist who reports on Africa's Sahel region.
He told DW that since soldiers took over in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, the security situation in those countries has worsened.
The coups ""have given adversaries, the non-state armed groups the opportunity to increase their influence and their reach in the areas they control,"" Posthumus said.
Saani agreed that the current disjointed security strategies in the region are failing to combat the terrorists effectively.
""There is no denying the fact that we are failing in countering the threats and it is also important to understand that the terrorists are winning the war,"" he added.

https://www.dw.com/en/remaking-globalization-the-helmut-schmidt-lecture-2023-in-berlin/a-67604364,GLOBALIZATION,Does Germany need to rethink globalization? 05.12.2023,"Globalization has had a rough time lately. Worldwide, just-in-time supply chains suffered under stiff tariffs. COVID-19 shutdowns and travel restrictions caused further distress. Now, the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russian companies are making matters even worse. Inflation and price increases have made energy and food more expensive. Ordinary customers, especially the poor, are suffering.
Is the world order falling apart? Is the status quo even worth saving? The world is changing, and our understanding of globalization must change, too, according to Moritz Schularick, president of Germany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
The focus of globalization can no longer be on squeezing the greatest possible profit from global value chains. It must also take into account ""their reliability and their political implications,"" he wrote in a publication accompanying a discussion organized by the Federal Chancellor Helmut Schmidt Foundation (BKHS). ""It will be a new world economic order compared to what we have been used to for the last 30 years, and it will challenge us.""
In other words, while still enjoying many of the benefits of globalization, countries must avoid becoming too dependent on — or vulnerable to — trading with countries that are not close friends, something that Russia's war in Ukraine has shown a spotlight on.
Germany, in particular, made three big bets that are not paying off as planned, says Schularick: continued growth through Chinese trade, cheap energy from Russia, and minimal defense spending under America's protective umbrella.
All three of these are coming back to haunt Europe's biggest economy now, he argues. Still, there is room for hope as Germany has great potential to improve in many areas. Importantly, it must look forward, not backward.
The lecture on December 4 at the Museum of Communication Berlin brought together a big audience to talk about the complicated issue. Schularick, who is also a professor of economics, led the discussion that focused on renewable energy, China, and closer European business integration.
The time for cheap Russian gas is over. Germany and the rest of Europe must concentrate on building up renewable energy capabilities. In the meantime, new, non-Russian sources of energy must be secured to keep things running. Not only will this be better for the environment, as COP28 delegates in Dubai are currently discussing. Clean energy is also often local energy.
More complicated is Germany's relationship with China. Schularick encourages government officials to take a closer look at their foreign and security policies. They should be clearer about who are friends and who are not.
China poses a great challenge, not so much because it is so strong, but because its economy has weakened under a number of setbacks. This means fewer Chinese companies buying high-tech German exports. It also means China will likely turn to its own manufacturers as a way to grow and export its way to out of problems. This will make it a direct competitor to Germany, says Schularick. For German companies doing business in China ""the fat years are over.""
To counter this, Germany and the rest of the EU need to come together. This includes more digitalization, and strengthening the European Banking Union. The internal European market also needs to be liberalized and allowed to grow faster. It is a huge market, it just needs to be put to better use.
A single business, or even a whole branch of industry, can't make much headway alone. To make a real difference, businesses need to work with governments to plan for success, says Schularick.
This is a timely warning as many estimates about Germany's 2024 gross domestic product (GDP) growth come in at under 1%. But how can people be convinced about the need for radical change?
""I think we need a better network between academia and politics,"" Schularick told DW, ""especially for these global issues."" Precisely here he sees Berlin lagging behind locations like London, Paris, or Washington. Germany has many rules to avoid crisis, but is not prepared with crisis management skills to deal when a crisis actually arises, he says.
""We have to build up this intellectual infrastructure in Berlin, with think tanks, with media, with research and science, so that we can better anticipate what is happening in the world in the future.""
This may seem a bit abstract. More concretely, a reorganization of globalization could mean having or bringing home some manufacturing production capacity to ensure supplies. It could also mean leaving behind some energy-intensive industries.
For companies, it means diversification in terms of where to produce and sell goods or services, while also securing sources of raw materials. These are all big changes that would upend decades of interdependence.
Still, Schularick is hopeful. Over the past two decades, globalization delivered on economic progress, and though it could have done better, many people enjoyed its benefits.
Yet, the world is not more peaceful or stable than 20 years ago. And it is this failure that needs rebalancing. In the future, there will have to be a tradeoff between efficiency and security. The question is: ""What price are we willing to pay for less efficiency?""

https://www.dw.com/en/global-shipping-on-alert-after-houthis-attack-vessels/a-67549872,BUSINESS,Global shipping on alert after Houthis attack vessels 04.12.2023,"A major escalation in maritime attacks in the Middle East unfolded this weekend when ballistic missiles fired by Yemen's Houthi rebels struck three commercial ships Sunday in the Red Sea.
A week earlier, the Iran-backed Houthis seized a Japanese-operated cargo ship in the Red Sea, with armed men jumping onto its deck from a helicopter before hoisting Palestinian and Yemeni flags. 
The Marine Traffic tracking site said the empty car carrier, which was owned by Israeli busisnessman Abraham Ungar, left Korfez in Turkey and was on its way to Pipavav in India when it went offline southwest of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
The ship's operator, Japan's Nippon Yusen, said it had set up a taskforce to collect information on the 25-person crew, who are from the Philippines, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania and Mexico. 
Though no Israelis were on board, Israel called the incident an ""Iranian act of terrorism"" and said it would have ""grave consequences"" for international maritime security. 
In the months before the Israel-Hamas war started on October 7, the number of hijackings had been increasing after a lull in the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman, mainly due to US-Iranian tensions and restrictions on the trade of Iranian oil.
""This is part of a tit-for-tat war between the US, UK and Iran, and could draw other countries in. Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy want to influence the geopolitical scene and show they control the Straits of Hormuz,"" said Dimitris Maniatis, COO of private maritime security company Seagull Maritime.
In April and May, Iranian naval forces seized three internationally flagged oil tankers in response to US seizures of tankers allegedly carrying Iranian oil as part of sanctions enforcement operations. 
In another incident on November 26, the US Navy reportedly captured five pirates who had attempted to hijack the Central Park, a tanker run by an Israeli businessman, in the Gulf of Aden near Somalia.
The International Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting Center noted 115 incidents of global piracy and armed robbery attacks in 2022, less than the previous year.
Half of the 2022 attacks on ships took place in Southeast Asia, with the Straits of Singapore particularly vulnerable. Other areas of concern include South and Central America and the seas around Nigeria, Ghana and Angola.
Experts predict such incidents will continue.
""We expect to see this happening again. They showed they can do it, and they seek media attention. They have info on Israeli ships. They know what they are doing. Israeli-connected vessels will be targets. It's very simple to track,"" said Maniatis.
In fact, Houthi rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi said the group was looking for Israeli vessels in the Red Sea — even those without Israeli flags.
""This is nothing new, it's only big news because the Houthis did it,"" said Maniatis. ""From 2019 onward in the Strait of Hormuz the same tactics were used by the Iranians. Houthis are a proxy for Tehran against Israel and others.""
Houthis control much of the western Yemen coast and overlook a large stretch of the Red Sea and the narrow Bab el-Mandeb Strait, some of the world's busiest waterways. Still, they need support. 
""Houthis have not resorted to hijackings in recent years. In the Red Sea and the Gulf Aden, the main risk facing commercial vessels remains piracy, of an opportunistic, criminal nature,"" said Harish Natarajan, head of economic analysis at AKE International, a security risk consultancy in London.
""The seizure of the Galaxy Leader was politically motivated. As such the threat to merchant shipping as a whole is low, and this is likely to remain the case due to the very specific nature of the targeting of these vessels,"" John Stawpert of the International Chamber of Shipping told DW.
Based on the recent case of the oil tanker Heroic Idun, which also belongs to Abraham Ungar, specialists said a payment of $1-1.5 million (€950,000-€1.35 million) might be the asking price for the ship's safe return.
But predictions are a fool's game, given that about a third of all daily shipping in the world passes the northeast corner of Africa, where the sea narrows to a point between Yemen and Djibouti on its way to the Suez Canal and the Red Sea. 
Natarajan says the risk of attack is likely to mirror developments in Gaza, whereby an escalation of Israeli operations against the Palestinians would likely prompt an increase in the risk of attacks targeting Israeli ships and perhaps extending to US and Western assets.
Overall, the UN has estimated that piracy costs the global shipping trade up to $12 billion a year. About 10% of global seaborne petroleum trade goes through the Gulf of Aden, the waterway between Yemen and the Horn of Africa, according to the US Energy Information Administration.
To date, insurers have not changed their practices, said Stawpert. ""Similarly, the specific nature of the incident means that the overall threat to shipping is low, and it is therefore very unlikely to result in significant rerouting of vessels from the Red Sea.""
""The extreme case is that of the Black Sea. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the cost of insuring a vessel and its cargo rose up to 10% of its total value,"" Natarajan said .
""We don't expect any contraction of sea trade, just security, and thus costs, being increased,"" Maniatis believes. ""Most vessels, after all, have no Israeli connection.""

https://www.dw.com/en/congos-election-woes-under-western-scrutiny/a-67345427,POLITICS,Congo's election woes under Western scrutiny 03.12.2023,"The process of organizing this month's general election in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Africa's fourth most populous country, has been called ""ill prepared"" and ""troubled"" by some analysts.
It's taking place against the backdrop of flaring rebel violence in Congo's east that has already displaced 6.9 million people, as well as a shrinking space for dissent and accusations that Congo's electoral commission (CENI) is biased towards the incumbent, Felix Tshisekedi. 
Western nations have shown differing levels of unease about the situation in Congo — which is strategically located in central Africa and shares borders with nine countries — and the integrity of its electoral process.

Two US lawmakers wrote an open letter to Tshisekedi in early November, calling on him to guarantee that the presidential, legislative and regional elections scheduled for December 20 are ""free and fair.""
In the letter, Senator Chris Coons and Congressman Michael McCaul, who is chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, expressed their concern about the ""lack of transparency surrounding the electoral process so far"" and increasing reports of attacks and harassment of political figures and detentions of civil society activists.
CENI, which says it has registered 43.9 million voters, has failed to publish the final voter roll or allow it to be audited.
Last week, six opposition candidates asked the country's Constitutional Court to compel the electoral commission to publish the electoral roll, warning of potential irregularities and fraud.
Numerous rights organizations, both international and local, have decried the rise in political persecutions in the run up to the elections — while local press rights group Journaliste en Danger warned last week that reporters were increasingly under attack.
In October, CENI president Denis Kadima even met with US officials in Washington as part of a campaign to dispel concerns about the commission's past record.
A State Department spokesperson told Reuters news agency at the time that the US government remained concerned about ""possible violence, threats to press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly, and attempts by certain parties to manipulate the vote.""
Just before campaigning began on November 19, the US embassy in Congo ""saluted"" the certification of 26 presidential candidates and also ""noted actions by authorities to uphold the freedom of movement of political candidates.""
Researcher and Congo expert Jason Stearns said that while there are those in Washington who care deeply about the dire humanitarian situation in Congo, he believes the US is increasingly focused on the impoverished nation because it is worried that most of Congo's mining exports flow to China.
As well as having major deposits of copper, gold and diamonds, Congo is home to the world's largest reserves of cobalt, a key component in batteries for electric cars and mobile phones.
""Much of [Congo's] mining sector is now owned by China and almost all of these minerals are shipped out to China,"" said Stearns, founder of the Congo Research Group at New York University.
""The United States has become increasingly worried and concerned about this as tensions with China are ratcheted up.""
The EU Council issued a strongly worded statement in July about Congo's election preparations. While it noted CENI's ""sustained work,"" the statement highlighted criticisms and concerns made by the opposition and civil society in Congo.
""Ensuring the full integrity of the electoral process requires freedom of speech, media, assembly, association, and movement. Any excessive or disproportionate use of force in response to peaceful demonstrations or arbitrary detentions is incompatible with this requirement,"" the statement said.
The EU planned, however, to deploy a long-term election observer mission to Congo upon Tshisekedi's invitation.
Although these plans have since cancelled because of security concerns, agreeing to send observers is a turnaround from the 2018 elections when the government of then president, Joseph Kabila, refused to accept EU election monitors.

The team of around 40 observers flew to Congo but were ""unable to deploy throughout the country due to security reasons,"" the EU said in a statement released on November 29.
""Due to technical constraints beyond the EU's control, we are forced to cancel the election observation mission,"" it said, adding that essential telecommunications equipment had not been made available to the observers deployed in the country.
This made the long-term observation ""impossible.""
The EU is reportedly exploring other options, including having a mission of electoral experts to observe the electoral process from Kinshasa.
The Tshisekedi government said it regretted the EU's decision.
However, Congo has reportedly yet to approve the accreditation of the EU's new ambassador, leaving the diplomatic position empty at a pivotal time.
""In general, most European countries are aligning themselves with the Commission's position on monitoring and supporting the electoral process in the DRC,"" Bob Kabamba, a political scientist at the University of Liege in Belgium, told DW.
France, he said, is ""keeping a low profile"" when it comes to Congo to avoid sparking ""more anti-French sentiment in other African countries.""
As for Belgium, said Kabamba, the former colonial power originally supported Tshisekedi, who assumed power after the 2018 election widely perceived to have been won by another candidate. But, he said, the ""shortcomings"" of the election preparations on top of Tshisekedi ""breaking many promises"" when it comes to improving governance and tackling corruption mean Belgium has ""slowly begun to take a lukewarm view of the Tshisekedi regime and also of the electoral process.""
Despite its mineral wealth, Congo is among the five poorest nations in the world. In 2022, 62% of Congolese, around 60 million people, lived on less than $2.15 (€2.00) a day, according to the World Bank. This makes the country particularly dependent on Western aid.
""Tshisekedi has spent a large part of his presidency outside of the country, courting and negotiating with these donors,"" pointed out researcher and author Jason Stearns. ""So there's a perception that these donors are very important,"" something he is sure the EU was able to ""leverage"" to deploy their observers.
On the other hand, said Nick Elebe, a Congo-based special advisor at the Open Society Africa, most Western countries have limited leverage on the election process because they aren't funding it directly.
He sees in Congo the same fatigue towards Western powers, who are seen as acting hypocritically, particularly in their failure to rebuke neighboring Rwanda for its support of M23 rebels fighting in eastern Congo.
Although Rwanda denies supporting the M23 rebels, investigations by the United Nations, among other organizations, provide ""solid evidence"" that it does.
Tshisekedi's government was also hoping for more investment and business from Western countries, he said, to reduce its reliance on aid.
""This is the reason why Congo is turning again to others, like China or Russia,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/as-economy-tanks-turkish-companies-eye-egypt/a-67606182,BUSINESS,"As economy tanks, Turkish companies eye Egypt 02.12.2023","Relations between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, have been icy for years.
When democratically elected Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi was removed from office by then General Abdel Fattah el-Sissi in 2013, Erdogan immediately sided with the jailed Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated leader, calling el-Sissi a putschist, murderer and tyrant.
Erdogan adopted the Muslim Brotherhood's signature hand gesture and often dismissively referred to Turkish opposition politicians as el-Sissis in an expression of loathing for the new Egyptian president.
Egypt, in turn, accused Turkey of supporting the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood and granting safe haven to its members.
The countries supported opposing sides in the Libya conflict.
Egypt and Turkey were also in disagreement over the extraction of gas in the Mediterranean Sea.
But, despite these differences, a thaw in Egyptian-Turkish ties is now happening as the world endures multiple crises and both countries' economies continue to struggle.
A year ago, Egyptian and Turkish business delegations met for the first time in nine years. Since then, ties have been growing ever stronger.
Turkish companies have been unhappy with the state of the Turkish economy for years, as President Erdogan's low interest rate policies have continued to drive up inflation, which is officially 61.5% right now. High fuel costs and uncertainty over central bank interest rate policies have compounded the problem.
Turkey's new finance minister, Mehmet Simsek; and the new head of the Central Bank of the Turkish Republic, Hafize Gaye Erkan, have also been unable to create stability — despite initiating a return to conventional economic policy. Both say the Turkish economy will regain stability and return to single-digit inflation rates in 2025 or 2026. Many companies, however, are unwilling to put up with such uncertainty.

Turkish companies face growing production costs, high fuel prices, and unpredictable foreign exchange and interest rate policies. Quite a few are therefore thinking about relocating abroad.
Egypt, for example, offers far lower labor and production costs than Turkey. What's more, in April, Egypt removed the need for Turkish citizens to acquire a visa before entering the country.
So far, Turkish investments in Egypt this year have totaled $2.5 billion (€2.2 billion). It is estimated they could grow to $3 billion (€2.7 billion) by the end of 2023.
Turkish companies operating in Egypt also have the opportunity to engage in tariff-free trade with third-party countries, allowing them to tap into new markets.
""Egypt was already an attractive country for doing business, but lifting the visa requirement for Turkish citizens marked a real turning point,"" the chairman of the Turkish-Egyptian Business Council, Mustafa Denizer, told DW. Turkish companies had been looking to move to other countries for many years in a bid to remain competitive, said Denizer, adding, ""With the [Egyptian] visa-free regime in place, there is now great momentum [for them to move there].""
Today, 35 Turkish industrial enterprises are operating out of Egypt and generating an annual turnover of more than $1.5 billion (€1.3 billion), the expert said.
Turkish companies based in Egypt could tap into a range of different markets, thanks to free-trade deals with US, EU, South America and some African countries, according to Denizer.
In Turkey, average monthly labor costs are around $500 (€459) per worker — in Egypt, labor costs are a pittance of that at a mere $150 (€137). Fuel costs are also far lower in Egypt. That is why major Turkish companies like Arcelik, Sisecam, Temsa and Yildiz Holding have already moved production there.
Temsa, for example, makes buses and vans in Egypt and exports them to the rest of the world, according to the company. Yildiz Holding's local confectionery brand Pladis is enjoying great success on the Egyptian market, the second largest in the Middle East/North Africa (MENA) region. Yesim Textil, in turn, operates apparel factories in Cairo, Alexandria and Ismailia, supplying its goods to many world-famous sports brands. Electrical giant Arcelik, known in Europe for its Beko brand, recently invested $100 million (€91 million) in a new Egyptian factory slated to begin operating by the end of the year. Iskefe Holding, LC Waikiki, Eroglu Group and many others have also announced additional investments.
Some 70,000 people in Egypt already work for Turkish companies, not counting those employed by suppliers. A third of all textiles and clothes in Egypt are now produced in Turkish factories.
Denizer, who works in the textile industry, says Turkish companies are receiving a warm welcome in Egypt. ""Our companies are very well received and looked after there.""
Turkish companies do, however, face a foreign currency shortage in Egypt. This shortage of dollars means Turkish companies producing goods for Egypt's domestic market often receive delayed payments. The Turkish and Egyptian central banks are currently negotiating a resolution to the problem, Denizer told DW.
In October, Turkish Minister of Trade Ömer Polat and a business delegation traveled to Egypt. Ibrahim Burkay, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in the economically potent city of Bursa, accompanied him.
""Our goal is to increase Egyptian-Turkish trade volume to $15 billion (€13.7 billion) in the next five years,"" Burkay said. Last year, it totaled $7 billion (€6.4 billion).
Bursa companies are focusing on two sectors in particular: the automotive and textile industries, according to Burkay. ""We also have the opportunity to cooperate with Egyptian companies in other countries,"" he added. Burkay said he sees great potential in Egyptian trade fairs, too. ""We can benefit from many years of experience in this field,"" said Burkay, adding that plans for a large textiles and fabric trade fair were already in the works.

Anyone who's been on X, formerly Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or TikTok knows the feeling: Before we realize it, ""a quick peek"" can easily become an hour or two of doom scrolling. Social media is everywhere. We can access it through our phones, on our computers, at work, or during our free time. We use it to chat, to post, to stay up-to-date, to follow the latest gosssip, to hear what others have to say.
But social media has its dark sides. The number of people consuming excessive amounts of social media content is rising. Over 6% of Germany's youth, or about 600,000 girls and boys, are addicted to social media and gaming. That's according to a study by German health insurer DAK and the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), published this spring. It found that over two million minors used social media or streaming platforms in ways it labeled, ""problematic."" Accordingly, the amount of time children and young adults spend in front of a screen has risen sharply compared to pre-pandemic levels, up to about two hours and 45 minutes a day on social media alone.

So are social media just another dangerous contraption? ""At the very least, their role is ambivalent,"" said Tobias Dienlin, assistant professor for interactive communication at the University of Vienna in Austria. ""There is a lot of trivial content, but some of it can also be beneficial."" 
The expert added: ""You can use social media in many different ways. You can passively consume content, or you can actively engage with social media to communicate and maintain relationships.""
As long as this happens in moderation, everything is fine, he said. Things only become problematic, he cautioned, when users start excessively frequenting social media sites.
To date, there is no precise medical definition of social media addiction. ""But just because a diagnosis doesn't exist, doesn't mean the phenomenon doesn't exist,"" said Dienlin. The media expert explained that excessive social media consumption became an addiction when users weren't able to get around to other important things in their lives, when they had the desire to use social media less but found themselves unable to think about anything else, and when they started neglecting real-life social relationships.
Most social media platforms exploit peoples' neurological hardwiring by offering a system of short-term rewards. Likes and emojis provide positive reinforcement, and any unpleasant content can easily be swiped away.
""Introducing the possibility to scroll endlessly has meant that users never finish browsing. There's always new content to see,"" Dienlin said. ""Of course that's extremely addictive, because it means users have to actively disengage from their screens. When I finish reading a book, then I'm done. All television shows come to an end. But that's not the case online.""
What's more, many social media platforms run on algorithms designed to tailor the content we see to our personal preferences. This makes it even harder to control how much we consume.
Those who struggle in other areas of their lives are particularly vulnerable to media addiction. ""People who already have weak impulse control, or who struggle to organize their daily lives, have an even harder time with social media,"" Dienlin said.
To people who are lonely, or depressed, consuming excessive amounts of social media can also be a welcome escape from reality.
""In these cases, it helps us regulate our mood and exit uncomfortable situations,"" the expert explained. ""If I'm feeling bored, or overwhelmed, or if I'm feeling ashamed and guilty, and then I reach for my phone and open social media, it's all gone. In an instant.""
On the other hand, excessive social media consumption can also worsen existing psychological conditions, such as depression or eating disorders. This can happen when users seek out certain harmful content, which algorithms then learn to present more frequently in accordance with the users' stated preferences.
In the United States, hundreds of families have now joined a class action lawsuit against four of the world's largest tech firms. They blame Facebook operator Meta, Chinese TikTok operator ByteDance, Google and YouTube operator Alphabet, and Snapchat operator Snap for not only disregarding the risk of children becoming addicted to social media, but also actively promoting it.
Several school districts have also filed suit. Among other things, the plaintiffs claim companies have insufficiently enforced parental controls and age-verification systems, and made it unnecessarily difficult to delete social media accounts.
It was long unclear if the lawsuit would proceed, as the defendants denied all accusations, brushing them off as unsubstantiated. But in mid-November, a US district court judge rejected the social media giants' bid to throw out the case.
But how meaningful might the case be? Dienlin is unsure: ""A lawsuit like this attracts a lot of attention. The way I see it, it's not irrelevant to point these things out. But, as is so often the case, there are two sides to the story. If providers want to make their services more attractive, which any profit-oriented business aims to do, then they of course automatically raise the potential risk for addiction. But users can't deny their responsibility. We have to do both: optimize technology, and also train and help users.""
The EU has meanwhile launched investigations into YouTube and TikTok, too, on suspicion of violations against child protection regulations.
Above all, the expert recommended users remain vigilant about their own social media habits, as well as those of their children. ""It's good to discuss it as a family, and to practice abstinence, without immediately resorting to thinking that all social media is absolute hogwash.""
He also recommended restricting time spent on social media, and physically putting phones aside occassionally. It's important for users to rediscover alternatives to their smartphones, too. Dienlin suggested physical activity, pursuing a hobby, meeting friends, or volunteering.
""It would be wrong to assume that social media networks are to blame for us feeling down. Oftentimes, being glued to one's phone is indicative of a wider problem. But it can cause more problems,"" he explained. Even just realizing this, he said, could be the first step out of social media addiction.

https://www.dw.com/en/philippines-opens-south-china-sea-monitoring-base/a-67609055,POLITICS,Philippines opens South China Sea monitoring base 01.12.2023,"The Philippines opened a coast guard base on the contested island of Thitu on Friday, fully equipped to monitor passing vessels in the South China Sea.
Manila says the base will monitor the behavior of Chinese ships and aircraft in the waterway, accusing Beijing of seeking to bully it over the Spratly archipelago.
Earlier this year, the Philippine Coast Guard said it had spotted a Chinese navy ship and dozens of militia vessels near the island, which is Manila's main strategic outpost in the South China Sea.
Staff at the three-story facility will use radar, satellite communication, and cameras to observe the surrounding waters.
Confrontations between Chinese and Philippine ships have intensified this year with fears that such standoffs could lead to a larger conflict. In October, Beijing and Manila traded blame over two collisions near the Second Thomas Shoal, part of the Spratly archipelago.
""The behavior of the Chinese Coast Guard, People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy and Chinese militias are sometimes unpredictable,"" Eduardo Ano, the Philippine national security adviser, said while visiting the island for the inauguration.
""They do not adhere to the international order, to the rule of law,"" he told reporters.

Ano said Chinese vessels had engaged in ""illegal"" and ""aggressive"" behavior towards Filipino fishermen and patrol boats.
""These systems will greatly enhance the PCG's ability to monitor the movements of the Chinese maritime forces, other countries that might be coming here, and also as well as our own public vessels and aircraft,"" he added.
Thitu, locally known as Pag-asa, lies about 300 miles (480 kilometers) west of the Philippine province of Palawan and is home to some 200 people. Manila uses it to maintain its territorial claim to the surrounding area.
China claims most of the South China Sea, including some islands and waters near the shores of its neighbors and far from the Chinese mainland. It has built artificial islands and military bases in the area to reinforce its stance.
Alongside the Philippines and China, other countries with rival claims to parts of the maritime area include Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam.
The busy waterway is a conduit for goods in excess of $3 trillion (some €2.75 trillion) every year.

https://www.dw.com/en/vietnam-reels-from-historic-114-billion-corruption-scandal/a-67606137,BUSINESS,Vietnam reels from historic €11.4 billion corruption scandal 01.12.2023,"Vietnam has been rocked by its largest corruption scandal to date after authorities last month arrested a prominent real estate developer over allegedly embezzling nearly €11.4 billion ($12.4 billion), the equivalent of more than 3% of the country's GDP.
In 2016, Vietnam's governing Communist Party began conducting a sweeping anti-corruption campaign. Since then, it has brought down a national president and senior government ministers, but the scale of the alleged graft involved in the latest scandal it uncovered raised questions about the true state of Vietnam's banking and property sectors.
On November 17, the Ministry of Public Security alleged that Truong My Lan, the chairperson of real estate developer Van Thinh Phat Holdings Group, had embezzled 304 trillion dong (€11.4 billion) from Saigon Commercial Bank, of which she was a majority stakeholder, over several years.
According to the ministry's statements, My Lan, who was first arrested last year, operated a vast network of more than 1,000 domestic and foreign subsidiaries as well as further shell companies that took out more than €40 billion in loans from the Saigon Commercial Bank, appropriating about a third of it through ""ghost companies"" she and her family and associates created.
In mid-November, the Ministry of Public Security also recommended the prosecution of a further 85 people, including 24 government officials and associates of Van Thinh Phat Holdings Group and Saigon Commercial Bank.
Days later, the Internal Affairs Commission of the Communist Party's Central Committee recommended opening investigations into another 23 state officials, including 12 from the State Bank of Vietnam, the country's central bank.
It is arguably the largest corruption scandal in recent Southeast Asian history. By comparison, the well-documented 1MDB scandal in Malaysia in the 2010s, which led to Malaysia's dominant party losing power for the first time ever, involved the theft of €4.1 billion from the country's sovereign wealth fund.   
The Communist Party of Vietnam embarked on its ""blazing furnace"" anti-graft campaign when Nguyen Phu Trong, the party's general secretary, defeated rival Nguyen Tan Dung — Dung was prime minister at the time and seen by many as allowing corruption to thrive.
The anti-corruption campaign has resulted in hundreds, if not thousands of party and government officials being dismissed in recent years.
In January, Nguyen Xuan Phuc resigned as state president and two deputy prime ministers were sacked over alleged corruption in the government procurement of coronavirus testing kits and the repatriation of Vietnamese nationals during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Speaking this month, after the revelations about the latest scandal, General Secretary Trong said Communist authorities, ""need to conduct the anti-corruption fight faster and in a more efficient manner."" He added, ""We won't stop here but will continue for the long term.""
Tuong Vu, a political science professor at the University of Oregon in the US, said General Secretary Trong could now have his sights set on some more big-name targets, including the former party boss of Ho Chi Minh City, Le Thanh Hai, who is known as ""the most corrupt official in Vietnam.""
Hai was the political boss of the southern business hub for decades, and although he was given a wrap on the knuckles in 2020, when the corruption-busters found his committee had engaged in improprieties, he has so far avoided any real punishment for his alleged wrongdoings.
""It is possible that Hai is next. He's also known to be close to former Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, who may still be a target,"" said Tuong Vu, referring to the political heavyweight whom Trong defeated in 2016. 
Indeed, it had been suggested by analysts that Hai and Dung may have been the two richest people in Vietnam at some point in the 2010s thanks to their alleged oversight of vast graft networks in southern Vietnam. 
""There is no doubt that more major scandals and arrests are forthcoming,"" said Michael Tatarski, a journalist living in Ho Chi Minh City who writes about Vietnamese politics in his Vietnam Weekly blog.
""A significant investigation into sand mining is underway,"" and it appears police are looking closely at the renewable energy sector and Vietnam Electricity, the country's largest power company, he added.
However, there are concerns that the scale of graft now being uncovered is denting economic stability.
When a number of private sector companies were hit with corruption allegations last year, it was suggested the anti-graft campaign was starting to affect business confidence. Reports leaked in the media claimed local government officials and civil servants were refusing to sign off on much-needed infrastructure investment deals for fear they would later be accused of corruption if the development projects didn't go according to plan.

Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at the Vietnam Studies Programme at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, pointed out that this is not the first significant investigation into a private company, but it is by far the largest.
He says that in 2022, Trinh Van Quyet, chairman of property and leisure company FLC Group and its subsidiary Bamboo Airlines, was arrested on charges of stock market manipulation; while months later, Do Anh Dung, chairman of the Tan Hoang Minh property development group, was detained on suspicion of fraudulent appropriation of assets.
Tran Qui Thanh, chairman of Tan Hiep Phat Group, the country's largest private-sector beverage producer, was arrested in April over alleged misappropriation of assets.
Given what has transpired so far, the latest corruption scandal ""might not further deteriorate business confidence in Vietnam, nor instill fear of being investigated,"" Giang said.
Indeed, other sources have made similar arguments, saying business confidence was more shaken by the first investigations into private sector corruption and that the business community in Vietnam has now become somewhat accustomed to the idea that the Communist Party might be staring over its shoulder.
Among the many allegations against Truong My Lan and her associates were accusations that they had bribed investigators for years to get them to overlook Saigon Commercial Bank's financial discrepancies. This includes bribes reportedly paid to the then-chief of the State Bank of Vietnam's Inspectorate and Supervision Department.
""This was a total regulatory failure,"" said Zachary Abuza, a professor of national security strategy at the US National War College in Washington, who added that it should raise questions about the business practices of other banks, too.
""If Lan could bribe regulators with $5.2 million to overlook non-performing loans and other criminal behavior at [the Saigon Commercial Bank], why not other banks?"" Abuza queried.

The latest corruption scandal also raises questions about political stability. Trong, the party chief, has torn up informal agreements on term limits and retirement ages that the Communist Party agreed to in the 1990s.
Trong, 79, is now in his third term in office and seemingly cannot step down as he's unable to find a trusted successor — the reason why he took on a third term in 2021, most pundits say. It remains unclear if he will try to run for a fourth term at the next National Congress in early 2026. 
""Anti-corruption has evolved from a means, to an end in itself. Combating corruption is seen as a way to uphold the party's legitimacy,"" said Giang. ""This is the new normal of Vietnamese politics.""

https://www.dw.com/en/nato-members-struggle-to-spend-their-military-budgets/a-67605419,POLITICS,NATO members struggle to spend their military budgets 01.12.2023,"The European military-industrial complex was on full display at a hotel in former East Berlin this week. An array of business suits and military uniforms buzzed about the conference area, as icons of the global arms industry boasted their lethal wares and top trans-Atlantic brass took to stages to promote common defense.
The message was clear: Peacetime is over. The so-called peace dividend, which Western societies have enjoyed since the end of the Cold War, has been spent. A new era of confrontation — from the European perspective, mainly with Russia — means getting ""fit for war to avoid war,"" as German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has said.
Achieving the level of deterrence that many active and retired war planners and policymakers have said is necessary does not come cheap.
""We have militaries that were neglected, in some of these countries, for three decades. And some of our NATO allies are truly not fully compatible in some cases with some of the equipment,"" Retired US Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove told DW. ""These things are important. And we're not there across our alliance yet.""
Breedlove's tenure as supreme allied commander, the NATO military alliance's top defense post he held until 2016, saw two significant turning points on the long road to Western rearmament. In 2014, Russia illegally took Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine into its orbit and, in the same year, NATO members agreed to spend at least 2% of GDP on their militaries within the decade.
That decade comes to an end next year, and military spending has gone up across the board, spurred by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Even as some countries, such as Germany, are unlikely to hit the magic mark, NATO estimates an 8.3% jump in 2023 over the previous year. That excludes US spending, which alone is more than twice the rest of the alliance combined. In all, more than $1.4 trillion (€1.3 trillion) is earmarked for NATO member defense budgets.
The figures dwarf the Russian side, which invaded Ukraine with less than $50 billion — about as much as Germany's Defense Ministry gets in a year. The war and its many missteps have forced the Kremlin to more than triple its official military budget through 2023, according to some independent analysts.
At the same time, Ukraine has been able to hold back one of world's most feared militaries, at least on paper, on a relative shoestring. Military aid for Ukraine is a fraction of its supporters' GDPs, and much of that goes into buying kit from Western suppliers.
""We should never ever think about war as a business,"" said Breedlove, who attended the conference at the invitation of Lockheed Martin, the weapons systems giant. ""But if you want to look at return on investment, those numbers are pretty good.""

Just how much and how urgently countries need to boost their forces largely comes down to perceptions of the war in Ukraine. Those who see a victory in halting Russia's initial effort to take over the entire country and severely degrading its forces, albeit at great human cost and with Ukraine divided, may be less enthused to double down on defense than those who see a dangerous precedent in allowing Russia to use a war of attrition as a play for time.
""Whether we can continue to deny any Russian progress after six months in a war of attrition, that is a very open question,"" said Retired Brigadier General Rainer Meyer zum Felde, who questioned whether new resources match future needs.
Regardless of the takeaway, the invasion has undermined European security assumptions. The mere size of defense budgets alone are unlikely to restore them. Spending and capability are related, but only indirectly.
""The problem is not that I don't have the money. The problem is I can't spend it,"" Kajsa Ollongren, the Dutch defense minister, told the conference. ""I'm standing in line with everyone else.""
The sentiment presents a central tension that was on display at the conference: a chicken-and-egg dilemma between governments that say they have the money to spend and companies that say they need the contracts to produce. Despite a number of transnational efforts, including within the European Union and at NATO level, to improve procurement and standardize needs, military officials expressed frustration at a lack of interoperability among forces. That includes basics, like bullets and radios.
Industry representatives are also unhappy, noting mixed signals from governments that make long-term planning difficult. For Germany, which is fast becoming the biggest defense player in Europe, it's unclear what happens after its five-year special fund of €100 billion runs out. It also faces a budget crisis going into 2024.
""There are definitely things that have gotten better,"" Hans Christoph Atzpodien, the managing director of the National Association of the German Security and Defense Industry, told DW. ""But we also need credible assurances that enough money is there over the next several years that we can really plan to ramp up capacity.""
Many contractors want longer time horizons, hoping to avoid hiring sprees to meet sudden demand, only to then issue layoffs if contracts dry up. Given the economic benefits, in terms of jobs and investment, that advocates of military spending tout, such a scenario would likely have political blowback.

Both private and public sector participants presented a united front against common, external threats, but the renewed weapons push comes at a time when global competition faces pressure from increased protectionism — including among allies. Multinational defense relies on national industries, which puts security and economic interests at odds.
The conference's corporate partners included 18 of the top 100 global arms producers, generating more than $263 billion (€242 billion) in arms sales in 2021, according to data compiled by conflict research institute, SIPRI. Four German firms make the list and three ""trans-European"" ones, but much of the revenue is American.
""[US companies] are of course as tough as nails when they come at the European market — and with their own conditions. They say, 'Our way or the highway.'"" said Atzpodien.
Outside the defense ecosystem, transparency watchdogs have expressed concern about potential conflicts of interest. With huge sums of tax money up for grabs, the closeness between public buyers and private sellers is a relationship they want to watch closely.
""Political consultations should be transparent, taking place within the framework of existing democratic institutions and not at private conferences financed by the arms industry. There is a real danger of this happening when high-ranking international representatives come together in this setting,"" Aurel Eschmann, a campaigner for LobbyControl, a German nonprofit, told DW in a statement.
Policymakers and industry leaders say they want to figure out who can do what best. The US is known for developing ""shiny objects,"" as former NATO commander Breedlove called big, expensive systems like missile interceptors or the advanced F-35 aircraft. Given their firepower and price tags, which often balloon over the course of production, these get most of the political and media attention when it comes to military spending.
Yet years of ""disproportional cuts"" now need ""disproportional growth"" to also rebuild less conspicuous capabilities that NATO has lost along the way, Lieutenant General Martin Schelleis told DW. As the chief of the German Joint Support and Enabling Service, which provides logistics and other support for all branches of the Bundeswehr, he is responsible for getting people and equipment to a fight and making sure they can.
""These small things — think of a €1.65 ($1.80) chainlink in a €10,000 racing bike — if those aren't there, then the racing bike is of no use to me. But no one's looking at the thing that costs €1.65,"" he said. ""We have to change that. There needs to be political interest also in these small things, so that they get procured.""
Even the high-tech F-35 needs a supply chain of run-of-the-mill parts to stay in the air, Schelleis added.

What no amount of military spending can cover, however, is all the infrastructure that falls outside the Defense Ministry's domain. As the war in Ukraine has demonstrated, rail, roads, ports and energy supplies are all critical.
Germany is a major transit point given its geographic location, and austere budgets have shortchanged many of these areas as well. How much financial firepower will be left to fund them after spending more on trying to rebuild hard-power tools is a matter of heated debate.
""The big area known as 'enablement' is not just a military task, but an entire national effort,"" said Schelleis.

https://www.dw.com/en/will-offshore-launches-solve-the-spaceport-bottleneck/a-67573892,SCIENCE,Will offshore launches solve the spaceport bottleneck? 01.12.2023,"""I don't want to go back to a world where we don't have satellite communication because it would be a poorer, hungrier and dirtier, polluted world,"" said Tom Marotta at The Spaceport Company.
But we have a problem, Marotta said, and it's called the ""spaceport bottleneck"". Land-based spaceports in the US are congested, so we can't launch satellites — especially small satellites that service today's growing demand for mobile communication — as quickly as people seem to want or need them. 
If spaceports are so congested, you may wonder, shouldn't we address our growing demand first and launch fewer of them? When roads get congested and the air polluted, don't we encourage people to drive less and ride a bike instead, or walk. Yes, but not in space. We keep firing satellites up. And it's not just the launchpads that are congested, but space itself.
Low-Earth orbit (LEO), at a range of about 160-2,000 kilometers (99-1,242 miles) above ground, is where most of our satellites go. That includes Earth Observation satellites that monitor the state of our environment. It's also home to the International Space Station (ISS).
It's estimated there will be between 58,000 or close to 100,000 new satellites in space by 2030. That's up from current numbers of 5,500 - 6,700 in LEO.
""Now is the time to build more launchpads because the demand for data from space is greater than it has ever been before,"" said Marotta. ""But in the US, only four spaceports are regularly sending satellites to orbit. And as you know, Europe has none.""
Europe does, in fact, have one spaceport at Kourou in French Guiana, but none on the European continent. The UK is fairly advanced with its plans for onshore spaceports at Sutherland, Snowdonia and Cornwall, the latter of which is licensed and operational. And there are others, such as at Andoya in Norway.

The basic idea behind a mobile offshore spaceport is all in the name. It's a launchpad located relatively close to a coastline but at sea, where it is no danger to humans, other animals or the land-environment. And it's mobile, operated either from an open-ended barge, similar to cargo vessels, or a liftboat (also known as a jack-up platform) that looks like an oil rig.
Because they are mobile, offshore spaceports can (theoretically) move if weather conditions turn sour, and allow a launch to go ahead. Land-based launchpads can't do that — they tend to sit on top of deep craters and are dependent on good weather conditions.
Offshore spaceport experts like Marotta or Alain Pajonk, project manager for the German Offshore Spaceport Alliance (GOSA), have said sea launches don't need exhaust trenches, and that makes them more mobile.
Offshore spaceports do make one wonder whether rockets launched at sea will boil the ocean or marine life — rocket engines generate thousands of kelvin in heat (1,000 kelvin = 726.85 degrees Celsius, or around 1,340 Fahrenheit).
Pajonk said the consideration is irrelevant. ""We're talking about a few seconds, after which your launch vehicle is already 700 meters away. There is almost no interaction with the ocean water. There will be some exhaust and chemicals from the combustion, but the quantity is not environmentally relevant,"" he said.
An offshore spaceport should also cater to more than one type rocket, said Pajonk. Land-based launchpads tend to be built for one specific, often heavy launch vehicle, like a SpaceX's Falcon 9, Blue Origin's New Glenn or Europe's Ariane 5 and 6.
""You need new pads for the new launch vehicles and we're not seeing pads that are built for multiple [types of] launch vehicles,"" said Pajonk, whose German Offshore Spaceport Alliance is planning a spaceport in the North Sea.
Both Pajonk and Marotta said most commercial demand these days is for small satellite launches on smaller rockets, such as Europe's Vega, Rocket Lab's Electron or Firefly's Alpha. But servicing different types of rockets all in one place may be harder than it sounds.
""The idea that any launchpad, at sea or on land, can accommodate multiple different launch vehicles is theoretically fine, but in reality doesn't work out,"" said Malcolm Macdonald, a professor in satellite engineering at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow.
""That was the plan for both Shetland and Sutherland [spaceports in the UK], yet both have ended up developing pads for each different vehicle as they each have slightly different requirements, so I'd expect a future sea launched system to end up in a similar position,"" he said.
Ultimately, the industry would like to see common standards as in the commercial airline and airport industry, but that appears to be a way off for the space industry.
The Spaceport Company aims to start with jack-up platforms located about 5-20 kilometers from the coast — ""close enough so that if a technician has to run out to the platform to repair the rocket, or refuel the generators on the platform,"" said Marotta.
But ""operating at sea is a punishing environment,"" Marotta said. Salt corrosion and severe weather are just two of the considerations, but there's plenty to learn from the gas and oil, and offshore wind industries.
Jack-up platforms get their name from the fact that they have legs that extend down toward the seabed, enabling the platform to rise above the water. They are ""perfectly stable,"" said Marotta. ""The downside is that [they] only operate in relatively shallow waters — about 50-60 meters.""
That means you couldn't use a liftboat off the Azores in the Atlantic, for instance, which the GOSA team considered before opting for a floating barge.
""Of course, you're more stable with the legs than when you're floating, but not fully stable, you do still have some drift, "" said Pajonk.
In the North Sea, GOSA's floating barge would sit about 180 nautical miles (333.36 kilometers, 207.14 miles) offshore — it couldn't be much closer due to other ocean traffic. ""But if we wanted to launch from the Azores, we could be a few miles away from the shore,"" said Pajonk.    
So, a floating barge offers the potential of launching from a few more locations. But a jack-up platform, on the other hand, offers an option for reusable rockets as well. ""We're designing our system to be modular,"" said Marotta, ""we can serve more types of [rockets], we can turn it into a landing platform, so it's a lot more flexible than a ship-based platform.""
Both The Seaport Company and GOSA said offshore spaceports will increase the ""cadence"" of launches — there'll be more satellites launches, more frequently.
While The Seaport Company's Marotta said 12-18 launches per platform were feasible for them, GOSA's Alain Pajonk said they were aiming for 12-24 launched per month per launchpad.
""That is a lot!,"" said Macdonald. ""And so, the scale does appear to be there […], and if they can do final integration on the transfer ship rather than in a hanger at the launch site, then maybe it will be fine.""
In both cases, there won't be any people at the launchpad at the time of launch. All missions will be run from control centers onshore.
Before The Spaceport Company and GOSA, there was the Sea Launch company, an international joint venture that included American, Russian, Norwegian and Ukrainian partners.
They operated in international waters on the equator, using a large command ship for personnel to run the launch operations and a mobile oil platform as a launchpad. The company was reportedly limited to commercial customers, with no government contracts to sustain its business, and was famed for a spectacular explosion during a launch in 2007 that forced the venture into bankruptcy.
Since then, one or two Chinese ocean-based launch initiatives have taken up the mantle. The private space company, Galactic Energy, successfully launched a Ceres-1 rocket from a floating platform near Hainan Island in September, putting four satellites into orbit.
There are also plans for ocean spaceports off the coasts of Ireland and Denmark.

https://www.dw.com/en/how-will-signas-insolvency-affect-germany/a-67600415,BUSINESS,How will Signa's insolvency affect Germany? 30.11.2023,"Employees at Germany's Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof department stores, which adorn many of the country's city centers, have long been fearful for their jobs. Corinna Gross, head of the national retail group at Germany's major trade union Verdi, told DW that some felt ""absolute insecurity.""
Over the years, employees have already weathered two insolvencies. Of the 170 branches owned by the company in 2020, only 91 remain. Just this spring, Galeria presented an insolvency plan to shore up its remaining subsidiaries.
Now that Signa Holding GmbH, owned by Austrian real estate mogul and retail entrepreneur Rene Benko, has declared insolvency, the plan could be at risk as any remaining financing evaporates. The insolvency plan obliged parent company Signa to contribute €200 million ($218 million) to Galeria's rehabilitation, but a large portion of that money has yet to change hands.
Germany's last major department store group is one of 1,000 firms in the Signa network. Swiss Signa Retail Selection AG has now also filed for protection against creditors.

""If the investments to modernize these department stores don't arrive, we've got a big problem,"" Hendrik Schröder, professor in marketing and trade at the University of Duisburg-Essen, told DW. ""And that problem will pass on to whoever might be interested in taking over the stores.""
Meanwhile, Verdi unionists hope this will provide an opportunity for Galeria — formally on the market since Wednesday, when Signal Retail Selection AG took the necessary steps to allow parts of the business to be sold — to find a new owner.
Union representatives hope a retailer interested in buying up the department stores will emerge. They consider a retailer far preferable to Signa, a property investor.
""Rental costs extract profits from a business,"" Gross explained. ""So if the owner is a property investor, in my opinion, that is the worst possible basis for a retail business.""
Both Galeria and Verdi expect business to carry on a usual in the immediate future, especially when looking ahead to the busy Christmas season.
The Galeria corporation has stated that so far the situation has not had any immediate negative consequences. The group said it plans to ""calmly await"" the outcome of Signa's insolvency proceedings.
Several banks might not have that same luxury. Signa primarily grew by incurring debt in the form of bank loans. The Swiss private bank Julius Baer, for example, wrote off 70 million Swiss francs (€73 million, $80 million) in November. Total nominal exposure to the group tops 600 million Swiss francs.
Several state-backed German regional banks might also be in a vulnerable position. In financial circles, the Hessian bank Helaba is said to have lent the group several hundreds of millions of euros. While Helaba has not refuted these claims outright, it has stated that it will not comment on individual customer relations.
Observers have said banks BayernLB and NordLB have lent similar amounts. There's even talk of Baden-Württemberg's LBBW being involved. But these claims have yet to be confirmed.
""Any other bank that has lent the Benko group money would do well to set aside capital as a precaution,"" Dieter Hein, a bank analyst at the independent research firm fairesearch, told DW. ""It was to be expected that real estate groups would find themselves in a bind. Signa isn't the only group that's in trouble, or will soon be in trouble.""
It's possible  the market for commercial properties will soon face more upheaval. The real estate sector has come under pressure generally of late as interest rates continue to rise, subsequently pushing up financing costs.
This is ultimately what brought Signa Holding to its knees. Its business model was based on the near-zero interest rates of past years and the real estate boom this triggered.
""Signa's bust is just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Sven Carstensen, head of bulwiengesa, a consulting and analysis firm for the real estate industry in Germany.
""Of course it will affect the trade market. Everyone will become more cautious when it comes to financing. And I think it will also leave some scars in our city centers,"" he added.
All Carstensen could hope for was that solutions could be found to swiftly bring individual projects to conclusion, such as the Elbtower in Hamburg. He agreed that other businesses or undertakings in the property market could be facing further trouble.
The German Retail Association, on the other hand, is optimistic. While it has admitted to being concerned about recent developments regarding Signa's insolvency proceeding and its potential impact on Galeria, it also believes department stores are still key focal points in city centers. This also benefits neighboring stores, as well as business from other sectors, the group said, adding that it believes department stores will continue to hold a valuable place in the retail landscape.

In the village of Makolo, in the far north of Cameroon, pupils are streaming into the classrooms. Lawyer and women's rights activist Marthe Wandou has come to talk to them. 
""My dream is for every girl and boy to have the opportunity to go to school to the level they want,"" she says.
Wandou is an affilitate of 1st National Women's Convention for Peace in Cameroon, the 2023 recipient of the German Africa Prize. The grouping of 77 organizations campaigns for change and an end to the crisis in Cameroon. 
Wandou and her counterparts in 1st National Women's Convention for Peace in Cameroon are calling for an immediate ceasefire in Cameroon, where separatist groups fighting for independence of the English-speaking territories since 2017.
The conflict has claimed more than 6,000 lives and displaced over 712,000 people.
Wandou is particularly concerned about the schoolgirls in Cameroon.
In Makolo, not all parents allow their daughters to go to school.
Child marriage is a major problem. According to UNICEF, more than 30% of girls in Cameroon are married before they turn 18.
Wandou tries to persuade girls and young women to go back to school or learn a trade. But first, she has to win over their parents.
""For cultural reasons, people say that a girl who goes to school can't be a good wife,"" says Wandou. ""She won't find anyone to marry her, she'll just get pregnant. I feel bad because these prejudices still exist 40 years later. It's terrible and that's why we are sensitizing the families.""
Girls and women in Cameroon are often attacked, kidnapped, enslaved or displaced by Boko Haram terrorists.
In 2016, Aisha and her entire family were abducted by Boko Haram and she was forced to marry one of its fighters.
""Women are beaten for no reason and constantly raped,"" Aisha, who is now 21, told DW.
""Some marry to have at least a minimum of protection, otherwise there is nothing resembling a marriage in the true sense of the word. All Boko Haram fighters have the right to have sex with any woman in the camp. Women are raped to the point where they can no longer walk. If their husband dies and they are not ready to marry another man within 24 hours, they are beheaded immediately.""
Aisha managed to escape from the Boko Haram camp with her baby. Marthe Wandou arranged psychosocial and financial support for the young mother who now runs her own business.
""It is important that we leave difficult experiences behind us and gain hope and courage to take control of our lives again,"" the activist says.
In the fishing village of Debundscha, in the southwest of Cameroon, Esther Omam has set up a day clinic.
Her NGO, Reach Out Cameroon, offers advice and free medication to thousands of patients weekly. It is part of 1st National Women's Convention for Peace in Cameroon.
Health centers in Debundscha were destroyed in fighting between separatists and the army.
""The supply of medicines for people living with HIV and AIDS has completely collapsed,"" says Omam. ""People cannot easily visit a health center without fear of being targeted.""
Reach Out Cameroon was one of the first organizations to offer help to victims of flooding in March 2023. Omam's involvement in humanitarian aid spans more than 20 years. 
""The women talk to me about the need for access to water, and safe education. I have suffered from the same things. That's why it's satisfying for me to know that we are touching and changing lives.""
Omam is active in helping women to set up small businesses and says she wants to break cycles of poverty and oppression.
In the town of Bamenda, in northwestern Cameroon, the services of Sally Mboumien and her all-woman team are in high demand. 
Common Action for Gender Development offers reproductive health counseling and helps survivors of sexual violence. It is part of 1st National Women's Convention for Peace in Cameroon.
Mboumien regularly holds talks for girls in the region where she herself grew up and understands the challenges.
""They don't even have a health service to help them,” she says.
""The women feel that they are being cheated economically, that they are being cheated of their well-being, that they have no bodily autonomy and that they have no leadership role. They are victims of many forms of abuse and violence.""

Since 2015, Mboumien has been working to train young women to become active in their communities.
''Nowadays you hardly ever find girls in leadership positions, says Dorin Nkwai, a Bamenda-based youth activist.
""Even if someone applies, they simply say: 'No, we can't hire a girl'. And why? Because she has to go on maternity leave soon because she's getting married. It should be made sure that there is a balanced representation: fifty-fifty men and women.""
Mboumien is inspired by the young women like Nkwai who look up to her and believes that having women in leadership roles could help to bring peace to Cameroon.

https://www.dw.com/en/new-climate-fund-offers-hope-to-developing-countries/a-67595163,CLIMATE,New climate fund offers hope to developing countries 30.11.2023,"After years of seeing her home country of Uganda hit by the impacts of climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels, Ireen Twongirwe is angry. 
""You can't predict what is coming, you know? Like you find when it's the season for rain now sunshine comes in, when it's the season for sunshine, now rain comes in. So, you know, it's hard to predict,"" said Twongirwe, executive director of the nonprofit Women for Green Economy Movement Uganda.
The unpredictability she described is destroying crops and livelihoods, which she said leads to ""all sorts of conflicts in communities and the country at large"" due to price increases.
East Africa has been suffering severe drought since 2020. The worst in 40 years, it has left more than 4 million people in need of humanitarian aid. World Weather Attribution scientists, who investigate the link between extreme weather events and climate change, have said the drought was made 100 times more likely by hotter temperatures linked to the burning of fossil fuels.
And it is by no means a unique story. In some regions, heat waves, droughts, hurricanes and other weather extremes are becoming stronger and more frequent as we warm the planet with greenhouse gas emissions. Communities in poorer countries that have done the least to contribute to climate change often face the brunt of the impacts of a heating planet. 
""The reality is that we hear about them when disaster hits them — for a couple of days or weeks,"" Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International, told DW. ""But after that, we all forget about them. We don't provide them enough support to recover from these impacts to rebuild their homes and livelihoods.""
After more than a decade of pleas from developing nations for financing to address climate change-caused loss and damage, negotiators at last year's UN COP27 climate summit in Egypt agreed to establish a designated fund. One year later, it has been formally launched.
""I congratulate parties for this historic decision. This sends a positive signal of momentum to the world and to our work,"" Sultan al-Jaber, the United Arab Emirate's COP28 president, said at the talks in Dubai.
The aim of the new fund, which has been described as a ""historic agreement,"" is to help poorer countries meet the cost of losses and damages linked to increasingly extreme weather. It could also provide money to deal with what are known as ""slow onset"" impacts, such as rising sea levels, which could see island nations such as the Maldives but also Tuvalu or Barbuda submerged by the end of the century.
After COP27, country delegates have come together as part of a series of transitional committee meetings for a loss and damage fund to hash out the details and financing. After four sessions broke down in disagreement, negotiators finally came to an accord in early November — although observers said some parties were far from happy with the result.
One of the main sticking points was around the institution designated to host the fund. Richer nations like the United States favored the World Bank, but Alpha Kaloga, the Africa head negotiator on loss and damage involved in establishing it in the first place, said developing nations had strong reservations. 
""The World Bank is an institution that is excluding many developing countries in terms of eligibility criteria,"" he said, adding that following extreme events, the bank would give loans to African countries with already high levels of debt. ""We think if we have to take loans, it has to be highly concessional.""
Assessing the vulnerability of countries eligible to access loss and damage funding following an extreme weather event, and which countries would have to contribute to financing, has also been a bone of contention.
Developed nations want contributions from the oil-rich Gulf states and China, which despite being the world's second-largest economy after the US is categorized as a developing country.
Though China emits more carbon dioxide than any other country, the United States remains the biggest historical emitter. Since 1750, it has spewed almost twice as much CO2 into the atmosphere as China.
""When it comes to legal and moral obligation, that lies with rich countries because of their historical responsibility,"" said Singh of Climate Action Network International. ""But large countries like China or the Gulf nations, that are oil states if they want to donate, can always put money in.""
The transitional committee's recommendation presented to COP28 delegates for consideration does not call for a commitment from industrialized countries to pay into the fund, but instead urges them to contribute and encourages developing nations to do the same.
Despite the agreement on a fund, no clear target for the volume of financing has been determined. The United Arab Emirates announced on Thursday it would put $100 million (€92 million) into the fund, and Germany has pledged the same amount. 
Developing nations hope it will reach billions. Flooding caused by heavy rainfall in 2022 in Pakistan led to economic loss and damage valued at $30 billion alone. According to the London School of Economics, loss and damage in developing countries could reach a total of between $290 and $580 billion annually by 2030.
Although public money from richer countries should form the bulk of the new fund, Singh said other ""innovative"" streams of revenue such as levies on fossil fuel extraction and financial transaction taxes or a tax on business air passengers should also be explored. 

Industrialized nations don't have a strong track record. In 2009, they agreed to mobilize $100 billion a year by 2020 to help address the needs of developing countries in a warming world. They didn't reach the target until 2023, which Preety Bhandari, a senior adviser in the Global Climate Program with the World Resources Institute, said has led to a lack of trust.
""If there are going to be shifting goal posts on commitments, as has been the case with the $100 billion financing, then is this entire multilateral venture under threat?"" she asked. But Bhandari also stressed the importance of establishing a loss and damage fund. 
""We have to try. We can't give up just because there has not been adequate progress. If the issue is not put on the table, if we give up right up front, then the whole battle is lost.""

https://www.dw.com/en/gaza-conflict-middle-east-tourism-struggles-for-survival/a-67585470,CONFLICTS,Gaza conflict: Middle East tourism struggles for survival 30.11.2023,"Moustafa Hassan is slowly starting to worry.
""Sharm [el-Sheikh] is safe, it is a city of peace,"" insisted the Egyptian man who works as a food and beverage manager at a hotel in the popular resort town. But potential visitors seem to be thinking twice about coming, the 50-year-old father of four told DW. 
""The number of tourists to Egypt has decreased due to the Gaza war,"" Hassan noted. Sharm el-Sheikh is about a three-hour drive from the Israeli border and, of all of Egypt's traditional tourist sites, closest to Israel's border with Egypt. 
In early October the militant, Islamist Hamas group, classified as a terrorist organization by the US, the EU, Germany and others, launched attacks on Israel that resulted in the deaths of around 1,200 Israelis and foreigners. Since then Israel has been bombing the Gaza Strip, where Hamas is based, and at latest count, around 14,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. A temporary truce that was due to expire on Thursday has been extended by a day, but the conflict is expected to be ongoing.
Some resorts in Sharm el-Sheikh depend on visitors from Israel, Hassan continued, and these guests are not coming because of what is happening back home. Other hotels, catering mostly to European holidaymakers, are suffering because those tourists are worried about their safety in the Middle East.
But as Egypt slips further into an economic crisis and the Egyptian pound continues to devalue, a slump in the sector is the last thing locals need. Tourism makes up between 10% to 15% of Egypt's gross domestic product every year.
""Tourism is a source of income for workers in the tourism sector but also for those connected to it from afar, such as in taxis, supermarkets, diving centers and amusement parks,"" Hassan explained.
Right now, it seems the slowdown is only just starting, possibly because those travelers who couldn't get a refund still went ahead as planned. The problem will become more apparent as future reservations are tallied, travel agents and tour operators said, adding that these have already fallen over the past two months.
It is still too early to tell what the impact will be, Dubai- and Beirut-based financial consultancy Nasser Saidi & Associates confirmed in a market briefing at the end of October. But the early signs are worrying, the briefing added, noting that since early October ticket purchases for Egypt had fallen 26%, for Jordan by 49% and for Lebanon by 74% compared to the same period last year.
This is despite the fact that there are few official travel warnings issued by governments for anywhere outside of the main sites of the conflict ­— that is, Israel, Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
The US government has also advised its citizens not to go to Lebanon because of the presence of the Hezbollah group there; before the current cease-fire, Hezbollah's armed wing and the Israeli army were exchanging fire over the southern Lebanese border.
As a result, even after a particularly successful summer, Lebanese visitor numbers have plummeted. Local media report hotel occupancy rates of between zero and 7%, compared to hotels usually being at least a quarter full.
Hezbollah is an Iran-backed Shiite political party and militant group in Lebanon. Hezbollah is considered a terrorist organization by the US, Germany and several Sunni Arab countries, while the EU lists its armed wing as a terrorist group.
Lebanon's crisis-riven economy remains heavily dependent on tourism with the sector providing as much as 40% of its national income, which has decreased during the current financial crisis.
Travelers have also been advised to avoid going to any areas of Egypt or Jordan directly bordering Israel. But most popular tourist destinations tend to be a good distance away from those locations.
Next door to Israel, Jordan has also seen around half its hotel reservations canceled in October, Hussein Helalat, spokesperson for the Jordan Hotel Association, told local media earlier this month.
After finally recovering from the aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Jordan's hoteliers had been expecting an almost 95% occupancy rate during the final quarter of this year. Now, they might possibly hit 80%, Helalat said. Sites like Petra, with its world-famous archeology, were particularly affected because it was mostly Americans and Europeans who came to see these.
In Jordan, tourism regularly brings in between 11% and 15% of the country's national income.
Jordanian tourism entrepreneur and marketing consultant Najwan al-Masri has also been watching the numbers carefully. The figures for November, as compiled by the local tourism board, are not yet out, she told DW, but there was a slight decline, from September to October. It's gone from 760,000 visitors in September to 730,000 in October, al-Masri noted.
""As a stakeholder in the tourism industry, I've observed a significant downturn in activity from the beginning of this month,"" al-Masri continued, ""including a sluggish movement from international visitors and also within the local market.""
Other destinations have also been hard hit, like Israel, for obvious reasons. Bethlehem, which Christians believe to be the birthplace of Jesus Christ, usually sees its busiest time during the Christmas holiday. However, in the middle of November, Palestinian Christians in the city decided there should be no public celebrations while the conflict goes on in Gaza.
Some other nearby destinations have also felt the impact but it's been less pronounced. Morocco and Tunisia both experienced a drop of bookings between 15% and 20%, tour operators told France's Le Monde newspaper earlier this month. And in nearby Cyprus, Israeli tourists previously made up around 15% of all visitors and were the second biggest group to holiday there after Britain; they're not coming now because of fighting at home.
As to how long the slump in this all-important sector will go on in the region, or what the end effect will be, that remains as uncertain as a lasting resolution to the conflict in Gaza.
For now, things still seem to be alright, Hassan, the hospitality manager in Sharm el-Sheikh, said. ""But when hotel owners find their source of income is decreasing due to the lack of tourists, they will think about reducing expenses. And they see that salaries are the primary expenses,"" he suggested.
""In the event of a prolonged war, the entire tourism industry — and especially small businesses that have been thriving in recent years with significant investments from young Jordanians — stands to suffer,"" Jordanian tourism consultant al-Masri concluded.
The Christmas period is always an important time for tourism and if the conflict continues, ""the jeopardy extends to our next season,"" she said.

https://www.dw.com/en/what-to-expect-from-the-un-climate-summit/a-67452592,NATURE AND ENVIRONMENT,What to expect from the UN climate summit 29.11.2023,"The annual UN summit aimed at averting climate disaster kicks off this week, with the oil-rich United Arab Emirates hosting the talks. 
The choice of the host nation for the 28th climate negotiations proved controversial, as did the decision to appoint Sultan al-Jaber, UAE's minister of industry and advanced technology and CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, to preside over them.  
While world leaders welcomed the appointment of the fossil fuel executive — US climate envoy John Kerry called him a ""terrific choice"" — many politicians and environmental groups were outraged. More than 130 EU and US lawmakers signed a public letter saying his presidency ""risks undermining negotiations."" 
Discussions at COP28 will span everything from tackling agricultural emissions and food security to how countries can adapt to weather extremes as we heat the planet by burning fossil fuels.
But three key issues  are set to dominate talks: climate financing for vulnerable countries, bolstering emissions cuts pledges and phasing out fossil fuels.
A ""loss and damage"" fund for low-income countries hit by extreme weather had long been resisted by wealthy, high-polluting nations who feared being on the hook for vast sums of money. One 2018 study estimated losses from climate change could cost vulnerable nations between $290 billion and $580 billion by 2030. 
Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at the Bonn-headquartered Climate Action Network, told DW that developing countries most vulnerable to the consequences of planetary heating have done little to contribute to the fossil fuel emissions causing climate change.   
 ""Who bears the most responsibility?"" said Singh, ""It's rich countries who have put close to 80% of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, which is responsible for the climate crisis."" 
But last year at COP27, delegates reached a major breakthrough, agreeing to establish a fund to help developing countries recover after weather disasters. Delegates in Dubai will have to agree on the finer sticking points like which states will be able to access the fund, who will pay how much into it and how will it be administered.
Ahead of the talks, a transitional committee of representatives from developing and developed nations drafted recommendations to answer those questions. The highly charged discussions failed several times before producing a tentative agreement proposing the World Bank host the fund in the interim.
This has been seen as a major concession by developing nations, who fear the institution would give richer nations more influence.  
The committee also recommended against the contentious idea of making payments legally binding, instead urging developed countries to contribute to the fund.  
""We are extremely concerned as civil society because we don't find those recommendations very strong, particularly holding the developed countries to account to pay for the loss and damage,"" said Singh.  
In 2015, nearly 200 governments signed the historic Paris Agreement, a legally binding treaty with the goal of keeping global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to pre-industrial levels. So far, average temperatures have increased 1.2 C, with 2023 on track to be the hottest ever recorded.  
This year, the COP will see the first-ever ""global stocktake"", or review, of each country's progress in slashing emissions to meet the heating pledge.  
""It's about looking at what has been achieved, where the gaps are and what more needs to be done,"" said Singh. ""It's a process to respond to scientific findings."" 
The stocktake, which started in 2021, involved collecting and analyzing data on governments' climate action plans, emissions cuts and adaptation efforts. That was bundled into a UN report published in September with a stark warning for the planet — and COP delegates — that countries are way off track and the time frame left to secure a ""livable planet is rapidly closing.""  
At COP28, states and businesses will have to up their game to rapidly decarbonize, the report said. Increasing ambition on emissions cuts will be high on the agenda.  

Though governments have long known they are fueling climate change by burning coal, oil and gas, many have no intention of stopping. In fact, a new UN report found petrostates are planning huge expansions that would blow the world's carbon budget and throw ""humanity's future into question.""  
COP delegates have never officially committed to stop using fossil fuels. They were only mentioned for the first time in official decisions at COP26 in Glasgow when governments agreed to ""phase down"" coal, shying away from a full phaseout.  
The amount of coal being burned continued to rise even after the pledge. Last year, delegates failed to call for all fossil fuels to be phased out despite a coalition of around 80 countries pushing for it.  
Still, some campaigners are optimistic that new recommendations in the September global stocktake report will put the issue on the COP28 agenda. The UN report called for the scaling up of ""renewable energy while phasing out all unabated fossil fuels.""

Romain Ioualalen of the advocacy organization Oil Change International said it showed how much the dial had moved on the topic.  
""Even a few years ago, it was unthinkable to have a decision on fossil fuel phaseout at COP because of the influence of oil and gas producing countries,"" he told DW. 
There is likely to be severe pushback at the summit, however, given that oil and gas producers, like COP 28 host UAE, are so resistant. Mariam Almheiri, the country's climate minister, told the news agency Reuters that such a move would hurt producing countries reliant on fossil fuels for revenue.
But failing to agree on a phaseout will harm the summit's credibility, said Ioualalen.  
""People will start asking questions about why are we still meeting if we can't get an agreement on what's actually driving the problem we're trying to solve,"" he said. ""It will also signal to the oil and gas industry that governments are not serious about the transition."" 
Despite the problems, Ioualalen and other activists believe the summit is worthwhile.  
""You won't find any other process in the diplomatic space where a country with 50 or 100,000 people can stand up to the United States and China and call them out for their lack of ambition on climate change,"" said Ioualalen. ""It's flawed, but it's still deeply precious.""

https://www.dw.com/en/google-accused-of-placing-ads-on-sanctioned-web-pages/a-67584045,BUSINESS,Google accused of placing ads on sanctioned web pages 29.11.2023,"Google search ads of Fortune 500 companies and US government institutions have landed on websites with compromising content, including hardcore pornography and piracy sites, via a lesser-known part of Google's search ads business. 
A 269-page study by the ad analytics firm Adalytics has exposed instances of alcoholic beverages advertised on children's websites, NSA recruitment postings on an Iranian government website, and donation solicitations for the US Republican Party on a Russian porn site. Well-known brands like BMW, Apple, Lego, Microsoft and government agencies were also affected.
The study sheds light on the lack of transparency in Google's search network, raising questions about how companies can protect their brand and prevent potential violations of US sanctions.
Advertisers have expressed concern that their ads were found on such sites and emphasized their stringent standards for ad placement. For example, the study found ads for BMW's new electric car models on the far-right news portal Breitbart News. 
""We have initiated a thorough investigation to precisely determine how our advertising appeared in the context highlighted by you, and based on our findings, we will take any necessary additional measures,"" BMW said in response to a DW inquiry.
The report, titled ""Does a lack of transparency create brand safety concerns for search advertisers?,"" calls out the lack of transparency in Google's search ads business, particularly within the less visible Google Search Partners network.
The Google Search Partners network, or GSP network, consists of third-party sites displaying Google search ads. Adalytics said it used open-source methods and public information to identify thousands of websites within the GSP network. The study reveals that the network placed ads on sites that advertisers would not have chosen knowingly, including porn sites, platforms with pirated content and politically extreme websites. Adalytics also found instances of GSPs hosting copyright-infringing content and engaging in deceptive tactics, in violation of Google's own publisher policies.
The list of affected advertisers revealed concerning instances where major corporations, state authorities and NGOs may have violated US sanctions, possibly unintentionally. Adalytics cited examples such as the FBI, NSA and the French bank PNB Paribas appearing on websites of entities in countries like Russia and Iran, like the Tehran-based Iranian Alloy Steel Company, that may be under direct US sanctions.
Despite Google's publisher terms explicitly prohibiting ad placements in sanctioned countries, the findings suggest a lack of enforcement or oversight. This raises questions for advertisers about how companies might unknowingly contribute to potential sanctions violations through their digital advertising campaigns on Google's platform.
Advertisers running search ads on Google are opted into the GSP network by default, according to the report. Notably, Google does not provide a comprehensive list of third-party sites in its Search Partners network.
""Google Ads doesn't provide information detailing the website where your ad was shown on the search network,"" Google's own documentation states, according to the report. By creating a campaign for the search network, advertisers are acknowledging that Google's policies meet their company's image and reputation standards.
Responding to a DW inquiry, Google denied the allegations. ""Adalytics has a track record of publishing inaccurate reports that misrepresent our products and make completely exaggerated claims,"" Dan Taylor, vice president of Google's global advertising business, said.
Nevertheless, the company will thoroughly examine the report. Based on the limited information available, Google asserts that no advertising revenue has been shared with sanctioned entities.

Google also communicated that Adalytics' data collection methods are inaccurate. Additionally, the company points out that it is in the interest of the for-profit analytics firms to sow distrust and then offer their own services.
Adalytics released a similar study in the summer, criticizing the opaque advertising practices in YouTube's video advertising.
""The opaqueness of the current advertising market allows for such practices,"" Dutch EU Parliament member Paul Tang, who specializes in technology companies and had access to the Adalytics study, told DW.
He advocates for stricter legislation as Google continues to disavow any responsibility, which he deems ""a shame."" The EU recently championed stricter consumer rules for online giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google through the Digital Markets Act.

https://www.dw.com/en/do-computers-make-children-dumber-not-smarter/a-67573787,SCIENCE,"Do computers make children 'dumber, not smarter'? 29.11.2023","Computers and tablets are an increasingly important part of education in school classrooms. 46.7% of the world's primary school classrooms have access to computers, according to UN data, with figures as high as 98% in the EU.
Not everyone thinks computers are a benefit in the classroom, though. Ralf Lankau, a professor of media theory at Hochschule Offenbach has said ""tablets and laptops do not make children smarter, but dumber"" — referring specifically to kids up the age of 10 years.
Lankau is one of 40 academics who have launched a petition through Germany's ""Gesellschaft für Bildung und Wissen"" (Society for Education and Knowledge) to express their concerns about the effects of digital technologies on childhood development.
They are calling for a moratorium on digitization in German schools and kindergartens for children aged 4-11 years.
""The aim is not to ban digital technology, but to return to the task of teaching,""  Lankau told DW. ""We should be asking: What is the learning objective and how can analog and digital media help us achieve it? And not: What new technology is available and how do we use it at school?"".
The petition comes at a time when German schools are being criticized for falling behind in digitalization.
But Lankau and the other academics want the German Ministry of Education to rethink how technology is used in German kindergartens and classrooms.
Lankau said the current education system doesn't focus on learning and educational benefits of social skills.
""Educational institutions [should] focus on the individual [and how they can] develop according to their own interests and inclinations and become part of the social community,"" said Lankau.
The main problem, he said, was that IT (information technology) and business associations have determined what happens in schools for 40 years, when we should be asking, ""What do you need locally in your school, in terms of staff and possibly also media technology?""

Maria Hatzigianni, an expert in early childhood education and digital technologies at the University of West Attica, Greece, said Lankau's comments were part of an old ""anti-technology"" trend.
""People have been making these comments about computers since the 1990s. Every time a new technology comes out, people panic. Even Socrates, almost 2,500 years ago, said that writing things down will make us forgetful,"" Hatzigianni told DW.
But how bad is computer use for children really? Is this just another case of adults telling kids to get off their screens, or are the concerns real?
According to Prakash Ranganathan, Director for Center for Cyber Security Research at University of North Dakota in the US, the scientific evidence around the effects of digital technologies on child development is mixed.
""There is some evidence of effects on cognitive development — an inability to focus after computer over-use can lead to [a] passive learning experience which may hinder critical thinking and problem-solving skills. But it's unclear if these potential negative impacts are short or long-lasting,"" Ranganathan told DW.
Some studies suggest that over-use of computers affects physical health due to sedentary behaviors, including a rise in obesity, sleep disorders and anxiety.
Many of these concerns are connected with wider fears about the effects of the internet and social media on young people, but Ranganathan said we need more research to be sure of the links.
Ranganathan said there were huge positives, too.
Both Ranganathan and Hatzigianni highlighted research showing digital technology interventions are effective in enhancing literacy and numeracy skills, manual dexterity, and visuospatial working memory when used in a learning context.
Studies have found children's use of interactive digital technology enhances language learning, executive function (the ability to focus and get things done) and memory skills.
""We have robotics, coding, language learning, functional literacy, maths. Technology is a tool to help us access information and learning to be creative. It helps hugely with metacognition,"" said Hatzigianni.
Hatzigianni has been working with the Greek government to establish digital learning apps for children in kindergartens aged 4-6 years. Hatzigianni said working to create adaptable learning platforms that involve children, teachers and parents together have been the most successful.
""The right question should be: how are we going to use the right technology to enhance learning and improve teaching, not being scared of it,"" said Hatzigianni.
It's important, said Hatzigianni, for educators to work with children to create healthy digital lives. She criticized the German group for ignoring the input from children: ""It's quite ironic that they say they want to teach more critical thinking and analysis in children, but then they take the choice away from children about their own digital education. Did they ever ask for children's active input?""

https://www.dw.com/en/how-colombias-dirty-coal-fuels-germanys-energy-transition/a-67583407,HUMAN RIGHTS,How Colombia's dirty coal fuels Germany's energy transition 29.11.2023,"""The monster"" pushed Greylis Pinto out, and she says life hasn't really improved since. ""The monster"" is the name local residents give to El Cerrejon, Latin America's largest open-pit coal mine in northern Colombia. Sprawling across an area of 69,000 hectares (about 170,500 acres), or 100,000 football pitches, almost 20 million tons of coal are mined here every year to satisfy the world's hunger for energy, and Germany's as well.
The Colombian government made sure that people like Pinto would not get in the way of the lucrative business of Swiss company Glencore, which acquired the mining rights in 1995 and by 2022 was recording an annual turnover of $256 billion (€233 billion).
Pinto and her Afro-Colombian community of Chancleta were forcibly relocated by Colombian authorities 11 years ago. ""Our current situation is appalling,"" Pinto told DW. ""We now live far away from our native land, where we had everything, most importantly food security. Now we have nothing: no water, no health care and no jobs.""
Pinto is currently on tour in Europe with activists Carolina Matiz and Tatiana Cuenca to draw attention to the precarious situation of the communities that were effectively swallowed up by the ""monster"" and then spat out somewhere else. 
For ""Nueva Chancleta,"" this has meant living on new land that is unsuitable for farming, with unreliable water and gas services and not enough work to earn a living. Colombia's Constitutional Court confirmed in 2015 that the forced resettlement violated the community's rights to a healthy environment, clean drinking water and life.
""Coal has been mined in Cerrejon for 40 years, and the contract allows for another 10 years,"" Tatiana Cuenca, coordinator of the water and mining conflicts program at the Colombian environmental protection organization Censat Agua Vida, told DW. ""And this is in La Guajira, the poorest region of Colombia, where more than 5,000 children died of malnutrition in the last ten years. So when we talk about an energy transition that is supposed to be fair, we have to look at what the consequences of mining have been over the last four decades, which Germany has also benefited from.""
These consequences are laid out point by point in the recent study ""Does Cerrejon Always Win?"" which was co-published by the human rights organization Oxfam: Destruction and pollution of forests, groundwater, and rivers; increases in respiratory diseases and cancer, probably caused by coal dust; frequent attacks targeting activists and no adequate compensation after forced evictions, such as in Chancleta.
Glencore, the world's largest commodities trading and mining group, has denied these accusations, citing the millions the company has paid in taxes, as well as payments made to the region for social and environmental initiatives and the wide distribution of drinking water.
In a statement, Glencore said: ""Glencore is committed to respecting human rights in line with the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights … We uphold the dignity, fundamental freedoms and human rights of our people, communities and others potentially affected by our activities.""
""What is happening in La Guajira in terms of human rights is well documented,"" Carolina Matiz from the human rights organization CINEP told DW. ""But this is not the only thing in Europe we want to draw attention to. We also want to highlight the connections between coal mining, human rights violations and the European financial sector. Glencore operates in Colombia, but it is backed by European banks and insurance companies.""
Since the start of the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Germany has been importing more coal from the United States, Australia and Colombia. Almost 3 million tons have come from the South American country so far in 2023 via deals with German energy companies such as EnBW, Uniper, RWE, and STEAG. German banks and insurance companies have also been involved in the lucrative coal business by providing Glencore with bonds, shares, loans, and guarantees.
Tilman Massa of the Association of Ethical Shareholders Germany told DW that energy companies are obliged to comply with the new Supply Chain Act, which has been in effect in Germany since the start of 2023.
The law requires companies to monitor human rights across their global supply chains, though the financial sector has not yet been included in the law.
""In the case of Glencore and Colombia, this is a litmus test of how effective the law is,"" said Massa. ""The German government must ensure that companies comply with social and environmental standards. And not just minimally on paper, but also in reality.""
In response to the issue, the German Economy Ministry (BMWK) told DW in a statement: ""The BMWK is aware of allegations against the Glencore company from the press and from discussions with Colombian NGOs."" It goes on to say: ""It can be assumed that German coal imports from Colombia will decline in the medium term because Germany will ideally phase out coal-fired power generation by 2030, or by 2038 at the latest.""
In addition, the BMWK said it was supporting Colombia's efforts ""to phase out coal and achieve a socially responsible energy transition, by providing funding and advisory services as part of the International Climate Initiative and through both countries' membership in the international Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA).""
Some would argue that sounds as if Germany is stalling for time in light of the planned phaseout of coal. Glencore is also only expected to mine coal at ""El Cerrejon"" until 2034 when its permit expires. However, the delegation of activists visiting Europe is concerned not only about the effects of open-pit mining over the next decade but also about the years that follow. They fear  Glencore might disappear overnight without fulfilling its obligations to the environment and locals' health.
Claudia Kemfert, head of the Energy, Transportation, Environment Department at the German Institute for Economic Research, said she believes Germany should no longer be importing coal from Colombia — not just because of the Supply Chain Act but also because of Germany's new approach to international policy.
""Such dealings are most certainly not part of a foreign policy driven by values,"" she told DW. ""Of course, we can do without coal from Colombia — there are numerous other coal suppliers in the world. Preferably somewhere with fewer human rights violations and higher environmental standards.""
According to Kemfert, Germany is itself partly to blame for the controversy surrounding dirty coal from Colombia. She said the coal phaseout could have come long ago if the energy transition had not been delayed for so long. The energy expert told DW that she is calling for more transparency in deals such as the one with Colombia, ""But this will also apply to other areas in the future, such as green hydrogen, where similar issues of sustainability and compliance with environmental and social standards will have to be addressed.""

https://www.dw.com/en/niederegger-where-does-german-marzipan-come-from/a-67573836,BUSINESS,Niederegger: Where does German marzipan come from? 28.11.2023,"Marzipan and Lübeck go together like Shakespeare and Stratford. Today, there are four marzipan manufacturers in the old German Hanseatic city. The most famous of which is Niederegger. The company is the epitome of the famous delicacy.
The sweet scent of almonds and chocolate is literally in the air outside the factory. Before entering the production hall, everyone has to disinfect their shoes and hands and put on a white coat and a hairnet.
Inside the factory, the almonds imported from Spain are steamed and shaken until the thick, brown skins fall off. Several employees sit along the assembly line and take bad or poorly peeled nuts off the conveyor belt. The almonds then roll along to the mixing scale. After that, the loud process of mixing, crushing and grinding begins. 
The basic recipe for making the raw mixture is simple: two-thirds almonds and one-third sugar. After that, no additional sugar is added to the raw mixture; many other manufacturers use up to 50% sugar. Importantly, Niederegger's products are considered ""Lübecker Marzipan,"" or marzipan from Lübeck, a term to show where they are from and one protected by EU law.
The marzipan mass ends up in one of 20 rotating copper kettles where the almond and sugar mixture is slowly roasted. A hundred kilos of the granular mass are processed at a time and heated to around 90 degrees Celsius (190 degrees Fahrenheit) until the sugar crystals have melted. Many of the machines here were made over 50 years ago.
""The manufacturing process has remained unchanged for a long time. There is still a lot of manual work involved,"" company spokesperson Kathrin Gaebel explained during a tour.
The marzipan then mass goes to what they call the knitting room where a ""little secret"" is added to the raw mass, Gaebel said. She is not allowed to reveal any more details, but it is probably something similar to rosewater that gives the marzipan its unique taste. Only six people in the company know the exact recipe for Niederegger's biggest secret.
For a long time, marzipan was an expensive delicacy. That is until the beginning of the 19th century when it was discovered that it could be made with beet sugar instead of the more expensive cane sugar. That's why places like Lübeck, with its port and surrounding farmland, had an advantage.
At Niederegger, late summer is when production peaks. While tourists are still frolicking at the Baltic Sea or in outdoor pools, everything here revolves around Christmas. In addition to the 500 permanent employees, another 250 seasonal workers are added to keep up with demand for marzipan Santa Clauses and stars.
The family business has been going for over 200 years. In 1806, master confectioner Johann Georg Niederegger founded a marzipan factory, starting what would become one of the world's most renowned marzipan companies.
The confectioner, born in Ulm in 1777, came to the Hanseatic city in 1800, learned how to make marzipan and developed it further. Until the 18th century, marzipan was considered an exclusive elixir in Lübeck to be used as a medicine for stomach problems or to increase potency.
At that time ""only pharmacists were allowed to make it,"" Gaebel said. ""If you look at old recipe books, marzipan was good for a lot of things. It is mentioned as an aphrodisiac and even good for colds.""
Today, it is clear to nutritionists that any health benefits from marzipan come from the minerals in the almonds, like calcium, potassium and magnesium. They are also rich in vitamin B, which is good for concentration. Almond oil contains polyunsaturated fatty acids that lower cholesterol levels, too.
Marzipan's big disadvantages are its fat content and the tons of sugar that go into it.

Back at the factory, employees shovel the solid pulp into containers where it begins to steam. The mass is cooled with air and nitrogen and vacuum-packed into square blocks. Now the raw material is ready. The company can produce up to 30 tons of it on peak days.
Then it goes into cold storage for a a maturing process where the flavors continue to develop. How long? Well, Gaebel won't say, calling it another company secret.
From the cooling system, the raw marzipan mass goes to the next hall, where machines shape it into pies, bread loaves, stollen, stars, bars and cakes covered with chocolate. Finally, it is packaged.
While much of the production processes consist of manual work, the molding, chocolate coating and packaging are largely done by machines.
For special products, employees on one of the upper floors knock pieces of marzipan out of molds by hand and apply food coloring with brushes. Some Santas even get a hand-painted mouth, hat and sack of toys. To apply these special touches, ""you need patience and a steady hand,"" according to Gaebel. 
The confectionery is exported to over 50 countries. However, 80% of production remains reserved for the German-speaking market. ""Marzipan originally came from the Middle East. Now it is established primarily in Germany and Spain,"" Gaebel said.
Today, nearly 300 different products leave the Niederegger factory every week. Annual sales are said to be over €100 million ($109 million), though there are no official public figures. By the beginning of December, Christmas production is almost finished. But Valentine's Day and Easter are just around the corner and keep the factory busy.
Regardless of the shape or decoration, the marzipan recipe has remained the same since the beginning of the 19th century. Perhaps surprisingly, the original recipe is even displayed in a glass case in the Niederegger cafe in the city center. But don't get any ideas — the secret ingredients are listed on the back — safely out of sight.

https://www.dw.com/en/net-zero-by-2050-9-charts-showing-the-worlds-progress/a-59684637,NATURE AND ENVIRONMENT,Net zero by 2050: 9 charts showing the world's progress 28.11.2023,"To reach net zero CO2 and create carbon-neutral economies, countries have to ensure that for all the CO2 they emit, they remove an equal amount from the atmosphere — or not emit any in the first place. Turning away from coal, oil and gas would be an important first step towards carbon neutrality.
Most economies are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels, while the share of renewables in the mix is growing slowly but steadily.
According to British “Energy Institute”, a business association for companies working in the energy sector, the 2022 regional leaders in energy consumption from renewable sources are Norway in Europe (72%), Brazil in the Americas (49%), New Zealand in the Asia & Pacific region (43%), Morocco in Africa (7%) and Israel in the Middle East (6%).
Meanwhile, countries like Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Trinidad and Tobago, and Turkmenistan still rely on fossil fuels for more than 99% of their energy. At 91%, Poland consumes the highest share of fossil fuel in Europe.
However, the hot spots for coal-fired power plants are located elsewhere. Of the 6,550 operational sites, China is home to 3,115, followed by India (842) and the US (424). Their top three positions are untouched by the fact that they have collectively mothballed, retired and cancelled 3,850 coal-fired plants since 2000, according to the Global Energy Monitor, an NGO curating data on fossil fuel and renewable energy projects worldwide.
To uphold the Paris Agreement, the world needs to withdraw from coal fast. According to the Berlin-based think tank Climate Analytics, it would require an 80% reduction of global 2020 levels — around 9,300 terawatt-hours — to 1,700 TWh before the end of the decade.
The overall energy consumption outlined above is divided into three sectors: energy used for transport, electricity and heating. 
Heat is the largest energy end use, according to an analysis by Paris-based intergovernmental organization, the International Energy Agency (IEA). ""Providing heating for homes, industry and other applications accounts for around half of total energy consumption.""
Currently, about 10% of heat is produced from renewable sources and the IEA projects this share will double by 2030.
In shared rental apartment buildings, choosing the energy source used for heating is not always an option, but consumers generally have a choice when it comes to sourcing electricity.
Countries in the Middle East source the smallest share of their electricity from renewables (3%). Other regions like Africa (23%) and particularly Latin America and the Caribbean (56%) fare much better — especially considering that all three regions produce similar amounts of energy.
Electricity generation is also relevant to the transition of the transportation sector to a carbon-neutral future. Electric vehicles would not be climate friendly if the energy used to charge them was generated using fossil fuels.
Progress is slow. While overall car sales are declining, the vast majority of those sold are still combustion engine models. Of the 74.8 million cars sold in 2022, just 14.4% (almost 11 million) were electric.
For other means of polluting transportation, such as aviation — which accounts for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions alone — no noteworthy alternatives exist yet. That said, Airbus has said it is planning to develop a hydrogen-powered aircraft for commercial travel by 2035.
In short: not well enough. While there have been various forest expansion efforts around the world over the past few decades — peaking between 2000 and 2010, with 10 million new hectares (24.7 million acres) per year — deforestation has occurred at a faster rate.
The net change in forest area over the past decades shows how current efforts to plant new trees in South America and Africa fall far short of making up for those felled.
This is particularly noteworthy since both regions have a leading share in the area of forests within protected areas — calling into question how effective protective areas really are.
 
Renewables are on an upward trajectory. According to the International Energy Agency, other sources of energy attracted more investment than fossil fuels in recent years. While in 2015, more than half of all investments went into fossil fuels, in 2023 this is estimated to be down to a little more than a third.

https://www.dw.com/en/scholz-says-top-courts-budget-ruling-means-new-reality/a-67568774,POLITICS,Scholz says top court's budget ruling means 'new reality' 28.11.2023,"Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, is debating the country's budget shortfall on Tuesday after Chancellor Olaf Scholz's statement to lawmakers.
A gap in government finances emerged after the Constitutional Court earlier this month ruled that unused pandemic funds could not be repurposed for climate and green industry projects.
The court said the state could not rechannel reserve emergency loans for separate post-pandemic projects because this did not meet the constitutional requirements for emergency borrowing — blowing a hole in the government's budget.
Scholz said the ruling would have an impact on Germany's various levels of government from this time on. 
""This ruling creates a new reality — for the federal government and for all current and future governments, federal and state. A reality that, however, it makes important and widely shared goals more difficult for our country to achieve.""
The chancellor admitted that his government would have taken different decisions had this new reality been clear when it took power two years ago.
""With knowledge of the current decision, we would have taken different paths in winter 2021,"" he said. 
Ending his speech, Scholz said he would move forward ""with the necessary calm and with responsibility for our country. That's what I stand for as chancellor."" 

Opposition leader Friedrich Merz, from the conservative Christian Democrats which launched the legal action against the government, said the lawsuit had been justified. He said coalition plans to redesignate the borrowing had been wrong from the beginning.
""This was a lawsuit that had become necessary against the… manipulation of our constitution, which was already written down in your coalition agreement.""
Merz promised to ""keep an eye"" on the government, saying his lawmakers would continue to force the coalition to comply with the constitution.
The German government's three-way ruling coalition on Monday said it would temporarily extend the lifting of constitutionally enshrined restrictions on borrowing as part of a supplementary budget.
The plan included a credit of around €45 billion ($49 billion) to cover funds that had already been spent in 2023. The budget must still be approved by the Bundestag.
The Karlsruhe-based Constitutional Court's ruling had effectively vetoed government plans to funnel €60 billion that was borrowed for a pandemic fund into the Climate and Transformation Fund (KTF).
The gap in finances has posed one of the biggest challenges so far for the coalition of Scholz's center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Green Party, and the business-focused Free Democrats.
It had already been expected that the 2023 supplementary budget would see Germany suspend the debt brake for a fourth year in succession.

The debt brake is part of the German constitution and limits the federal government's structural net borrowing to 0.35% of gross domestic product. It was first adopted in 2009 after the financial crash.
The brake was suspended from 2020 to 2022 during the pandemic and energy crisis but was set to come back into force this year.
Finance Minister Christian Lindner last week said he would declare 2023 a year of emergency so as to put the existing spending plans on a ""firm constitutional footing.""
The court's decision has also cast doubt over the government's 2024 budget, which Scholz on Friday promised would also be finalized by the end of this year.

https://www.dw.com/en/tesla-sues-sweden-over-postal-strike/a-67566370,BUSINESS,Tesla sues Sweden over postal strike 27.11.2023,"Tesla on Monday filed a lawsuit against the Swedish state over a postal workers strike that is hindering deliveries of license plates for the electric carmaker's new vehicles.
The Texas-based automaker is already trying to fend off strike action on several fronts in the Scandinavian country over its refusal to agree to a collective wage agreement for Tesla mechanics.
Last week, postal workers initiated action by blocking deliveries to Tesla offices and repair shops.
As Swedish license plates for new cars are only delivered by mail, the blockade threatens to stop any new Teslas being used in the country for the foreseeable future, a move CEO Elon Musk branded ""insane.""
Tesla said it was suing ""the Swedish state through the Swedish Transport Agency"" because not accessing the registration plates ""constitutes an unlawful discriminatory attack directed at Tesla.""
The 52-year-old South Africa-born US citizen has resisted calls to allow the firm's 127,000 employees around the world to unionize.

However, collective agreements with unions are the basis of the Swedish labor market, covering almost 90% of the country's workforce, safeguarding their salaries as well as working conditions.
Elsewhere in Europe, Musk's anti-union efforts haven't stopped Tesla workers at its Brandenburg plant in Germany from joining the IG Metall union in rising numbers amid concerns around health, safety and overwork.
In October, more than 1,000 Tesla employees demanded better working conditions in a first-time action at the factory in Grünheide, which is in the Municipality of Brandenburg just outside Berlin, according to IG Metall.

https://www.dw.com/en/sierra-leone-now-calm-after-coordinated-series-of-attacks/a-67566141,POLITICS,Sierra Leone now calm after coordinated series of attacks 27.11.2023,"The streets of Sierra Leone's capital Freetown were nearly empty on Monday, with most shops shuttered and school children staying home after a series of attacks, including on a military barrack and an armory.
Security forces were still patroling Freetown's streets and controlling traffic at checkpoints. 
""Monday is usually a very busy day,"" said DW correspondent Murtala Kamara, ""but people are still in fear of what will happen next, so they aren't venturing out.""
This is despite the government easing a curfew imposed nationwide on Sunday and replacing it with an overnight curfew from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.
In the early hours of Sunday, gunmen tried to break into an armory located at the Wilberforce military barracks, the country's largest, located near the presidential villa. They exchanged fire for several hours with forces loyal to the government.
They also targeted several jails, freeing hundreds of prisoners in what the country's information minister, Chernoh Bah, called a ""coordinated set of attacks on major sensitive security and other national installations.""
Residents, including DW correspondent Kamara, reported being woken by the noise of sustained gunfire and explosions.
Information Minister Bah told DW's Africalink program that government forces were able to ""repel the assailants,"" some of whom have been ""apprehended and are currently helping our police and security forces with investigations.""
President Julius Maada Bio ""is in full and complete control of our country,"" Bah said. ""Our security apparatus is functioning, we are increasing our vigilance and the security situation across the country.""

The minister declined to say how many people have been detained or to name those who may have been behind the attacks as investigations are carried out.
Active and former military soldiers were among those involved, the army said in a statement, adding that 13 soldiers loyal to the government had died in the attacks.
While local media is full of conjecture about whether the attacks were a coup attempt, the information minister said there was currently insufficient information to determine whether the intent was to overthrow President Julius Maada Bio.
""It's still a pretty evolving situation, so we're careful not to use a word that we'll may have to walk back on,"" he said.
In an address to the nation on Sunday, President Bio called on the West African country's political and traditional leaders, as well as civil society, to work to preserve peace.
Echoing language used to condemn past coup attempts, the West Africa bloc ECOWAS spoke of its ""utter disgust"" over a ""plot by certain individuals to acquire arms and disturb the peace and constitutional order.""
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, the US embassy in Sierra Leone condemned ""the attempted overnight forceful seizure of Wilberforce Barracks and armory. Such actions have no justification.""
The attacks deepened political tensions in West and Central Africa, where coups have surged, with eight military takeovers since 2020, including in Niger and Gabon this year, and in Guinea, which borders Sierra Leone.

Only last month, Sierra Leone's main opposition party, the All People's Congress (APC), signed an agreement to end its boycott of the government. The APC had refused to take part in any level of government after contested June elections, which saw Bio reelected for a second term.
""We were all excited when the government was able to reach out to the opposition and the two political parties were able to come together and create a stable parliament,"" said Ezekiel Duramany-Lakkoh, a public administration expert and a dean at the University of Sierra Leone.
""It means that outside the normal political structure of government and opposition, there are also other stakeholders that we might be dealing with who are not happy with what we are doing,"" he said.
As to the question of who these other stakeholders might be, Duramany-Lakkoh said it had to be someone capable of a ""major security breach,"" but ""it wasn't good to jump to a quick conclusion.""
However, he pointed out, having so many coups in the region ""gives a lot of incentive or motivation to people who've seen it succeed everywhere, to begin to try and see if it can succeed.""
In August, the police arrested a number of soldiers, including senior officers, who were accused of planning to use protests to launch a violent attack against the president.
The political situation in Sierra Leone has been tense since elections held in June. International observers criticized the ballot count for its inconsistencies and lack of transparency.
In addition, Sierra Leone is suffering from a rapid rise in the cost of living, which has triggered public frustration with Bio and his government.
""It's really tough in Sierra Leone,"" said DW correspondent Kamara. ""People are bitter, life is very, very expensive and people are becoming angry.""

https://www.dw.com/en/malaysia-indonesia-seek-allies-in-eu-deforestation-row/a-67564595,POLITICS,"Malaysia, Indonesia seek allies in EU deforestation row 27.11.2023","Malaysia and Indonesia want to bring other Southeast Asian countries on their side amid ongoing disputes with the European Union over environmental and deforestation regulations that are set to take effect in late 2024, with the two nations worried about the regulations' impact on the region's agriculture exports.
Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said earlier this month that his Thai counterpart, Srettha Thavisin, ""has given me the assurance that Thailand would come on board to work together with Malaysia and Indonesia, and hopefully other countries, in presenting our case, particularly to the EU.""
Indonesia and Malaysia, which together account for around 85% of global palm oil production, argue that the EU Deforestation-Free Regulation is discriminatory and unfairly punishes small-scale farmers who will struggle to cope with the bureaucratic demands set by Brussels.
The EU's regulation will ban imports of cattle, cocoa, coffee, palm oil, rubber, soy and wooden items if they are produced on land that was found to have been deforested after December 31, 2020.
Both Southeast Asian states have independently initiated complaints against the EU to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Whereas Jakarta has accused Brussels of ""regulatory imperialism"" and Malaysian producers have bemoaned ""crop apartheid,"" other Southeast Asian states have taken a more diplomatic approach, seeking to understand the EU directives unilaterally in one-on-one discussions with EU officials.
Southeast Asian governments and producers are most concerned about the incoming EU bureaucratic hurdles necessary to prove their products haven't been grown on deforested land.
Under the new EU directive, local companies will have to provide extensive mapping of their entire supply chains, including geolocation data.
According to the EU's terms, these compliance mechanisms will be mandatory for larger companies from December 2024 and a few months later for smaller firms.

""The issue of perception is crucial. If the EU's intentions are perceived as illegitimate, policies may be met with skepticism, seen as regulatory imperialism or disguised protectionism,"" said Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade.
""Active engagement with the countries through, for example, their embassies in Brussels is key,"" Lange told DW. ""I have started such a process and already learned a lot. Understanding specific concerns is essential for finding solutions.""
Thailand is the world's third-largest producer of palm oil, after Indonesia and Malaysia. It is also a significant exporter of other products, such as timber, cocoa and rubber, that EU regulations will impact.
The country is also the world's biggest rubber producer, and exports of these goods to the EU were worth €1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) last year, according to government data. Malaysia currently sells around 17% of its rubber products to the EU. Vietnam is another major rubber exporter focused on the European bloc.
According to Thai government estimates, small-scale palm oil accounts for 70% of the country's production. But EU officials contend that the deforestation regulation targets large-scale illegal deforestation, not smallholders.
Bridget Welsh, an honorary research associate at the University of Nottingham Asia Research Institute Malaysia, reckons the chances are ""reasonably good"" that Thailand will join Indonesia and Malaysia's campaign as they ""are concerned with the issue and leaning away from the EU in their foreign policy.""
However, a Thai government official, who requested anonymity because they were not permitted to talk about the issue, told DW it was improbable that Bangkok would join Malaysia and Indonesia in any legal complaints against Brussels, not least because Thailand this year gave the go-ahead to restart stalled talks over a free-trade agreement with the EU.
Instead, Thailand would become more vocal about the economic impacts of the EU directive and perhaps join Malaysia and Indonesia's Joint Task Force set up in June with the European Union that saw its first roundtable discussions in August, the official said.
Chris Humphrey, executive director of the EU-ASEAN Business Council, said his organization has long been worried ""about the possibility of concerns from Southeast Asian nations on the EU Green Deal escalating into a significant trade dispute.""
""There are legitimate concerns over implementation, but equally, the objectives of the policies are also legitimate,"" Humphrey added.
""It is clear to us that more needs to be done to bridge the gap between both the EU and ASEAN, but that is being done now and hopefully will prevent a further escalation of the dispute.""

Indeed, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur have steered away from their legal challenges and now seem more focused on negotiations with Brussels to lessen the impact of green directives on their economies.
As part of a new forum established this year, the two countries are lobbying the EU to be classified as low-risk countries for deforestation, which would simplify due diligence procedures for their companies. Countries deemed a high risk will still have more rigorous checks.
They also want the EU's demands to conform to the international standard laid out in 2004, under the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, and to match deforestation laws of national governments.
""It is now our common responsibility to find a solution to regional concerns about the ability of smaller Southeast Asian suppliers to compete,"" said David McAllister, chair of the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs.
""This should be done in a non-patronizing tone of mutual respect,"" he told DW.
""Through joint certification, the Joint Task Force that brings producing countries and the European Commission together, as well as through financial support for forest partnerships, we can make meaningful progress.""
According to a European Commission official speaking on condition of anonymity, the EU is ""significantly stepping up its engagement … to ensure the new law is effectively implemented while working in partnership with producer countries.""
The official said a new initiative related to these disputes will be launched at COP28, which is set to begin in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.

https://www.dw.com/en/in-georgia-journalism-is-no-longer-considered-safe/a-67512993,PRESS FREEDOM,"In Georgia, 'journalism is no longer considered safe' 26.11.2023","There are just seconds to go until the start of the 6 p.m. show on Mtavari TV, and a small team has crowded into the control room on a side street in the capital, Tbilisi. After a few final instructions, host Mikheil Sesiashvili is on air. The big news this evening is an accident at the university, though no was one was hurt.
Mtavari TV decides for itself what and how it reports. The channel's staff of roughly 300 has fought hard to make it that way. They set up shop in 2019 in a rebellion against their former employer, whose editorial line was, in their view, too friendly to the government.
The work isn't easy, as Sesiashvili explained. ""I'm hosting a show on a broadcaster whose managing director spent one year and three months in prison for political reasons,"" he said.
He hadn't committed any crimes, but he was critical of the government, added Sesiashvili. ""And everyone here in this building is thinking: maybe I'm next.""
In May 2022, Mtavari TV managing director Nika Gvaramia was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison. His sentence related to the alleged private use of his company car, which judges argued had financially harmed the broadcaster. But many suspected a political motivation.
The European Union has called on Georgia to release Gvaramia, most recently in its regular review of whether EU accession candidates, including Georgia, fulfill the conditions to start negotiations. At the end of June, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili pardoned Gvaramia.
Nonetheless, Sesiashvili can't shake the daily thought that journalists can randomly end up in jail. ""It's difficult, but we colleagues try to keep each others spirits up and to concentrate on why we are doing this job. I call us freedom fighters, because we are fighting for a more democratic, freer Georgia,"" he said.
More freedom, more democracy. These are the values that bind Georgia with the EU. When surveyed, more than 80% of Georgians frequently express support for joining the bloc. Graffiti with EU flags and slogans like ""We are Europe"" adorn walls all over Tbilisi.
In early November, when the European Commission recommended that the 27 member states give Georgia EU candidate status, spontaneous celebrations broke out in the capital city.
But there was a catch: Of the 12 priority criteria where EU officials had previously identified room for improvement, Georgia had only fulfilled three.
The government needed to improve its track record on press freedom and media independence, officials in Brussels warned. But the government in Tbilisi appears unmoved. Earlier this year, it passed a law that made it easier to revoke journalists' parliamentary accreditation. As a result, posing a difficult question twice in a row can see reporters denied access to the legislature.
Mariam Gersamia, a researcher at Transparency International Georgia, has called the bill a ""bureaucratic scalpel."" In her job, there aren't many positive developments to report. ""We see campaigns to discredit journalists and we observe the demonization of the job,"" she said.
""Independent journalists get vilified as supporters of certain political parties, politicians refuse to give interviews to outlets that don't toe their line,"" she added. All this leads to more polarization, not only in the media landscape but in society at large.
Sesiashvili said he has frequently invited government figures as guests on to his show, but they never show up. But the outlet has another, more pressing problem: it's broke. Staff wages have only been secured for the next four months, and new sources of income are hard to come by.
""I know a lot of managing directors and company owners in Georgia that shy away from advertising with us,"" said Sesiashvili. ""They're scared of having problems with the government, for example with unusual tax office audits. And unfortunately I have to say that their fears are well grounded.""
Gersamia of Transparency International said the government-funded state-owned broadcaster is in a particularly advantageous position: it receives more money from the government alone than all other broadcasters together earn from advertising.
In northern Tbilisi, away from the dazzling Rustaveli Avenue with its international fashion chain stores and the Old Town so beloved by tourists, lies the headquarters of Formula TV — a channel with links to the political opposition.
This is where Misha Mshvildadze films his weekly satire show. The tall, stout entertainer is not one to hold his tongue. This has made him popular with many Georgians, though certainly not everyone.
In June, he was leaving the office in the evening, as usual, when he was followed and beaten up by several men on the busy street. Mshvildadze said they repeatedly hit him in the eye, and he believes the aim of the attack was not to inflict serious injuries, but to make sure his injuries were clearly visible.
""Everyone knows me in this country. So attacking me in public sends a message to everyone here: If I'm not safe, no one is safe. And anyone who expresses criticism must expect to be punished,"" he said.
Colleagues tried to find the perpetrators, reconstructing the attack and analyzing surveillance camera footage. They came to the conclusion that the attack had been orchestrated by the Georgian secret service. A man employed by the secret service was eventually convicted for the attack, but the head of the service has denied that the perpetrator acted on official orders.
""Journalism is no longer considered safe in Georgia,"" said Gersamia of Transparency International. ""Nor is it a job that promises popularity. Instead, journalists are seen as annoying.""
The number of people changing careers is alarming, she added — not a good sign for a country where many harbor ardent EU aspirations.

https://www.dw.com/en/chinese-tourists-return-with-an-eye-on-budget-safety/a-67407148,BUSINESS,"Chinese tourists return with an eye on budget, safety 26.11.2023","Nearly a year after Beijing said goodbye to zero-COVID — its strict policy of lockdowns and quarantines to contain the spread of the coronavirus — the Chinese public are traveling internationally again in large numbers.
In the first half of 2023, the number of outbound tourists from mainland China reached 40.3 million, according to official statistics. That figure is expected to have grown further in the latter half of the year.
But it's still a far cry from 155 million outbound trips taken by mainland Chinese tourists in 2019 before the pandemic struck.
The Chinese have been a major boon to global tourism as they are regularly the world's highest-spending visitors, enjoying luxury hotels, tours, souvenirs and designer brands.
In 2019, Chinese tourists spent $255 billion (€235 billion) while overseas, according to business consultancy McKinsey & Company. The figure is almost twice as much as Americans, three times more than Germans and almost four times the spending of British tourists.
But with the Chinese economy struggling to recover fully from the pandemic, depleted household savings from a worsening real estate crisis and 20% youth unemployment eating into family budgets, Chinese tourists are becoming a lot more cost-conscious.
A survey from London earlier this month found that the number of Chinese tourists to the UK capital was just 2% shy of the 2019 figure. But their spending was down by 58%, according to the New West End Company, a firm set up to promote the interests of London's West End, where many tourist attractions are located.
The lobby group is keen for the UK government to reinstate tax-free shopping for non-European Union tourists, which was scrapped in 2020. The offer allowed tourists to reclaim the 20% sales tax (VAT) paid on purchases as they leave the country.
Market research firm Tourism Economics put the fall in average spending per visit down to the growing number of independent Chinese travelers, replacing those who normally visit in large tour groups. But the firm said it was likely a short-term blip.
""The continued expected rise in incomes and emerging travel class means that over the next 10 years, we expect that there will be an additional 60 million Chinese households per year looking to travel both within China and internationally,"" Dave Goodger, managing director for the Europe and Middle East at Tourism Economics, told DW.

He said during that period, China is expected to make the greatest contribution to long-haul travel growth to Europe in terms of visits and spending, overtaking the US as the most important growth market.
While so-called revenge travel — where consumers prioritize overseas travel after long COVID lockdowns — has buoyed European and US tourism hot spots from travelers based closer to home, Tourism Economics found that long-haul trips to destinations across Europe remain 43% below pre-pandemic levels. Travelers from Asia, and in particular China, are noticeably missing.
Goodger thinks a full recovery of Chinese tourists to Europe could take up to two years, although other research firms think it could happen sooner.
""We anticipate that Chinese travel volumes will regain 2019 levels in 2025,"" he told DW. ""Recovery to long-haul destinations is not expected until 2026, especially for travel to Europe, given the ongoing war in Ukraine and the Middle East.""
Other regions and countries are also keen to revive the number of arrivals from China. Thailand, for example, welcomed 11 million Chinese nationals in 2019, but in the first nine months of this year saw fewer than 2.5 million. The Thai government had predicted double that figure.
In September, Thailand waived visa requirements for Chinese nationals. And after a shooting last month at a luxury Bangkok mall killed two people, including a Chinese national, the Thai government proposed joint Thai-Chinese police patrols to help restore the confidence of tourists from Asia's largest economy.
Chinese social media networks have been awash with video footage showing attacks on Chinese tourists abroad and the details of the abuse of Chinese workers, many of whom were lured for high-paying jobs in Asia that turned out to be scams. This phenomenon was also highlighted in the popular Chinese movie ""No More Bets,"" which was released in August.
In another concerning incident, a bus carrying 41 Chinese nationals was attacked by masked protesters in the southern French city of Marseille in the summer, leaving several injured. The attack prompted an angry rebuke by Beijing.
As COVID first emerged in China, many Chinese travelers were also concerned about venturing abroad for fear of Sinophobia, amid calls by some Western politicians for reparations.
""Perceptions of safety are crucial in destination choice and in determining which destinations have seen the most rapid recovery,"" Goodger told DW, adding that short-haul travel and more familiar destinations within Asia have been quickest to see a rebound.
Another factor keeping Chinese tourists away until recently was the need for COVID tests to enter many countries, and Goodger said Chinese nationals have also been affected by backlogs of visa and passport applications. This has happened despite a staggered reopening of outbound travel by Beijing.
The phased restoration of international flights from Chinese airports is also slowing the recovery. In November, there were 4,778,271 seats on international flights in and out of China, a 43% decline from during the same period in 2019, according to global travel data provider OAG.
OAG data showed that flights from China to South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan were recovering much faster than those to France, Italy and the US, but all were still far below their pre-COVID levels.

https://www.dw.com/en/from-stripteases-to-sky-burials-the-mystery-of-the-funeral/a-67540516,SOCIETY,From stripteases to sky burials — the mystery of the funeral 25.11.2023,"The pharaohs of ancient Egypt were embalmed, as were several other rulers in later centuries. This includes France's Louis XIV, also known as Louis the Great or the Sun King, and the communist leader Lenin, whose preserved body has been on public display since shortly after his death in 1924. Even today, there are still cultures that embalm their dead, while others bury, burn or dismember the corpse as illustrated in some burial ceremionies below. 
In the middle of the Tibetan highlands, vultures flock hungrily around a dismembered corpse. The ""Ragyapas"" — the Buddhist morticians — have left the body for them to eat. They follow the ancient tradition of a sky burial — when a person dies, they are symbolically fed for a few days while a monk reads to them from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. This is the holy man's way of persuading the soul to leave the body.
On the day of the funeral, the Lama — a title for a teacher of the Dharma in Tibetan Buddhism — invokes the deceased one last time before the body is taken to the burial site before sunset. The Ragyapas dismember the body and split the head so that the soul can escape. It is then the task of the vultures to carry the deceased into the ""bardo,"" the intermediate realm between death and rebirth.
Hinduism also believes that every person is reborn many times. A dead person must therefore be cremated as soon as possible, because only then can their soul free itself from the body and move on. In India, the River Ganges plays a special role in this. According to religion, it is sacred, as it is said the river flows from the sacred locks of the god Shiva. Those who bathe here are freed from all sins. This is also the reason why numerous funeral pyres are erected on the riverbank for the dead. After cremation, relatives collect the ashes and scatter them in the Ganges, accompanied by flowers and garlands. They hope that the deceased will thus escape the eternal cycle of birth, death and rebirth and enter nirvana, a state in which the soul finally comes to rest.
Around 100,000 burials take place on the Ganges every year. Cleansing for the soul, but not for the river, as it is one of the most polluted rivers in the world.
Elsewhere, a burial is more popular, but not all coffins are the same. In Ghana, for example, coffin art symbolizes what was important to the deceased in life: Did he work as a musician in a band? Then the coffin can be ordered in the shape of a guitar. Was he a bar owner? Why not a final resting place in the shape of a beer bottle? There are no limits to the imagination.
Even more expensive, however, are the burial ceremonies of the Toraja mountain tribe in Indonesia. In order for the soul of the deceased to find its way to the land of the dead — Puya — it needs the help of the living. The tribe believes this is necessary because if it gets lost and wanders between the worlds, it can become a threat to those left behind.
After their death, the deceased are first embalmed and laid out in the family home. Sometimes only for a few weeks, sometimes for years, because the relatives save up for a grand funeral feast lasting several days to enable the soul to make its way to the afterlife. The higher the social status of the deceased, the more extensive the celebrations.
Hundreds of guests come together, all of whom have to be entertained and accommodated. Numerous animals are slaughtered at the funeral ceremony, but water buffalo is the preferred choice. For the Toraja tribe, they are not only a symbol of power and wealth, but are also said to help the dead find their way to the afterlife. Cockfights are also part of the ritual.
The highlight of the ceremony is the actual burial. The deceased is hung from a rock face in an elaborately carved wooden coffin or laid out in a cave carved into the rock. There is room for whole families here. In front of the rock tombs, wooden figures called tau-taus, which are supposed to represent the deceased, stand on a balcony.
In the African island state of Madagascar, the dead are just as much a part of the family as the living. And these ""Razana"" have a very special gift — they can speak with the gods. It is therefore a good idea to have them on your side as mediators, as angering the ancestors can cause misfortune and harm the whole family.
However, disgruntled Razana can be appeased at the ""Famadihana"" festival for the dead. Sometimes they set the date themselves by appearing to a relative in a dream. In most cases, however, an ""Ombiasy,"" a Malagasy healer, contacts the dead to determine the right time for the Famadihana, to which the extended family, neighbors and friends are invited. On the feast day, the deceased are then wrapped in precious silk scarves and the living and the dead are introduced to each other. The hosts serve sumptuous food and toaka gasy, home-brewed rum. There is a lot of drinking, laughing and dancing. And when the deceased are then returned to the cleaned and newly painted tomb, they are laid to rest. Until the next Famadihana. As a rule, such a festival only takes place every three to seven years, as it is very elaborate and costly.
Many Asian countries also pay homage to their ancestors. Families set up shrines at home and honor the deceased with flowers and incense sticks.
In Japan, there is a three-day ancestor festival called ""Obon"" every year in mid-August. According to Buddhist belief, the dead return from the afterlife to their homes and families once a year, and they must be given a proper welcome. To help them find their way, welcome fires or lanterns are lit on the house altar in the gardens. The bereaved make daily food offerings to their ancestors, including ""farewell dumplings."" The symbolic feeding is intended to alleviate the suffering of the dead, who may be starving.
According to popular belief, the deceased ride back to the afterlife at the end of the Obon, which is why families make them mounts from cucumbers or eggplants; chopsticks are used as legs. These are either placed on the altar or in front of the door. The farewell is once again marked by fire. Flames in the form of characters light up the mountain slopes while floating lanterns sway gently on rivers and lakes.
The Obon is now a popular festival where almost the entire country is on its feet to greet the ancestors in their hometown.
In Taiwan, relatives like to order an ""Electric Flower Car"" for the funeral. This is a truck trailer decorated with lots of flowers and bright flashing lights, on which scantily clad women dance for the deceased and the mourners. If necessary, a converted jeep will do. Loud pop music blares from the loudspeakers. 
This somewhat strange custom only became established in the 1970s. Apparently, the Taiwanese underworld sensed a good business opportunity at the time. As partners in funeral homes, they simply offered strippers from their nightclubs as part of a cheap ""funeral package."" This would attract more mourners, which would in-turn please the gods. The dancers are also a gift to the dead who enjoyed themselves while they were alive.
In the big cities, the ""Electric Flower Cars"" are usually frowned upon as immoral, but in the countryside, they remain popular.
In Germany, as in most countries around the world, such an event would be unthinkable. Here, the deceased are either buried in a coffin or an urn, moving speeches are given and the mourners throw soil or flower petals into the grave as a farewell.
Afterwards, people gather together for coffee and cake at a funeral reception to symbolize that life goes on. The dead are then remembered on Christian feast days such as the Catholic All Souls' Day on November 2 or the Protestant Sunday of the Dead, which falls on November 26 this year. Also known as Eternity Sunday, it usually falls on the last Sunday of the Protestant church's liturgical year. On both these days, people visit the graves of their loved ones and put up grave lights.
However, the memory of the deceased is present in all cultures, regardless of how it is celebrated.

At the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum (CASCF) in June 2014, the Chinese president greeted guests using the Arabic ""As-Salaam-Alaikum,"" meaning ""peace be unto you,"" before addressing the forum about China's cooperation with the Arab world and the political future of the Palestinian territories.
In his speech, which he continued in Chinese, Xi emphasized that China ""strongly supports the peace process in the Middle East and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with full sovereignty, based on the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital.""
""We hope that the parties involved will take concrete measures to remove obstacles to peace talks.""
He ended his speech with ""Shukran,"" or thank you in Arabic, and received great applause.
Nine years later, with tensions between Israel and Palestinians the worst they've been in decades, Xi addressed the topic again, this time at a virtual special summit of the BRICS states on Tuesday.
The special summit addressing the conflict in the Middle East was chaired by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. In attendance was Russian President Vladimir Putin and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. 

Xi's position has remained constant. He has called for an ""immediate ceasefire"" in the war between Israel and the militant group Hamas and for the release of ""civilian prisoners.""
Without a ""comprehensive, just and sustainable solution to the Palestinian question, there will be no lasting peace"" in the Middle East, said Xi.
China welcomed Israel's war cabinet agreeing to a ceasefire this week. Egypt and Qatar played a key role in brokering the agreement between the two parties, something that required major diplomatic effort.
At a summit in Beijing on Monday of Arab and Muslim foreign ministers to discuss solutions toward ending the Israel-Hamas war, top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi met with his counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Indonesia and the Palestinian Authority.
""This is a strong expression of confidence to visit China as the first stop for your mediation in the international community,"" Wang said. ""We have a tradition of understanding and supporting each other.""
BRICS is a grouping of the world's largest emerging economies. The special summit held this week was the first time the group has met to address an ongoing crisis.
The occasion poses a big opportunity for China, which is not content with its status as the world's second-largest economy. China wants political influence. 
""In the current situation, it is high time for the BRICS states to speak out promptly on the issue of Palestinians and Israel and articulate justice and peace,"" Xi said in his video address on Tuesday.
China's head of state praised the ""BRICS Plus"" format as a platform on which the emerging economies can ""strengthen cooperation and defend common interests.""
""Today, we coordinated our positions on the issue between Palestinians and Israel and decided on joint actions. This is a good start for cooperation in the larger 'BRICS Plus' format,"" he added.
The meeting was also a first for the potential new BRICS member states added after the 2023 summit in August, Egypt, Argentina, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The new members, who should start joining officially from early next year, have one thing in common: They are all official supporters of China's Silk Road Initiative (BRI).
China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) comprises a global trade network that is intended reorganize world trade more favorably towards China's geopolitical interests.
However, Markus Taube doubts that this initiative will remain successful in the long term. The economics professor specializing in East Asia at the University of Duisburg-Essen has put forward a provocative thesis: ""The BRI is dead. Long live the BRICS format.""
The BRI ""was created in the win-win interpretation phase of global cooperation, within the framework of fair-weather globalization,"" said Taube.
""The BRI relies on the joint development of infrastructure and joint development of business models. This is no longer feasible today. The global narrative has changed. The BRI can no longer be sold and marketed in this form and format,"" he added.
The BRI will not die because it is in the Chinese Communist Party (CPP) constitution. But BRI projects could increasingly be shifted to other initiatives and other programs.
At the same time, however, BRICS is becoming ""one of the most important vehicles for the foreign policy and economic propagation of Chinese interests, especially in the global South,"" said Taube.
""The BRICS group of states is completely changing its character,"" the economics professor told a lecture at the end of October.

For Germany and, above all, for the German economy, political changes in China could not only have implications for business in China, but also for business in third countries, said Taube.
""BRICS is the central crystallization point of Chinese foreign and foreign trade policy.""
Incidentally, the BRICS states are referred to as ""gold bars"" in Chinese, while the ""BRICS Plus"" are called the ""big gold bars.""
In Beijing's interpretation of the 21st century, political influence is the currency that China is currently struggling for, in what Beijing calls ""great golden influences"" in an anti-Western and anti-colonial alliance, which is how China understands BRICS.
""Decoding China"" is a DW series that examines Chinese positions and arguments on current international issues from a critical German and European perspective.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-activists-launch-black-friday-campaign-against-amazon/a-67540370,BUSINESS,German activists launch Black Friday campaign against Amazon 24.11.2023,"The German artist-activist Peng! Collective greeted the traditional shopping frenzy of Black Friday Week with a campaign aimed at the online retailer Amazon and what one Peng member called its ""Soviet"" business model.
In keeping with Peng's ambition to create an ""explosive concoction of activism, hacking, and art,"" the campaign is a four-pronged attack: A Black Friday protest outside the ""Amazon Tower"" building in Berlin, an online petition, a satirical Amazon-themed ""circus"" created by the Rimini Protokoll theater group, and an ""Amazon Leaks"" page, where the company's employees can report alleged abuses at the company.
But, according to Jean Peters, Peng spokesperson, investigative journalist and veteran of several Peng stunts, the reported working conditions are just a symptom of the basic problem: Amazon's colossally successful business model.
This, he claims, is unique, as it relies on monopolizing access to customers, forcing small retailers to give up huge percentages to sell on its marketplace and, above all, exploiting an army of small subcontractors whose employees have only limited-time contracts and few workers' rights.
There are well-known issues with subcontractor chains: Delivery companies like Amazon, Hermes, and FedEx use subcontractors who often contract even smaller companies. Some of these operations, according to Rory Linton, spokesman for Germany's second largest trade union Verdi, are in fierce competition to undercut each other, and are so small that they only employ two or three people and only exist for a short time. ""They know they can't fulfill the contracts if they have correct health and safety and pay a decent wage, so the big companies get rid of the responsibility,"" he said.
Linton describes cases reported to the union where subcontractors did not allow their workers to turn on the Amazon app that records their working hours for the first and last hours of their shift. Not only that, Amazon stipulates that its ""Freight Partners"" in Germany can only operate a maximum of ten trucks, which, according to Verdi, both restricts any chance of competition and ensures that delivery drivers cannot organize effectively.
""With subcontractors there are almost no checks and balances in terms of workers' rights, health and safety,"" Linton told DW. ""Often workers get less than minimum wage.""
Verdi wants an outright ban on subcontractors in the postal package industry, a proposal that has already been echoed by some of Germany's state governments.
There has been a backlash in the industry. Frank Huster, head of the logistics industry association DSLV, which represents big hauling companies, says a ban would only have a disruptive effect on supply chains. ""Any freight forwarder subcontracts transport companies on a regular basis. If precarious employment relationships are found at transport companies, this must be remedied in the internal relationship [between employer and employee] and not by a general ban on commissioning transport service providers,"" he told DW.
A ban would be a very bad idea, according to Sebastian Hassler, who has spent 20 years running several small and medium-sized logistics firms whose clients include Amazon and other major companies.
""That won't solve the problem,"" he told DW. ""Just because there are a few black sheep, who I believe are a minority — to ban the entire industry because of that! That's my livelihood, and we pay taxes and social contributions and treat people decently.""
He also thinks banning the contracts like the ones he has with Amazon would only concentrate more power in the larger companies' hands, as it would force delivery drivers to work directly for the major corporations.
Hassler says there's plenty to criticize about Amazon: ""I'm also critical of the fact that Amazon has this market dominance, and it's clear that it's getting tougher for mid-sized companies,"" he said. ""And we know that Amazon pays very little tax, and I don't agree with that either.""
And yet: ""If I compare the big players, Amazon is actually the fairest,"" he added. ""Amazon tells us how much we have to pay our drivers, and it's way over the minimum wage. And we have to prove the number of hours they worked.""
He also says that in his experience, Amazon is among the quickest of the big companies to cancel contracts if compliance rules are broken.
The problem with subcontractors, according to industry representatives DW spoke to, had more to do with the state's failure to catch law-breaking companies. 
Marten Bosselmann, head of the German Parcel and Express Association (BIEK), argues that there are already plenty of workers' rights protection laws in place. ""The big package delivery service providers are not law enforcement authorities,"" he told DW. ""We would like to see more controls and the people who break the rules, who don't pay their workers properly, they have to be taken out of circulation.""
Activists, meanwhile, insist that Amazon's market dominance and all-consuming business model — funneling retailers and customers through its platform while keeping subcontractors small — suffocates competition.
""Amazon is a kind of microcosm of a radical planned economy to concentrate profits for a few people,"" said Jean Peters of Peng! ""With Amazon we have a planned economy with total surveillance of all the workers and all the products, in a way the Soviets could only dream of. And all of that is done not for the redistribution of wealth, but for profit.""
Amazon rejects all these claims, saying that it is in competition with several other major retailers, and that its marketplace model actually helps small businesses.
""The fact is that Amazon has created millions of good jobs while supporting hundreds of thousands of small businesses around the world,"" an Amazon spokesperson told DW in a statement. ""We offer our employees good wages and benefits, attractive career opportunities and a modern and safe working environment for all.""
Olaf Scholz's government is drawing up a new postal services law that will apparently include a crackdown on subcontractor abuses. ""Non-transparent sub-subcontractor relationships and repeated violations of labor and social law requirements give reason to expand the legal instruments,"" the Economy Ministry said in January 2023.
Some 30,000 postal workers took to the streets of Berlin in October 2023 to demand action, and Amazon workers have gone on strike on Black Friday before.
And there is a precedent for action on subcontractor abuses: The government moved fast to crack down on meat industry subcontractors after a major scandal in 2020 revealed the exploitation of workers at the meat processing company Tönnies.
Jean Peters is not holding his breath, though. He believes the Green Party, responsible for the Economy Industry, would like to see stronger regulations on subcontractors, but fears that the governing coalition's Free Democrats (FDP), led by Finance Minister Christian Lindner, will try to protect Amazon's interests. ""We'll see,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-economy-contracts-in-3rd-quarter/a-67539835,BUSINESS,German economy contracts in 3rd quarter 24.11.2023,"Germany's economy contracted slightly in the third quarter of 2023, official data from the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) showed Friday.
Gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.1% compared with the 2nd quarter.
""After the weak development in the first half of the year, the German economy started the second half of 2023 with a slight contraction,"" said Ruth Brand, President of the Federal Statistical Office.
In the first two quarters, economic output effectively stagnated, with the 1st quarter showing zero growth and the 2nd quarter showing 0.1% growth.
Despite inflation falling sharply in recent months to 3.8% in October from 6.1% in August and over 10% last year, price rises continued to be a burden for German consumers over the summer, who appear to be limiting their spending.
Consumer spending, which makes up around two-thirds of German GDP, fell 0.3% in the third quarter.
German exports fell by 0.8%, while imports dropped even more sharply by 1.3%
The data means Germany now has one foot in recession. If output shrinks in the fourth quarter too, the economy will officially have entered a technical recession.

Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, expects a continued dip in growth in the fourth quarter but said in a recent statement that ""slight growth"" will return in the first quarter of 2024.
Backing up that forecast, the Munich-based IfO Institute said Friday its business climate index had increased by 0.4 points to 87.3. points, compared to the previous month.
The index monitors the mood in German boardrooms through a monthly survey of around 9,000 executives. It has been climbing for three months in a row.
Economists, meanwhile, are more worried about a Constitutional Court ruling last week that the German government's plan to divert 60 billion in unused debt from the pandemic era to its climate and transformation fund was unconstitutional.
""Should the federal government decide to actually make [public sector] cuts to replace the billions now missing due to the Constitutional Court ruling ... to offset tax increases, the risk increases that the German economy will shrink again in 2024,"" said Sebastian Dullien, director of the Dusseldorf-based IMK Institute.
Dullien warned of a burden to consumption and business investments and that unemployment would likely rise noticeably.
Others see the GDP reading as a further sign of a more structural sluggishness in the German economy.
""Today's data will do little to end the debate about whether or not the German economy is the sick man of Europe again,"" said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Bank. ""In any case, the German economy has become one of the growth losers in the eurozone.""

https://www.dw.com/en/slovakia-robert-ficos-cabinet-includes-some-controversial-appointments/a-67539940,POLITICS,Slovakia: Robert Fico's cabinet includes some controversial appointments 24.11.2023,"When President Zuzana Caputova appointed the new Slovak government led by Robert Fico on October 25, she expressed hope it would represent all citizens — including those who had not voted for Fico's Smer-SD party.
Indeed, the majority of the Slovak electorate did not vote for the nominally left-leaning Smer party, which garnered only 23% of votes in the election on September 30. But even this low result was enough for Smer to become the biggest party and form a new coalition government with the far-right Slovak National Party (SNS) and the left-wing Hlas.
It was also enough to propel 59-year-old Fico, who had resigned as prime minister in 2018 during the political crisis that followed the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancée, back to the political front line.
Several of those who now sit around the cabinet table — and indeed a number of those who now hold senior ministerial posts — have faced accusations of establishing criminal groups within state structures. DW takes a closer look at some of the more controversial figures in Fico's government. 
Four-time prime minister and leader of the (nominally) social democratic Smer-SD party, Fico rose to power in 2006. At the time, he was a very different politician to the pro-Russian, Orban-style leader we see today.
In 2018, for instance, he said: ""We are the EU. If we talk about Slovakia, we also talk about the priorities of the European Union … There is nothing better than the EU. There just isn't.""
This statement came a day after the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancée Martina Kusnirova. Kuciak was an investigative journalist who had been working on uncovering alleged tax fraud committed by high-profile businessmen linked to political parties such as Smer. Fico was forced to resign in the fallout from Kuciak's murder.
Both he and his party have been accused of widespread corruption, which paved the way for the election victory of the anti-corruption OLANO party (now called Movement Slovakia) in 2020. This was the first election Smer lost in almost 15 years.
After the new OLANO-led government made major personnel changes in the police, judiciary and the public prosecutor's office, members of Smer suddenly faced serious accusations of corruption and forming criminal groups within state structures.
According to media reports, Robert Fico and Robert Kalinak were the ringleaders in all this. The attorney general later dismissed the charges on the grounds that the police did not have enough evidence against the two politicians.
Fico is not the only one to make a political comeback. His ally and confidant Robert Kalinak, who was also implicated in the corruption allegations, is now defense minister.
Kalinak had served as interior minister in Fico's last cabinet, however, President Caputova had signaled on television shortly after September's election that she would not appoint him to this position again: ""If an accused person were to become interior minister, I would consider that a very questionable appointment,"" she said.
Now at the helm of the Defense Ministry, Kalinak owns a company called Liwa Arms that makes hunting rifles. According to its website, the company aspires to boost not only Slovak regional trade but also international business. Its parent company is based in the United Arab Emirates.
The position of interior minister has been given to a young politician from the left-wing Hlas party, Matus Sutaj Estok.
Slovakia's new culture minister is Martina Simkovicova. The 52-year-old journalist and former TV news anchor is a member of the far-right Slovak National Party (SNS). Simkovicova was fired by the Slovak television channel Markiza, where she had worked for almost 18 years, for sharing anti-migrant content on social media. From Markiza, she moved to the television channel TV Slovan, which is well known for peddling conspiracy theories and disinformation.
In one of her first speeches as culture minister, Simkovicova stressed that she is against mixing Slovak and foreign cultures: ""The culture of the Slovak people should be Slovak — Slovak and no other. We tolerate other cultures, but our culture is not a mixture of other cultures,"" she said.
With many artists and independent creatives in Slovakia signing a petition protesting her appointment, she has certainly not been greeted with open arms by the sector for which her ministry is responsible.
Tomas Taraba was not SNS's first choice for the post of environment minister. It had hoped that the portfolio would go to the extreme right-winger Rudolf Huliak, who has come to dubious notoriety for his hate-filled posts on social media targeting a Slovak nature conservationist whom he suggested should be hanged.
Because President Caputova vetoed Huliak's appointment to the post, 43-year-old Tomas Taraba was made environment minister instead.
While the new environment minister has not made any threatening remarks about conservationists, he has in the past accused NGOs of manipulating the ministry he now heads and made controversial statements about the protection of nature.
Many fear that Taraba, a successful businessman, will look after the interests of the industry and exploit rather than protect Slovakia's natural resources.

https://www.dw.com/en/gaza-arab-countries-unwilling-to-assume-control-in-the-future/a-67533773,POLITICS,Gaza: Arab countries unwilling to assume control in the future 23.11.2023,"Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi did not mince his words during the Manama Dialogue of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. 
""All of us have to speak loud and clear about the catastrophe that the Israeli war is bringing, not just on Gaza, but on the region in general,"" he said in Bahrain in mid-November.
Safadi's words highlight that even those Arab states that have diplomatically recognized Israel are currently distancing themselves from its military response to the Hamas terror attack on October 7. Hamas is classified as a terrorist organization in Germany, the European Union, the US and elsewhere.
The solidarity that Arabs feel for the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip — especially in view of the high and rising death toll — outweighs this far-reaching classification.
However, Arab states have also made it clear they are unwilling to play a part in establishing a new political order in the Gaza Strip after the end of the war, which is not yet foreseeable.
Arab states are not prepared to let Israel have its way and then ""come and clean the mess after Israel,"" stressed Safadi.
Representatives of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have expressed similar views.
One factor in their reluctance is the question of security, and whether Israel will really succeed in destroying Hamas and rendering it harmless.
Accepting political or even military responsibility in the Gaza Strip, where Hamas structures, or at least sympathy for the terrorist organization could possibly persist, would put Arab countries in an extremely delicate situation.
Jordan's foreign minister therefore does not see the responsibility for the Palestinian territory's political future with Jordan or other Arab nations. 
""Let me be very clear,"" said Ayman Safadi, ""there will be no Arab troops going to Gaza. None. We're not going to be seen as the enemy.""
""It is no coincidence that the Jordanian foreign minister is particularly vocal about his reservations,"" Nicolas Fromm, a political scientist at the Helmut Schmidt University in Hamburg, told DW. ""Jordan has had a peace treaty with Israel for a long time and the two countries have been working together in many ways for which the kingdom has been widely criticized in parts of the Arab world.""
Other Arab states, especially those in the Gulf, are likely to be in a similar situation. Some of them, such as the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, only concluded normalization agreements with Israel a few years ago. Others, such as Saudi Arabia, maintained good, albeit unofficial, relations with Israel until the beginning of 2023. They, too, are now likely to find themselves in hot water, as parts of the population are opposed to this course, Fromm said.
""The Palestinian question continues to play a major role in the Arab world and has great emotional and political mobilization potential,"" Eckart Woertz, director of the Hamburg-based GIGA Institute of Middle East Studies, told DW.
The public mood cannot be ignored by those in power, he added.
But at least some Gulf states are likely to have a rather ambivalent attitude towards Hamas, he said.
""After all, it is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is considered a terrorist organization in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Emirates,"" Woertz told DW.
Therefore, these countries' governments might be quietly pleased if Hamas was neutralized in the Gaza Strip, or at least restricted in its scope.
A further major challenge for the time after the war will be financial aid. Gaza, which has been blockaded by Israel and Egypt on and off for years, is unlikely to manage rebuilding its infrastructure on its own.
""But no one, neither Israel, nor America, nor the Arab states or Palestinian leaders, want to take responsibility,"" summarized the London-based business magazine The Economist after the meeting in Manama.
""They have already rebuilt Gaza several times,"" the article quotes an unnamed Western diplomat as saying. If the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip ""is not part of a serious peace process, they will not pay.""
Middle East expert Woertz considers a lasting political solution, specifically a two-state solution with East Jerusalem as capital of a Palestinian state, to be the minimum prerequisite for a possible subsequent Arab involvement in the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip.
""You can't just rebuild every few years and then destroy it again,"" he said. ""The European Union and the Gulf states probably have a similar view.""
According to the online magazine Al-Monitor, which focuses on the Middle East, the political elite of the Gulf states are also keen on keeping the conflict out of their own region. They are pinning their hopes on the war coming to an end at some point, Al-Monitor wrote.
However, this is by no means guaranteed. Iran-backed militias such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, pro-Iranian groups in Iraq, and the Houthi rebels in Yemen could escalate the conflict even further, as could Iran itself. Just a few days ago, for example, the Houthis captured a cargo ship in the Red Sea because of alleged links to Israel.
""The threat of an escalation of the conflict could conversely also be a motivation for some Arab countries to become more involved in finding a solution, for the sake of their own security,"" said Fromm, adding that no matter what a political solution would look like, it would have to focus not least on providing the Palestinians with an appropriate perspective.
""If that doesn't succeed, there will continue to be frustration, anger and therefore violence,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/sam-altman-returns-to-openai-what-does-it-mean/a-67532636,TECHNOLOGY,Sam Altman returns to OpenAI - what does it mean? 23.11.2023,"The saga unfolded over four days, encompassing the downfall of a technology leader and his return from the depths of defeat.
Last Friday, the board of directors of US artificial intelligence company OpenAI abruptly ousted the firm's CEO, Sam Altman. The decision set off a firestorm of debate, leading to a series of perplexing twists and turns. Then, late Tuesday night, OpenAI announced that Altman would return as CEO. The company also said it would revamp the board that ousted him.
The leadership crisis, though shrouded in speculation, has reverberated around the world — and it highlights the growing concentration of power in the hands of a few corporate leaders, said digital rights activist Fanny Hidvegi, Brussels-based director of European policy and advocacy at the nonprofit Access Now.
""This is just another story that shows us why we need to move away from this dependence on the infrastructure of a few tech companies,"" Hidvegi told DW.
Around the world, businesses and people are now using AI applications developed by companies like OpenAI. This has led to an increasing reliance on these technologies within entire industries.
""But we still don't have transparency into how these impactful technologies are made,"" Hidvegi said. ""And this whole OpenAI saga shows that a corporate governance structure, no matter how simple or complicated, will never provide the kind of accountability we need.""
Altman's ouster from OpenAI caught virtually everyone by surprise — including himself, judging by his social media reaction. But it was preceded by reports of growing strife within the company about the potential dangers of its technology.
To the public, OpenAI is best known for its ChatGPT chatbot and the large language models that underpin the application. But the company is also involved in other cutting-edge AI research, including into what's known as artificial general intelligence: Systems that could one day understand, learn, and apply their intelligence to any problem, much like humans do.
Against that backdrop, a group of scientists at the company consistently raised concerns about the unintended consequences of AI; risks they say Altman has not adequately addressed. 
This split illustrates an ongoing divide within the AI community: On one side are those, like Altman, who emphasize AI's vast potential to improve industries and society as a whole. On the other are those who warn of the risks of the technology's rapid development, which they say are being overlooked in the race to commercialize the technology.
Since Altman's ouster, there has been speculation that disagreement over such security concerns led, at least in part, to the board's decision.
Rasmus Rothe, the co-founder of Berlin-based AI investment firm Merantix, told DW that it's unclear ""to what extent this dispute was about core philosophical issues surrounding commercialization versus security, or whether it's more about egos and personal disagreements.""
""Perhaps it's a little bit of both,"" he added.
But he said that Altman's ouster and the way the company handled it sent shockwaves through the global AI community, which is connected through joint research and development projects as well as investments.
""It reflects poorly on our industry as a whole, which is still in its infancy and has many companies working hard to establish authority and trust,"" said the entrepreneur, who is also a board member of the German AI Association industry group. ""OpenAI should be a clear leader, but this whole episode has shown an astonishing degree of chaos and amateurism.""
Altman's return is also expected to have an impact on the ongoing global debate about what laws and regulations are needed for artificial intelligence.
In late October, the US issued an executive order outlining requirements for the most advanced AI technology; across the Atlantic, the European Union is finalizing the fine print of its AI Act, the most comprehensive set of legal rules specific to AI.
Few tech executives have been as visible and influential in the conversation about how to regulate AI as the well-spoken 38-year-old, who has traveled the world to meet with lawmakers from Washington, DC to Brussels.
""I hope that regulators will take this saga as proof that they need to listen more to civil society instead of these figureheads or tech visionaries,"" said Hidvegi, who was a member of an expert group set up by the EU in 2018 as a first step toward regulating AI.
And yet, Altman appears to be the winner of the curent leadership crisis. But he's not the only one, according to Hidvegi.
""Another winner is Microsoft,"" she said. The US tech giant has invested $13 billion in OpenAI since 2019 and now owns 49% of the company. After Altman's ouster, Microsoft offered to hire him. Now that he's returning to OpenAI, the corporation is reportedly pushing to have a representative on OpenAI's revamped board. 
""Once again, Big Tech comes out on top,"" Hidvegi said.

https://www.dw.com/en/happiest-ages-in-life/a-67511692,SCIENCE,When will I be happiest in my life? (Spoiler: not at 14) 23.11.2023,"Are you happy? And how old are you? Those two questions bundled together are the crux of a study conducted by a group of psychologists from Germany and Switzerland. DW’s Science Unscriptedpodcasters Conor Dillon and Gabriel Borrud spoke with lead author Susanne Bücker to get a sense of when humans – if you ask them in a survey at various points throughout their entire time on Earth - are most satisfied.
DW: Susanne, you looked at data from 460,000 people to find out what phase of life is best for human beings when it comes to subjective happiness. What did you find?
Susanne Bücker: We found that people seem to struggle during adolescence. Younger people from age nine to 14, for example, decrease in their life satisfaction. From age 14 onwards, however, and extending until 70 years of age, people increase in their subjective well-being and life satisfaction, slightly but steadily. And from 70 years until the end of life, life satisfaction decreases again.
And when you looked at those nine-year-olds, their happiness was decreasing – really?
Exactly. Their happiness decreased or their life satisfaction decreased, which is probably because this is a very busy time. Becoming an adolescent and being in puberty is a very intense time for young people. And there are also a lot of biological changes going on that affect their happiness - or how they feel about themselves.
So, we might be talking about something as simple as acne. And then you've got these new body odors coming out. You're not very happy with that. But your data suggests that from age 14 all the way to 70, life satisfaction remains either stable or increases slightly increases?
Yes, it's not a huge increase, but it stabilizes. And possibly because people also stabilize their romantic relationships during that time, or their financial situation stabilizes at least on average from young to middle adulthood. Many other mostly positive life events characterize this period. For example, starting your first job, but also moving in with your romantic partner or becoming a parent. So that's also something that can be negative, of course, but overall, people seem to be satisfied with their lives during that period.
And you found no swoons in the 20s or in the 30s or the 40s that would reflect anything along the lines of a midlife crisis?
No, we didn't, which was surprising, because there is other research suggesting such a midlife crisis. The problem with that research is that it's mainly cross-sectional, which means participants are asked only once about how happy they are. Significant data is accumulated from different people at different ages, and you see a U-shaped curve in middle ages, but it's not a longitudinal trajectory in terms of following the exact same people across multiple years. And this is what we have done in our study. And the longitudinal analysis shows that the U-shape is not the trajectory of subjective well-being.

I'm just having a tough time imagining that your data can be true. And this is infused by my own personal life experience. I’m thinking about the relatively hard early years of your career when you also must raise children. I am not going to say those were dark times, but those days were hard. You're waking up multiple times throughout the night. You're stressed, but you're trying to do good work. I would have thought my life satisfaction was down at that point. But your data suggests that somebody like me, if I were being surveyed throughout that time, my life satisfaction would have been the same as in my 20s or my 40s.
You are mentioning a very important point. One other line of my research studies major life events and changes in subjective well-being, but also feelings of loneliness surrounding such major life events like becoming a parent or marrying or getting divorced. And what people typically think is that these major life events must be very impactful for their subjective well-being or for their feelings of loneliness. But then when we look at such longitudinal data and - as you just said - ask people every year or every month how they feel, then they report a rather stable level of subjective well-being.
In retrospect, they still think that they must have changed during that time, that it must have been horrible for them. This is not reflected in how they fill out surveys, however. Maybe because society expects us to be happy when becoming a parent, for example. People don't want to admit that they might have some downsides in their lives during that period. And these retrospective assessments of how we feel might differ from what we see when we ask people directly after the major life event, or even multiple times surrounding such life events.

If you want to know more about subjective well-being at different ages (and why German people say that your 40s are better than your 30s), you can listen to this episode of Science Unscripted.

https://www.dw.com/en/irans-women-defend-themselves-against-state-violence/a-67529943,HUMAN RIGHTS,Iran's women defend themselves against state violence 23.11.2023,"The International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women is observed every year on November 25. Launched by feminist activists in 1981, the day draws attention to the various forms of violence that women face.
In Iran, little is said officially about this day. When Iranian media takes up the topic of ""violence against women,"" the focus is usually placed on violence against women in Western countries, where people supposedly live without the protection of religion.
They refer to statistics that ostensibly indicate a much higher level of violence against women than in Iran.
However, statistics on violence against women in Iran are difficult to find and are often incomplete. Many forms of violence against women in Iran are not even recorded, for example, the forms of violence experienced daily by women at the hands of the Iranian state.
""The greatest danger for women in Iran comes from the state,"" Iranian legal and religious scholar Sedigheh Vasmaghi told DW.
The 62-year-old lawyer from Tehran is one of the most prominent critics of the Islamic Republic. For many years, she was the only woman to teach at the Faculty of Theology at Tehran University. Her critical attiude is a thorn in the side of those in power in Tehran.

Vasmaghi particularly criticizes regulations that are based on a strict interpretation of Sharia law. ""These laws legitimize the use of violence against women and thus give it a legal basis,"" she said.
The lawyer cites an example of this in a new draft law on compulsory headscarves, along with all other strict measures regarding a dress code for women, ""which are enforced with naked violence on a large scale in public.""
Vasmaghi, who lived in Germany between 2011 and 2017, and worked as a visiting professor at the University of Göttingen, wrote an open letter to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ali Khamenei, in April 2023.
In the letter, she questions the hijab from a theological perspective. According to her, the Islamic Republic's hijab laws have no basis in the Quran.
Punishing women who break these rules, Vasmaghi warned, has social, political and psychological consequences. Such punishments have violated the dignity of women and exacerbated social polarization.
At the end of September, Iran's Parliament passed a controversial dress code reform for women, which stipulates drastic penalties for violations, especially of the headscarf requirement.
Repeated violations could even result in prison sentences of up to 15 years. In addition, the publication of photos of women without headscarves on the internet is punishable, for example, by being barred from leaving the country. The judiciary has threatened to close shopping malls, restaurants and museums if violations are found.
For many women who are tired of conforming and constantly wearing the headscarf, this means they live their daily lives in constant fear of being attacked or even beaten to death.
Since the tragic death of 22-year-old Jina Mahsa Amini in police custody in September 2022, and the subsequent nationwide protests, many women have nevertheless refused to wear the headscarf in public.

Hossein Jalali, a member of the parliamentary culture committee, has said the headscarf represents the ""flag of the Islamic Republic"" for women. This symbolizes the state's discrimination against women, which is also reflected in laws and jurisdiction, inheritance law, contract law, freedom of travel and much more.
""In Iran, violence against women is a continuum,"" Iranian sociologist Azadeh Kian told DW. Kian lives in Paris and is director of the Center for Gender and Feminist Studies at the University of Paris.
Kian has studied the women's movement in Iran for a long time. ""State violence in public is continued in domestic violence,"" said Kian. ""If a woman in Germany or France is a victim of violence at home, she turns to the police. In Iran, the police use violence against women,"" she added.
In confidential conversations with DW, Iranian women who have appeared in public without their headscarves spoke about the stress they are exposed to.
A 50-year-old woman from the capital Tehran described her experience when she was caught on camera without a headscarf.
""I dropped my headscarf in my car. The surveillance cameras caught me, and my car was confiscated. But the worst thing was how rudely the vice squad spoke to me and allowed themselves to shout at me,"" referring to the Guidance Patrol or ""morality police"" which enforces Sharia-Islamic law in Iran.
Other women spoke of similar experiences, emphasizing that the ""morality police"" often turn up unexpectedly and try to intimidate women with violence and brutality.
""This violence will not intimidate women,"" says Iranian legal and religious scholar Vasmaghi.
""As a member of this society, I am observing a profound change. Belief in the hijab and the headscarf is dwindling even among many religious people, both women and men. I see more and more religious women who no longer wear the headscarf in their own circles and are supported by their husbands,"" she added.

Sociologist Kian also sees signs of change in Iranian society. ""When women experience violence on the street, sometimes men now step in front of them and protect them.""
She finds it remarkable that these changes can be seen not only happening in the traditionally more liberal capital Tehran, but also throughout the country.
There are now also restaurant and store owners who would rather close their businesses than implement the ban on serving unveiled women.
""These men and women are part of a resistance that is creating women's rights not in the law, but in the public sphere.""

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-public-sector-strikes-hit-schools-and-hospitals/a-67526239,POLITICS,Germany: Public sector strikes hit schools and hospitals 23.11.2023,"Thousands of public sector employees across Germany went on strike Wednesday, closing schools, daycare centers and administrative offices in the city states of Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg.
Trade unions said that over 10,000 employees struck in Berlin alone, where many marched to the city's famous Brandenburg Gate calling for better pay and working conditions.
Teachers, daycare workers, police, firefighters and state administrators were among those involved in the walkout.
""It is very clear that our colleagues expect something, because otherwise they will no longer be able to live in the city where they work,"" a spokesperson for the Verdi trade union said in Berlin.
Two rounds of collective bargaining negotiations between public sector employees and Germany's states have so far failed to produce a breakthrough.
""The federal states have not presented an offer in two rounds of nationwide negotiations,"" said Verdi's regional director for Berlin-Brandenburg, Andrea Kühnemann. ""This is very disrespectful toward employees.""
Employees at hospitals in the states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein on Wednesday announced that they will begin a two-day warning strike on Thursday and Friday.
The move will affect hospitals as well as psychiatric wards across the states as demonstrations are scheduled throughout Thursday.
Unions are demanding a 10.5% pay increase as well as city-state bonuses of €300 ($326) in Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg.
The next round of bargaining negotiations is set to take place on December 7 and 8.
Pharmacists in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg also stopped work Wednesday, not over collective bargaining, but to protest changes to German healthcare laws that would force pharmacists to cover discounts provided to statutory health insurance funds, cutting into business profits.

https://www.dw.com/en/georgia-the-thorns-of-the-rose-revolution/a-67536678,POLITICS,Georgia: The thorns of the Rose Revolution 22.11.2023,"In 2003, the Rose Revolution laid the foundations for a democratic regime in Georgia, which made an emphatic turn towards the West.
Today, according to a survey by the US nonprofit International Republican Institute (IRA), an overwhelming majority of the population of the former Soviet republic is in support of Georgia acceding to the European Union.
In November 2003, hundreds of thousands of Georgians took to the streets to demand democracy and reforms. The term ""Rose Revolution"" derives from a quote by the first Georgian president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia (1939 – 1993), who once said: ""Instead of bullets, we will throw roses at our enemies.""
The coup took place in the Georgian capital Tbilisi without a drop of blood. On November 22, 2022, demonstrators broke into the parliament and the state chancellery. The next day, President Eduard Shevardnadze announced his resignation.
Political scientist George Mchedlishvili from the European University in Tbilisi, who was about 30 at the time, attended the protests, albeit not every day. ""I was very excited and very hopeful,"" he told DW. ""I sympathized with the protesters, sympathized with the prevailing mood."" He explained that the overriding sentiment was that the government had ""had its day"" and ""should go."" He said that almost the entire nation was ready for reform: ""That's why it was successful, and that's why it happened to be bloodless.""
Another demonstrator ""armed"" with roses was Mikheil Saakashvili, the founder and leader of the center-right United National Movement party. In January 2004, he won over 96% of the votes in the presidential elections. After taking office, he tried to transform the country into a democracy that would set an example for other former Soviet states.
The new government ""managed in the first few years to make Georgia into a functioning state because public institutions were extremely inefficient,"" Mchedlishvili said.
The reforms were supposed to liberalize the economy, reduce bureaucracy, and promote an orientation towards the West. At first, there was apparent success. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index published by Transparency International and others, corruption decreased. The economy also grew rapidly, ranking 112th place in 2006 in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business index and 7th place in 2020.
But criticism of Saakashvili's authoritarian style of governance began to grow, and mass protests calling for the president's resignation broke out just four years after the Rose Revolution. They were less peaceful than in 2003 and Saakashvili used violence to disperse them. He stepped down on November 25, 2007 to allow for early presidential elections.
However, his absence was short-lived and on January 5, 2008, he won the election with 53% of the vote. But his popularity continued to decline as his reforms faltered.
The United National Movement lost its majority in the 2012 parliamentary elections. And after two terms in office, Saakashvili was not allowed to run in the 2013 presidential election.
An investigation was opened into abuse of power and the former revolutionary hero went into exile. He returned to Georgia in 2021 when he was arrested and jailed.
Saakashvili's legacy and the Rose Revolution remain contested today. One part of the population sees ""Misha"" affectionately as a reformer who fought against corruption and afforded new opportunities to the younger generation.
But the current ruling party Georgian Dream – Democratic Georgia, is at odds with Saakashvili's United National Movement, which remains the country's biggest opposition party, and regards the Rose Revolution as a negative chapter in the country's history. It has not supported the West's sanctions against Russia after the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Tornike Sharashenidze, from the Georgian Institute of Public Affairs, pointed out that among the Georgian population the perception of the Rose Revolution was generally positive. He predicted that if Saakashvili gave up politics, the ""perception of his legacy will be better in 20 or 30 years."" He explained that Saakashvili remained the driving force behind the United National Movement despite his imprisonment.

Mchedlishvili said that ""new political blood"" that would act in the interests of Georgia was now ""badly needed."" He said that the Rose Revolution would ""go down in history"" as a case when a ""new leadership riding on the crest of popular support"" as able to change a ""corrupt regime."" But he added that ""lasting changes are impossible without people."" 
On multiple occasions, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for the release of Saakashvili, who also holds Ukrainian citizenship. In April 2020, he even offered him the position of deputy prime minister.

https://www.dw.com/en/why-the-eu-canada-trade-deal-is-a-big-deal/a-67514960,BUSINESS,Why the EU-Canada trade deal is a big deal 22.11.2023,"The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) is a free-trade deal between Canada and the EU. 
CETA was negotiated between 2009 and 2014 and signed by Canadian Prime Minister  Justin Trudeau, in Brussels on 30 October 2016, before the European Parliament approved the deal in February 2017.
Much of it has been provisionally applied since then.
The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will be in Canada for the EU-Canada Summit on November 23-24.
In a statement they said they will highlight ""CETA's positive results on trade and investment and tangible outcomes of the EU-Canada Strategic Partnership on Critical Raw materials.""

As of December 2022, 17 member states had completed domestic ratification: Austria, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden. Italy, Ireland and Belgium have been laggards, with France also dragging its feet.
The deal eliminates or reduces tariffs on imported goods between the two parties.
The EU has eliminated 97.7% of tariffs on Canadian goods, with a goal of 98.7% this year. In Canada, 98.2% of all tariffs on EU goods have been eliminated and it's targeting 98.6% this year.
CETA mutually recognizes regulated professions such as architects, accountants and engineers. 
The agreement also imposes stricter enforcement of intellectual property, including liability for internet service providers, and a ban on technology that can circumvent copyright. 
Both the EU and Canada retain the right to regulate freely in areas of public interest such as environmental protection and health and safety.
The European Commission estimates the treaty will eventually lead to savings of €500 million ($545 million) in taxes for EU exporters annually.
It says CETA will further boost trade between the EU and Canada, create new jobs, enable speedier business operations by abolishing goods checks and other levies, make easier mutual recognition of diplomas and regulate investment disputes by creating a new system of courts.
The Commission also claims CETA will create a more level playing field between Canada and the EU on intellectual property rights.
Opponents say CETA weakens European consumer rights, including EU standards concerning food safety. Some see it as a benefit mainly for big business and multinational corporations. 
The deal includes a controversial investor-state dispute settlement mechanism that critics say multinationals may use to sue national governments. Such investment courts are run by corporate lawyers and have not been models of transparency and accountability, critics add. 
There are also concerns that CETA sidelines the European Parliament and gives more power to governments and bureaucrats. Critics say it benefits lobbyists, as all its committees work in secret.
With 500 million people, the EU is the world's largest (according to the UN) or second largest (according to the World Bank and IMF) economy. Canada, with a population of 36 million, has the world's 10th largest GDP. 
The EU is Canada's second largest trading partner in goods and services. Canada and the EU engage in $67 billion-worth (€63.5 billion) in trade annually.
According to Statistics Canada, the EU is also the second largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Canada. According to Eurostat, the EU identified Canada as its third largest destination and its fourth largest source of FDI.
In 2020, Canadian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) exported $8 billion in goods to the EU, a 24% increase since CETA's provisional application in 2017. Bilateral trade in 2020 was 12.5% higher than it was pre-CETA in 2016.
A poll by Angus Reid Institute in February 2017 found that 55% of Canadians support CETA, while only 10% opposed it. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the US and Mexico had a 44% support rate among Canadians, according to the pollster.
In some parts of Europe, most vociferously in Ireland, CETA is widely seen as a threat to national sovereignty at best and at worst a bridgehead for US multinationals to move into Irish markets.

https://www.dw.com/en/india-resumes-e-visa-services-for-canadians-amid-row/a-67524647,POLITICS,India resumes e-visa services for Canadians amid row 22.11.2023,"India restored electronic visa services for Canadian nationals on Wednesday, the Indian High Commission in Ottawa said.
“Indian eVisa facility has been restored with effect from 22 November 2023, for all eligible Canadian citizens,” the Indian High Commission in Ottawa wrote on X.
Last month, India resumed services for entry, business, medical and conference visas for Canadian nationals. But tourist visas for Canadian are yet to be restored.
India suspended visa services in Canada afterCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged in September that his government was probing ""credible allegations"" tying Indian agents to the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar.
Nijjar, a dual Canadian citizen, was a prominent organizer in the Sikh community in Canada and a proponent of the separatist Khalistan Movement.
The Sikh separatist leader, whom India claimed had links to terrorism, was gunned down outside a Sikh temple in June. 
The restoration of e-visa services is being seen as a major de-escalatory move by India after relations between the countries took a nosedive following the allegation.
As tensions escalated, Delhi asked Ottawa to reduce its diplomatic presence in India, with Canada ultimately withdrawing 41 diplomats and their families from the country.
Canada stopped consular services in India and said visas could only be processed at the Canadian High Commission in Delhi.
New Delhi worries about Sikh separatist groups in Canada that have long strained ties between the two countries. It has accused Canada of harboring separatists and ""terrorists.""
India's government has outlawed the Khalistan Movement as a security threat. There have been periodic episodes of violence related to the movement over decades in India.

https://www.dw.com/en/uk-conservatives-issue-tax-cuts-as-election-looms/a-67522449,POLITICS,UK: Conservatives issue tax cuts as election looms 22.11.2023,"Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer (or finance minister) Jeremy Hunt on Wednesday announced a larger than expected cut in social security contributions and said new business incentives would be made permanent in a bid to accelerate sluggish economic growth. 
Hunt, who is seeking to boost the fortunes of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party ahead of a probable election next year, also said welfare payments and the state pension would be increased. 
Nevertheless, he told the House of the Commons parliament that the government was still set to meet its public finance targets, and said the country's fiscal watchdog concurred on this point. 
""After a global pandemic and energy crisis, we have taken difficult decisions to put our economy back on track,"" Hunt said. ""Rather than a recession, the economy has grown. Rather than falling as predicted, real incomes have risen. Our plan for the British economy is working. But the work is not done."" 
Hunt also said the UK's economy was now forecast to grow by 0.6% this year, rather than shrink by 0.2% as previously predicted. However, predictions for 2024 economic performance were simultaneously revised downwards, to 0.7% growth from a previous estimate of 1.8%.
Hunt said he was cutting the rate of national insurance — a form of social security — paid by employees by 2% to 10%, as well as a smaller cut for self-employed workers.
The main change in business taxation will affect a tax break known as ""full expensing."" 
This is a capital allowance scheme that allows companies to deduct the costs of necessary plant and machinery from their taxable profits. It's designed to encourage and boost new business investment in the country, which has flatlined since the 2016 vote to leave the EU, even as it increased in other G7 countries over the same period.
Hunt said that it cost the British government in the region of 11 billion pounds (roughly €12.6 billion or $13.7 billion) a year, and was due to expire in 2026, but said it could now be made permanent thanks to improved public finances. 
Jeremy Hunt and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak both came into their roles last year, having to overturn and undo the raft of proposed tax cuts and economic reforms that swiftly turned Sunak's predecessor Liz Truss into Britain's shortest-serving prime minster. 
Truss announced sweeping changes, including abolishing the country's top rate of tax for the highest earners, without submitting them for analysis by the Office for Budgetary Responsibility (OBR) — the country's fiscal watchdog that did screen Hunt's announcements on Wednesday. 
Amid a cocktail of post-Brexit malaise, the aftereffects of the COVID pandemic, and spiking inflation and energy costs caused in large part by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the move spooked investors who began to flee from their British holdings. 
This forced Truss first to U-turn and appoint Hunt as a new finance minister to undo her work, and then to resign altogether after trying to cling on a little longer. 
Sunak, himself a former finance minister, then emerged as the next prime minister — the fourth Conservative leader in as many years.
He and Hunt had since sought to portray themselves as more fiscally responsible, in favor of tax cuts in principle but only willing to deliver them after steadying the ship following several difficult years for the global economy in general and Britain's in particular. 
Now, with elections probable next year and the Conservatives trailing the opposition Labour Party by as much as 20% in some polls, the government is seeking to show its fiscal policies are turning a corner. 
Sunak and Hunt, considered more centrist Conservatives, might also have felt pressure to try to mend fences with the right flank of the Conservative Party since last week's sacking of former Home Secretary (or interior minister) Suella Braverman. 

The low-tax wing of the Tory Party was, including Truss herself, was out in force on Wednesday both welcoming the cuts, and calling for more.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-nigerian-business-forum-seeks-to-woo-investors/a-67515112,BUSINESS,German-Nigerian Business Forum seeks to woo investors 22.11.2023,"This year's German-Nigerian Business summit saw scores of high-profile speakers, including Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, extol Nigeria's economic potentials.
President Tinubu, who gave a keynote talk opening the summit, was keen to boost confidence in his nation, stressing that Nigeria had transformed into a reliable business partner. 
While conceding that ""it could be difficult in past to do business in Nigeria,"" Tinubu said ""I want to appeal to you: forget the past.""
""Any [investment] obstacle that you've experienced in the past, believe it, it's gone,"" the leader added. 
Tinubu made a point of highlighting his move to scrap the country's fuel subsidy after taking office in May — a costly scheme that has been linked to corruption. The president concluded by expressly welcoming investment in his country, saying ""I'm looking forward to having you in Nigeria, investing more and getting the highest return on your investments.""
Nigeria boasts the largest economy on the African continent. Last year, its GDP totaled just over $477 billion (€437 billion).
It is thought to possess about 37 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves and is Africa’s biggest oil exporter. Additionally, Nigeria holds an estimated 206.5 trillion cubic feet (5.91 trillion cubic meters) of proven natural gas reserves.
Just this week, Germany struck a deal to begin importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Nigeria. Germany, after all, has scrambled to find new suppliers after weaning itself off Russian gas. 
Yet despite this promising news, so far, German companies remain hesitant about doing business in Nigeria. 
In 2021, direct German investment in Nigeria amounted to just $158 million.   
German companies still have concerns about corruption and political instability in the West African nation, concerns that Nigeria's Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment Doris Uzoka-Anite was eager to dispel. 
In a bid to underscore Nigeria's credentials, Uzoka-Anite told conference attendees that her country was now in its ""third decade of peaceful transition of democratic rule, premised on an unwavering commitment to our constitution and the sanctity of the rule of law.""
She also said Nigeria offers a multitude of investment opportunities including in pharmaceuticals, medical technologies, automotive development, infrastructure, the green economy, technology, mining and energy. As a result, she said, Nigeria had now positioned itself as an ""investor's dream.""
On the sidelines of the summit, Debra Egerue of the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce in Nigeria told DW she thought Nigeria's ""business environment is really changing.""
""We have a new president and a new team, and from what we have seen, the president is focusing on a lot of reforms,"" she said.

In a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by Nigeria's Riverside LNG project, which works in the country's Niger Delta, and Germany's Johannes Schuetze Energy Import, Nigeria will export 850,000 tons of liquified natural gas (LNG) per year to Germany, increasing in the future to 1.2 million tons.
The first deliveries, which will represent 2% of Germany's total LNG imports, are expected to leave Nigeria in 2026.
""This is a further step towards diversifying German gas imports,"" said Johannes Schuetze, chairman of the German gas importer, of the historic first ever gas deal between Africa's most populous country and Europe's biggest gas consumer, signed at the G20 Compact with Africa conference in Berlin.
In return, a second MOU was signed in which Germany committed a further $500 million of investment into renewable energy and technology projects in Nigeria, aiming especially at bringing more people into the formal economy.
Germany is also discussing an agreement with electronics giant Siemens to help with Nigeria's electric power supply, which is unstable and a major burden for Nigerians and businesses.

https://www.dw.com/en/g20-led-africa-summit-stresses-colossal-investment-need/a-67510775,POLITICS,G20-led Africa summit stresses 'colossal' investment need 21.11.2023,"The need for internal investment among African nations is ""colossal,"" according to African Union (AU) Chair Azali Assoumani.
Speaking at the G20 Compact with Africa (CwA) summit in Berlin on November 20, Assoumani said that while investment in African nations from G20 countries is inching above pre-pandemic levels, it still falls ""far short"" of the record amount of almost $53 billion (€48.4 billion) reached in the 2017-2018 fiscal year.
Aiming to spark greater private investment in Africa, the CwA initiative brings 13 African members together with representatives from the G20 major economies, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the African Development Bank.

Jean-Michel Sama Lukonde, the Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, said his country was ""greatly satisfied"" to be accepted as the initiative's 13th member.
CwA members need to demonstrate willingness to undertake the reforms necessary to attract investment, something that DR Congo has ""clearly showed,"" Lukonde told DW at the summit.
""This membership, in fact, marks a kind of recognition of all these efforts that [DR Congo] is making,"" he said.
""Now we're calling for investment.""
Other leaders' comments at the summit illustrated the appetite of Africans to diversify their relationships and their trading partners, including with Germany.
Assoumani, who is president of the Comoros and holds the rotating AU chair, used the summit to defend Africa's embrace of investment from China and call for more ""positive competition"" from Europe.
""There is no monopoly anywhere. ... Everyone has a place,"" he said on Monday.
Highlighting to the continent's ""vast potential,"" African Union Commission Chair Moussa Faki Mahamat said investors stand to benefit from Africa's young population and considerable natural resources.
Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu, Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Senegal's President Macky Sall were among the 18 African leaders who traveled to Berlin for the summit, where around 800 companies were represented.
Underscoring renewed interest in Africa, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and French President Emmanuel Macron, as well as numerous ministers, attended the summit, hosted by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
The event, with high-ranking politicians and business representatives, ""demonstrates a certain amount of progress,"" said Africa economist Robert Kappel, adding that he hoped it would mark a ""new beginning of stronger Africa relations.""
""Now we just have to see if more investment flows from G20 countries and from Germany, and if the promises will be realized,"" he told DW. ""But I still have doubts as to whether this will really happen so quickly and whether there will really be a breakthrough.""
Launched in 2017, during Germany's G20 presidency, the CwA has been running for six years now.
""The results are hotly debated,"" said Alex Vines, the Africa Program director at Chatham House, a London-based policy institute, adding that it's unclear if initiative members are experiencing more growth.
African countries have long complained that while European nations talk a great deal about investment, their companies are slow to put money into Africa — despite a number of countries such as Ghana, Senegal and Rwanda significantly improving the conditions of doing business over the past several years.
Germany, Europe's biggest economy, lags behind when it comes to investment in Africa. Between 2016 and 2020, €9.7 billion in direct foreign investment flowed from Germany to Africa.
""That's tiny compared to other European countries,"" Vines told DW, with Germany spending only half as much as France and three-fifths as much as the UK.
Only 1% of the €163.7 billion that German companies invested in foreign countries in 2022 was spent in Africa. More than half of that direct foreign investment went to South Africa, where around 400 German companies operate.
In contrast, only 30 German companies operate in Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy.
""German companies created just 30,000 new jobs in the last 10 years in Africa. That is 3,000 jobs per year, which is very, very little,"" said economist Kappel.
He believes Africa offers numerous investment possibilities for European firms beyond natural resources, such as in the industrial and food sectors, agriculture, tourism and the service industry.
At the summit, German Chancellor Scholz pledged to invest €4 billion ($4.4 billion) in green energy projects in Africa by 2030, adding that Germany will import ""a large proportion"" of its green hydrogen needs from the continent.
""Hydrogen production requires considerable investment at the start, so clear signals for a long-term and durable cooperation are needed,"" Scholz said. ""The Compact with Africa conference aims to send the signal: You can count on Germany as a partner.""
Geopolitical expert Ovigwe Eguegu sees Scholz as being ""very committed"" to building a better working relationship with Africa. Scholz recently made his third trip to the continent since becoming German chancellor nearly two years ago.

""He has put his boots on the ground, as it were, and is really engaging directly in high-level diplomacy,"" Eguegu told DW.
African nations, he said, want to attract more value-added projects but German and other European nations often fail to prioritize them.
""It's still the same old model of you come with a couple of billion euro and then you invest in extractives. But the continent's priority at this point is to move beyond that,"" said Eguegu, a policy analyst at Development Reimagined consultancy.
""The Compact with Africa also has to be based on the priorities of Africa, not just the priorities of one side.""

https://www.dw.com/en/how-will-israel-hamas-conflict-impact-cop28-climate-summit/a-67502075,CONFLICTS,How will Israel-Hamas conflict impact COP28 climate summit? 21.11.2023,"Last year, the much-praised eco-power project shared by former foes Jordan and Israel was touted as an example of how environmentally friendly policies could bring about a better future in the Middle East.
Visiting the region, Germany's own economy minister, Robert Habeck, praised what was known as the ""water-for-energy"" project. He said that if it worked out as planned, it would be a positive example of how Arab states were cooperating with Israel and that it would ""build trust and be an impulse for cooperation instead of confrontation."" 
But as of last week, hope for the project — which was supposed to see Jordan provide Israel with solar energy and Israel send Jordan desalinated water in exchange — seems all but lost.
The tentative deal was agreed in November last year and the final version was to be signed at this year's climate conference, COP28, in the United Arab Emirates, set to take place from November 30 to December 12.
But as Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said during a TV interview on Al Jazeera last Thursday, ""We will not sign this agreement any longer. Can you imagine a Jordanian minister sitting next to an Israeli minister to sign a water and electricity agreement, all while Israel continues to kill children in Gaza?""
This may only be one example of collateral damage to COP28 caused by the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict.
COP28 is considered one of the world's most important international conferences on climate change because it brings together all the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. COP is short for ""conference of the parties"" to the convention — there are 198, and they include all UN member states as well as the European Union — and it occurs annually. This is the 28th edition, and it's taking place in Dubai, in the UAE.
But as the fate of the Israeli-Jordanian deal shows, negotiators attending COP28 will likely have to deal with at least some repercussions from the current conflict.
""International climate politics and climate action do not happen in a vacuum,"" said Ruth Townend, a research fellow at the UK-based think tank Chatham House, whose focus is climate risk and diplomacy. ""Governments' positions are shaped by the broader geopolitical context, which constrains or enables effective action and influence,"" she told DW.
Observers suggest there are a number of ways the Israel-Hamas conflict, ongoing since an October 7 attack by the Hamas militant group, might impact COP28 negotiations, in both concrete and more ephemeral ways.
This year's summit is expected to be the biggest one yet, and safety could be a concern for some of the around 70,000 delegates expected in Dubai amid the heated emotions the conflict is causing in the Middle East.
The UAE, a monarchy that, according to rights groups like Amnesty International, doesn't allow unauthorized or anti-government protests, has not seen the same kinds of violent, anti-Israel protests as other nations in the region. Nor have any countries issued travel advisories or warnings about going to Dubai.
Nonetheless, some countries and international companies have expressed concern. Earlier in November, Swiss bank UBS warned staff against business travel to the Middle East.
Israel had planned to send around 1,000 delegates to Dubai. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had also been invited to attend and was expected in Dubai in early December. Some reports now say that the delegation will be reduced.
DW asked Israel's Environment Ministry whether the country still planned to send as many delegates and senior politicians to COP28, but the ministry did not respond before publication.
There may well be protests during the summit, too. The UAE has said it will allow environmentally-focused protests and these ""will likely raise the plight of Gaza, drawing attention to how an escalating Israeli invasion, with its attendant destruction of water infrastructure and services and massive displacement, will have catastrophic and generational effects on Palestinians' already severe vulnerability to climate change,"" Frederic Wehrey, a senior fellow in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote in mid-October. 
Financing for climate initiatives could also be affected, experts said. If the conflict continues or spreads, it will have a negative impact on the world economy, the International Monetary Fund has warned, which would influence how much money is available to fight climate change and how richer — and more polluting — nations feel about financial compensation to poorer, less developed countries.
Another less tangible impact may be reflected in the attitudes of different countries when it comes to agreeing to deals on environmental protection. It has been suggested that some of the senior diplomats who usually prepare for talks at COP28 — which is often when deals are finalized rather than technical details debated — will have been distracted by the conflict.
It's also possible that diplomats from certain countries may now be less willing to compromise with others because they stand on different sides of the conflict.
""Because of the Western world's stance in this conflict, they [Western nations] now have to show that they are interested in multilateral development and the global fight against climate change,"" Federico Tassan-Viol, a senior policy adviser for diplomacy at Italian climate change think tank Ecco, told DW. ""They must show they believe in multilateralism in their foreign policy choices.""
""In fact,"" he continued, ""this could even be an opportunity for closer cooperation, to show they mean business when it comes to climate change. These negotiations could be a means to achieve peace and security.""
Despite the list of potential impacts, most observers believe that the host, the UAE, will do its best to partition COP28 from the conflict in Gaza.
Each day at COP28 is themed with a certain topic, and December 3 focuses on ""Health/Relief, Recover, and Peace.""
That day, ""some countries will likely be more vocal about justice or freedom,"" said Tassan-Viol. But that shouldn't make a huge difference to the final agenda of COP28, he added, referring to the fact that negotiations on technical details of agreements began long before COP28 and also continue afterward.
""From a technical point of view, I think in many ways, the preparatory works have given a clear direction and the path has already been set,"" he said. ""The UN's climate change body is not the UN Security Council. So from that point of view, I don't think they [delegates] will be blinded by the polarization on the international level about the Gaza conflict.""
Chatham House's Townend hopes concerns over a warming planet will overcome any polarization at COP28.
""As climate impacts increase, we are unfortunately likely to see increasing disasters, tensions and conflicts over strained resources,"" she pointed out. ""Governments and policymakers will need to find ways to cooperate and compromise to address climate risks that ... cannot be put on hold while current crises, however tragic and however pressing, are tackled.""

https://www.dw.com/en/will-germany-invest-in-thailands-land-bridge-project/a-67509485,TRADE,Will Germany invest in Thailand's 'land bridge' project? 21.11.2023,"Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, the country's self-styled chief ""salesman,"" has been shuttling between major capitals and in and out of meetings with ambassadors since he entered office in August. All to sell the idea of a vast ""land bridge"" connecting Thailand's eastern and western coasts.
The project is designed to provide a new trade route between the Indian and Pacific oceans, bypassing the Malacca Strait, one of the world's most vital and congested sea corridors.
It involves the construction of an about 90-kilometer-long (56-mile-long) rail and road system that will connect the deep-sea port in Chumphon Province on the Gulf of Thailand to a new, deep-water port in Ranong province on the Andaman Sea.
Srettha, who is also finance minister, touted the grand vision to Chinese investors when he attended the latest Belt and Road Forum in China in mid-October before pitching the €25.5 billion ($28 billion) megaproject to Middle Eastern investors a few weeks later.
He took the idea to San Francisco on November 12 when he attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, where he spoke to American businesses during his ""Thailand Land Bridge Roadshow.""
The Thai government is open to anyone who wants to invest in what some analysts call a ""pipe dream"" that has been imagined by Thai leaders since as far back as the 17th century.
Ernst Wolfgang Reichel, the new German ambassador to Bangkok, apparently told Thai government officials earlier this month that he would lobby German businesses to invest in the project.
""The German side was clearly interested in the land bridge project. And [the ambassador] will report back to the German government about the project, which he believes will appeal to many investors,"" Thai Transport Minister Suriya Jungrungreangkit said this month, according to local media. 
Ambassador Reichel reportedly also asked the Thai government to bring its Thailand Land Bridge Roadshow to Germany next year.
Whether German companies, such as Siemens, which has helped build parts of Bangkok's rail system, would be interested in investing in such a scheme, remains to be seen.

Most analysts reckon the bulk of the funding will come from China, the largest investor in Southeast Asian infrastructure projects.
But the new Thai government, which took office in August after nearly a decade of military rule, has said it wants to diversify its investment links. Analysts say Bangkok wants to closely balance the country's economy between China and the West.
Supposing that funding comes through and construction starts on time, the project will be finished by around 2040, at which point both ports will have the capacity to handle approximately 20 million cargo containers annually, according to Thailand's Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning, which manages the project.
The idea dates back to the 17th century, when the Ayutthaya kingdom was a prosperous entrepot and modernizers foresaw that a vast canal, dubbed the ""Kra Canal,"" would connect the eastern and western coasts and boost trade.
The canal idea was resurrected on several occasions during the 19th and 20th centuries, although the scale and cost of the project was too great.
In the 21st century, Thai governments have leaned more towards a cheaper and more sustainable ""land bridge” alternative, connecting the two coasts via railways and motorways, not a canal.
In 2020, Thailand's former military-run government resurrected the land bridge project and set up legislative and ministerial commissions to study its feasibility, which delivered their findings a few months ago.  
The land bridge would be coupled with Thailand's vast Eastern Economic Corridor scheme, which aims to transform three nearby eastern provinces into hubs for manufacturing, research and services. It would also be connected to the new China-Laos-Thailand high-speed railway, as well as to railways China is building in neighboring Cambodia.
According to the Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning, ministers will report back to Cabinet on their discussions with international investors next year, and the bidding process will take place between April and June 2025.
As of 2020, 227 German companies had invested around €4.2 billion in Thailand, the largest German foreign investment in a Southeast Asian country other than Singapore and Malaysia, according to estimates by the Deutsche Bundesbank.
Mercedes-Benz and BMW, German automobile giants, have invested in manufacturing projects within the Eastern Economic Corridor scheme, while Siemens has invested in several transport infrastructure projects in the country.
According to a German diplomatic source, who asked not to be named as they were not permitted to speak about the matter, if German companies were to invest in the scheme, they would most likely focus on developing the ports.
But they added that any German participation would likely be ""limited.""
China, meanwhile, is the largest foreign investor in infrastructure projects in the region and it is building a pan-Asian railway network throughout mainland Southeast Asia as an alternative route to sea lanes passing through the Malacca Strait.
Thai-based Gulf Energy Development and the Chinese state-owned China Harbor Engineering Company are currently redeveloping Thailand's largest port at Laem Chabang.
Chinese firms would not benefit from a joint partnership with German companies and would only need a local Thai government partner, said Antonio Rappa, associate professor and head of Management and Security Studies at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.
Although German companies have invested in Thailand, their focus has been in IT and retail or manufacturing, not construction, he pointed out.
""So, it would not be wise for German companies to invest in that mega project even if they possess the technological know-how,” he added. ""The Germans are likely to play a marginal role, if any.”
The German embassy in Bangkok did not respond to requests for comment.
Mark Cogan, an expert on Thailand at Japan's Kansai Gaidai University, said another major stumbling block for European investors could be the environmental and social implications of the project, which haven't been fully assessed.

There have been several protests in the areas where the project will be located since Srettha said his government is committed to the scheme, as it could require the relocation of several thousand people. There are also concerns about the impact on the tourism and fishing industries in southern provinces.
""The immediate challenge for Srettha is to prove that the land bridge will not only be profitable, but it won't amplify carbon emissions in the process,” Cogan said. 
There are also geopolitical risks. US officials have warned that Chinese engagement in the Southern Economic Corridor scheme could be a way for Beijing to gain control of Thailand's critical infrastructure, especially its ports. 
Bangkok is clearly determined not to solely rely on Chinese money for this scheme, the analysts say, which could make it an ideal project for investment from the EU's Global Gateway Initiative, an infrastructure funder, or private European companies.
Meanwhile, the EU and Thailand agreed to relaunch talks for a free trade agreement in March. The new Thai government appears keen to boost relations with European states. Discussions are also ongoing over whether to offer European visitors an extended visa-free stay of up to 90 days in Thailand.

https://www.dw.com/en/in-africa-demands-for-slavery-reparations-grow-louder/a-67504897,POLITICS,"In Africa, demands for slavery reparations grow louder 21.11.2023","""It is time for Africa — whose sons and daughters had their freedoms controlled and were sold into slavery — to also receive reparations,"" said Ghana's President Nana Addo Akufo-Addo at a recent reparations conference held in Ghana's capital, Accra.
Akufo-Addo's demand for compensation for the millions of African people sold into slavery, and for other colonial-era injustices inflicted on the continent, are part of a growing world-wide push for compensation.
In the latest sign of the movement's increasing momentum, delegates at the Accra Reparation Conference last week agreed to establish a global reparation fund.
The African Union (AU) and the 20-member Caribbean Community, known as CARICOM, are partnering to form what AU Commission Vice-Chair Monique Nsanzabaganwa called ""a united front"" to right historical injustices and ensure the payment of reparations.
Speaking at the conference, Nsanzabaganwa stressed that Africa had ""borne the brunt of history's injustices, and endured the ramifications of a past marked by slavery, colonization and exploitation.""
""We must acknowledge that these injustices have had a long-term impact, the consequences of which are still felt today,"" she said.
""The demand for reparations is not an attempt to rewrite history or to continue the cycle of victimization. It's a call to recognize the undeniable truth and right the wrongs that have gone unpunished for far too long and continue to thrive presently,"" Nsanzabaganwa added.
Details on how the global fund would operate are still fuzzy.
At least 12.5 million Africans were kidnapped and forcibly transported by European ships and sold into slavery from the 15th to the 19th century, although some estimates put that number at 20 or 30 million. Those who survived the brutal voyage ended up toiling under inhumane conditions in the Americas, mostly in Brazil and the Caribbean, ensuring huge profits for their owners.
The slave trade was dominated by Britain and Portugal, although the US, Netherlands, Spain, France, Denmark and Sweden were also heavily involved.
Anna Hankings-Evans, a German-Ghanaian lawyer with a focus on international economic laws, said it was ""enriching"" to work together with descendants of enslaved Africans from Caribbean and American nations on the quest for reparations.
""I think it is so crucial for us to come together and benefit from each other's thought processes,"" she told DW on the margins of the conference. ""While our experiences are very unique, nevertheless our power lies in togetherness.""
Earlier this month, South African politician Julius Malema joined the debate, after King Charles III's visit to Kenya in October. ""The British… have got no business putting their foot here [in Kenya], except they should pay reparations to Kenyans,"" he said.
In Kenya, King Charles spoke of ""abhorrent and unjustifiable acts of violence"" under British rule, without saying the word ""sorry."" But on social media, Kenyans were less interested in an apology than in tangible reparations.
The month before, the Dutch king and queen were confronted by an angry group of indigenous Khoi and San people protesting their visit to South Africa.
As the royal couple toured Cape Town's Slave Lodge, which once held slaves belonging to the Dutch East India Company, a group of Khoi and San leaders shouted slogans about Dutch colonizers stealing land from their ancestors. They held up signs saying, ""We want compensation.""
Dutch colonizers in South Africa took away Khoi and San land and forced many indigenous South Africans into servitude.
Many studies have attempted to estimate the cost of the slave trade to Africa.
The recent Report on Reparations for Transatlantic Chattel Slavery in the Americas and the Caribbean concluded that under international law slaving nations owe staggering sums. 
The analysis, known as the Battle Report, estimates that the global cost of the slave trade could be as high as $131 trillion (€120 trillion), both for harm perpetrated during the slave era and damages caused post-enslavement.
According to the report, the United States of America owe nearly $27 trillion, Great Britain $24 trillion and Portugal $21 trillion in reparations.
The United Nations recently released a report outlining concrete steps to address the harm suffered by people of African descent.
The document acknowledges that the assessment of the economic damage can ""be extremely difficult owing to the length of time passed and the difficulty of identifying the perpetrators and victims.""
However, it emphasized that, ""such difficulties cannot be the basis for nullifying the existence of underlying legal obligations.""
In an illustration of how politically fraught compensation payments can be, in 2021 Germany recognized the genocide of Herero and Nama people during German colonial rule in what is now Namibia and pledged to pay $1.9 billion to the Namibian government.
The funds are to be spent over 30 years in regions populated by descendants of victims of the Herero and Nama genocide.

Germany was strongly criticized for failing to negotiate directly with Herero and Nama community groups. The declaration, given out jointly with the Namibian government, also didn't include the words ""reparations"" or ""compensation.""
Germany continues to assert that there is no legal basis for individual or collective reparation claims by individual descendants of victim groups such as the Herero and Nama or their associations against the German government.
Rights organizations, including the Berlin-based European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights as well as Human Rights Watch, disagree. They say that Germany does have legal obligations under human rights laws, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
For the AU's Monique Nsanzabaganwa, reparations are more than financial transactions.
""They are a moral and ethical obligation. They represent our acknowledgment of past wrongs, and, more importantly, the resolve to make amends.""

https://www.dw.com/en/openai-appoints-new-boss-sam-altman-joins-microsoft/a-67485749,TECHNOLOGY,"OpenAI appoints new boss, Sam Altman joins Microsoft 20.11.2023","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced on Monday that ousted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, along with co-founder Greg Brockman, will be joining Microsoft to lead a new advanced AI research team.
Former OpenAI President and co-founder Brockman had quit over Altman's firing on Friday.
Meanwhile, tech publication Wired on Monday published what it said was a letter from some of OpenAI's most senior staff members threatening to quit en masse and follow Altman to Microsoft unless the company's board was replaced. 
""Your actions have made it obvious that you are incapable of overseeing OpenAI,"" said the letter. 
Signatories included the company's chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, and even one member of the four-person board that had ousted Altman. 
Microsoft is OpenAI's key business partner and has invested billions of dollars into the startup and helped provide the computing power to run its AI systems.
""We remain committed to our partnership with OpenAI,"" Microsoft's Nadella said as she announced Altman would join the company. ""We look forward to getting to know Emmett Shear and OAI's new leadership team and working with them."" 
OpenAI on Monday named Emmett Shear as an interim CEO to take over from Altman. Shear was previously the CEO of social media company Twitch. 
The company caused further headlines over the weekend by initially announcing that Mira Murati would take over Altman's role, only to later demote her again and leave the top job open once more.   
The tech world was shocked by Altman's sacking at OpenAI. He and the company shot to fame last year amid the hype surrounding the release of a new large language model, ChatGPT, and other products like the image-generating AI Dall-E. 
Many emplyoees were also blindsided by the abrupt change in management. 
Major investors had pushed for reinstating him. However, the board stood by its decision, saying it was ""the only path to advance and defend the mission of OpenAI.""
""Put simply, Sam's behavior and lack of transparency in his interactions with the board undermined the board's ability to effectively supervise the company in the manner it was mandated to do,"" the board said in the memo.
Investors had said Altman's sudden removal could lead to an exodus of talent from the company, and affect an upcoming $86 billion share sale.

https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-summit-aims-to-boost-investment-in-africa/a-67411727,TRADE,Berlin summit aims to boost investment in Africa 19.11.2023,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday will host a meeting of African and G20 nations in Berlin.
The gathering is part of the Compact with Africa (CwA) initiative established during Germany's 2017 presidency of the G20.
The CwA aims to generate additional private investment in the African nations to boost their economies. 
German Vice-Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck will also attend Monday's summit, along with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, ten African heads of state and government, and more than 30 ministers from across the continent.
""Interest in the Compact with Africa has grown steadily,"" said Heiko Schwiderowski, Africa specialist at the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, known by its German abbreviation DIHK.
Schwiderowski emphasized that the investment conference with 800 delegates is being billed as the largest business conference that has ever taken place on German soil.

Germany's business and political leaders are sending out a very important signal, according to Schwiderowski, who said that working to expand economic relations is a worthwhile endeavour. 
Some 13 African countries have so far joined the initiative: Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal, Togo and Tunisia. As one of Africa's largest economies, South Africa holds the co-chairmanship.
Other countries, such as Angola, Zambia, Nigeria and Kenya, are attending the Berlin conference as guests.
Ghanaian analyst Emmanuel Bensah who said that initiatives such as the CwA are an important tool for assessing African economies and also serve as a barometer that measures countries' development, ""because they make it possible to get snapshots of different countries and see what is happening with them and what needs to be improved.""
Bendah is also eyeing the long-delayed African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement that aims to create a single unified market for the continent's 1.3 billion people and to boost economic development. 
XN Iraki, an associate professor at the University of Nairobi specializing in economic growth, said that it is still too early to take stock of the CwA. 
""Compact with Africa was a great idea but six years is too short a time to see the effects,"" Iraki told DW.
Although CwA should attract investors from the G20 countries, the fundamentals on the ground are not necessarily favorable for private investment, Iraki added.
""We don't have very good infrastructure, political instability and the belief that African countries need to be helped by someone.""
However, Iraki believes it is time for African countries to take on more responsibility. ""CwA is still in the development stage, let's give it more time,"" he said.
German economic expert Robert Kappel is more cautious.
""There is a need to reform this model and pay much more attention to the fact that Africa's interests play a much greater role,"" Kappel told DW. ""Africa's interests lie in industrialization, it creates jobs.""
Many African countries have initiated reforms and thus improved the framework conditions. Countries such as Ivory Coast, Ghana, Senegal, Ethiopia and Tunisia have also seen increasing private investment from the G20 countries, but at a rather low level.
Nevertheless only two countries are investing primarily in the energy and raw materials sector: Morocco and Egypt.
Despite the push from Berlin to boost German-African business ties, trade and investment links remain modest.  
Kappel suggested that it would perhaps be more sensible to expand the continent's infrastructure in order to boost intra-African trade.
That would also create new jobs for the majority of the population — something that the G20 Compact with Africa has yet to achieve, he concluded.

Videos shared on social media show Abdul Bari Omar, the director of Afghanistan's food and drug authority, speaking at the mosque on Thursday.
Germany's Foreign Ministry said it had not been informed about Omar's visit to the country and said it had not issued his visa.
""We strongly condemn the appearance of Taliban representative Abdul Bari Omar in Cologne,"" the Foreign Ministry said on social media on Friday.
""We are examining further measures in close dialogue with the interior authorities and partners.""
Federal Interior Minister Nancy Faeser also criticized the incident, saying on Saturday that ""nobody is allowed to offer radical Islamists a stage in Germany.""
""We protect many refugees from Afghanistan from the oppression of the Taliban,"" she said. ""Their functionaries have no business in Germany.""
Omar attended an event at the Chorweiler Mosque in the north of Cologne. The mosque belongs to the umbrella organization DITIB.
DITIB said it had allowed the local Afghan Cultural Association to organize a religious event.
""Contrary to the contractual agreement, it became a political event to which a speaker unknown to us was invited,"" said the local DITIB branch.
""We are deeply disappointed that our trust was exploited in this way,"" the organization added.
DITIB said that the Afghan Cultural Association has now been banned from the premises.
Prior to visiting Germany, Omar was in the Netherlands where he attended a World Health Organization conference in the Hague.
At the event, he was photographed alongside Dutch Health Minister Ernst Kuipers.
Following the scandal in Germany, Kuipers said he regretted the photo and added that he did not realize who Omar was at the time.
Serap Güler, a member of Germany's federal parliament from Cologne who is also on the parliamentary commission into the Afghanistan mission, said she was ""stunned"" by the incident.
""All the details of this matter must now be fully clarified,"" she told Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland.
A spokesperson for the North Rhine-Westphalia administration also condemned the incident.
""The fact that members of a radical organization such as the Taliban are spreading their ideologies unfiltered on German soil is an unspeakable act,"" they told the city's Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger newspaper.
Germany's Foreign Ministry also said there would be no normalization with Taliban authorities if they continue to ""exclude half of the Afghan population from participating in society and blatantly trample on human rights, especially the rights of women and girls.""

https://www.dw.com/en/can-israels-economy-withstand-the-current-conflict/a-67479261,BUSINESS,Can Israel's economy withstand the current conflict? 18.11.2023,"Following evacuation from their homes on the border with the Gaza Strip, tens of thousands of Israelis are now staying in other parts of the country. Many who live along the northern border with Lebanon have also moved to safety. The total number of Israelis who have evacuated is estimated between 200,000 and 250,000. Additionally around 360,000 reservists have also so far been called up to the military.
Businesses have shut down in the zones that locals have evacuated from. What's more, since the Hamas attack on October 7 that killed 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and sparked the current conflict, tourism has ceased, cutting off one of the country's main sources of income. Hardly any foreign airlines still fly to Israel, Dan Ben-David, a professor and the head of the Shoresh Institution for Socioeconomic Research based at Tel Aviv University, told DW.
So far this rupture to economic life remains under control, he said. ""But the impact depends on a whole range of variables. How long will the war last? Will Hezbollah intervene in the war? And if the war continues, how long will we need the reservists?""
If 360,000 people are in the army, then many spouses will have to forgo working in order to care for children, especially since many schools have been closed, Ben-David added.
The war will also put major strain on another key sector, the tech industry. ”In Israel, only around 10% of employees work in the high-tech sector but they are responsible for over 50% of our exports,"" Ben-David said.
Most of these workers are relatively young and now serving in the military in Gaza or on the Lebanese border. The problem is not with percentages, where one might think that the gross domestic product (GDP) would drop by 20% if 20% of the workforce is drafted into the army, he explained. Instead, it centers on who exactly these recruits are: They are young, well educated, and highly productive.
By contrast, those who haven't been conscripted tend to have lower productivity, the researcher said. 
Gilad Malach, director of the ultra-Orthodox society program at the Israel Democracy Institute, estimates that almost half of all ultra-Orthodox men do not work. They and their often large families receive billions in state subsidies that the ultra-Orthodox coalition partners of  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would like to increase even further.
""Because we are so dependent on the high-tech industry, which is both good and bad, we have put all our best eggs in one basket,"" Ben-David argued, adding that a setback in this area impacts the entire country.
In the past, the tech industry has buffered the worst effects of economic crises, helping Israel emerge from recessions more quickly and avoid economic downturns that hurt other parts of the world.
After the second intifada — a period of violence and Palestinian uprising between September 2000 to February 2005 — the country's economy was in bad shape. ""But the economic upturn that followed was phenomenal because tech was the main driver of growth,” Ben-David said. ""Then came the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, the worst recession in the Western world since the Great Depression of the 1930s. But Israel didn't even feel it because the high-tech industry around the world barely felt it. And because tech is very important here, we didn't notice anything.”
Israel experienced the COVID-19 pandemic in a similar way. While every country was affected by the pandemic, with millions barely working for some time, Israel recovered more quickly than most thanks to the strength of its tech industry.
Ben-David concludes that if the war with Hamas does not last too long and Hezbollah does not enter the war, then the Israeli economy could quickly regain its former strength.
But this will depend on whether Netanyahu and his supporters remain in power. Before the war began, mass protests against his judicial reforms had kept the country on tenterhooks.
""Although the economy has not come to a complete standstill, investment has fallen significantly,” Ben-David said. ""Investment in the high-tech sector declined, share prices fell. Many Israelis withdrew their money from the country and the shekel was devalued considerably.”
The real question is what happens after the war, the economist said. ""If we can kick Netanyahu and his cronies out and restore order, the high-tech sector should probably remain intact. But what happens if not?""
More money would likely flow out of Israel as tech companies turn their backs on the country, Ben-David said, citing a trend that had already emerged among startups before the current conflict. In the first nine months of 2023, most Israeli startups were founded in the US and elsewhere, rather than in Israel, which means a loss in tax revenue, he added.
During the mass protests against judicial reforms, it became clear that a number of prominent tech entrepreneurs disagreed with Netanyahu's politics. In fact, many who led and even supported the anti-government demonstrations financially came from the tech sector, such as entrepreneurs Moshe Radman and Ami Dror.
""The unusual thing was that in the past these tech people would never have gotten involved in anything to do with politics. They were simply too busy developing ideas and making money,” Ben-David said. ”But when they realized that the future of the country was at stake, they acted.”
If Netanyahu stays in power, important tech industry figures, along with scientists and doctors, could also consider leaving Israel, the economist said.
For example, another central figure in the anti-government protests was leading physicist Shikma Bressler, a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, central Israel. 
Ben-David believes the danger of an exodus by academics like Bressler and other professionals was already brewing before October 7. In August and September, there was a sharp increase in Israeli doctors applying to the Ministry of Health for official certificates confirming their expertise and work records — the first step in applying to work abroad.
According to the Bloomberg media outlet, the war is costing Israel around $260 million (Є238 million) a day. In October alone, Israel's budget deficit soared sevenfold. By the end of that month the national currency, the shekel, fell to an 11-year low against the dollar, though it has since stabilized following interventions by the Israeli central bank. However the Ministry of Finance in Jerusalem has announced it will increase government borrowing by a further 75 percent in November.
In a column on Friday that was critical of Jerusalem’s proposed policies to address the economic strain of the war, Bloomberg columnist Marc Champion summed up the difficult economic situation as follows: ”Israel is a country at war, with its expenditures exploding, revenue reduced and borrowing costs on the rise.”

https://www.dw.com/en/economic-ties-between-germany-and-turkey-remain-top-priority/a-67428722,POLITICS,Economic ties between Germany and Turkey remain top priority 16.11.2023,"Despite countless political controversies and crises in recent years, economic ties between Germany and Turkey have been improving steadily. For years, Germany has ranked as one of Turkey's largest trading partners and top foreign investors.
According to the German Foreign Ministry, bilateral trade between the two countries ""reached a record high"" of €51.6 billion ($56 billion) in 2022. Compared to the previous year, Turkish exports to Germany increased by 26.7% to €24.6 billion, and Turkish imports from Germany grew by one-third to €27 billion.
Germany remains the most important destination for Turkish exports. The Turkish Exporters' Assembly (TIM) estimates that Turkey exported the equivalent of €14.5 billion worth of goods to Germany to the end of October this year. These goods mainly include products for the automotive industry, textiles, foodstuffs, boilers, and intermediate goods made from iron, steel, and aluminum.
Turkey mostly imports machines, vehicles, plastic products, aircraft, chemicals and medical equipment from Germany. Only Russia and China deliver more goods to Turkey than Germany.
Ayhan Zeytinoglu, president of the Istanbul-based Economic Development Foundation (IKV), said that German-Turkish economic relations were deep-rooted and crisis-proof. ""Among Turkey's largest trading partners, Germany is at the forefront. We have a remarkable trade deficit with Russia and China, yet we enjoy a balanced relationship with Germany.""
In addition to other pressing matters that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan must tend to as he visits Berlin, Turkish business representatives have also called on him to address Turkey's customs union with the European Union. They want Germany to use its influence to push for modernization.
According to Zeytinonglu, modernizing the customs union could see trade volume double to some €90 billion. ""We hope to see some steps taken during our president's visit,"" he said.
The customs union has been in place since 1995 and provides for a free exchange of goods between both countries, as well as an alignment of tariffs and regulations.
Critics calling for reform point to difficulties in consultation and dispute resolution arrangements, while Turkey has complained that visa restrictions for businesspeople and truck drivers are hindering the free movement of goods.

Exporters are also dissatisfied with the current state of affairs. Bulent Aymen is vice president of the Mediterranean Furniture, Paper and Forestry Products Exporters' Association (AKIB). He explained that the customs union was over 25 years old and that global trade had evolved during this time. ""The customs union is no longer able to satisfy the economy's needs,"" he said.
He worries that the topic will be pushed aside during Erdogan's visit. ""But it is a very urgent and important topic for the Turkish economy. I hope it will at least be brought up in Germany,"" Aymen added.
The German Chamber of Commerce Abroad (AHK) estimates that German businesses invested about €11.5 billion in Turkey between 2002 and 2022. This means that over 6% of foreign investment in Turkey is from Germany.
Over 8,000 German companies — either German-owned or with German investment — operate in Turkey, predominantly in industry, retail, logistics, and sales.
Zeytinoglu believes that Germany and Turkey need each other. ""Turkey can benefit from Germany's technological and financial strength, and Germany can profit from Turkey's geopolitical might. Together, when it comes to the customs union, we can create new synergies,"" he said.
Turkish business representatives are also calling for Turkey to have a say in EU free trade deals. Zeytinoglu called it a ""great injustice"" that the EU would sign free trade agreements with third countries without involving Turkey. ""As a member of the customs union, we should be at the table when such agreements are made,"" he said.
Because of this, Aymen said that Turkey is suffering ""great losses"" in foreign markets. He believes that Turkish businesses today would be far more successful in a number of countries, including South Africa and Algeria, if Turkey had been involved in free trade negotiations.
In addition to traditional areas of trade, new lines of business between both nations have also been emerging in recent years. Most concern the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources.
In 2012, both governments launched the German-Turkish Energy Partnership, designed to allow representatives from politics, business, science, and civil society to exchange thoughts on the energy transition.
German wind turbine manufacturers such as Enercon and Nordex have large plants in Turkey.
Time and again, the rhetoric of Turkey's leadership has shaken investors' faith in the country.
In June, Erdogan appointed Mehmet Simsek as head of the country's economy portfolio in the hopes of curbing inflation and scoring points abroad.
Simsek is an internationally recognized financial expert and stands for a liberal market approach. He served as finance minister from 2009 to 2015, which was a relatively liberal age for the ruling AKP government.
Now, Simsek is on the road, working to restore faith in Turkey — so far, without much success, it would seem. The Turkish lira has continued to slip since the country voted for a new parliament in May. Shortly before the election, €1 cost around 21.50 Turkish lira. These days, it is over 31 lira.
At a July panel discussion in Salzburg, Austria, Simsek urged the EU to modernize the customs union. EU Commissioner for the Economy Paolo Gentiloni responded evasively, revealing how troubled relations between Europe and Turkey currently are.
There are ""difficult topics"" that need to be hammered out, Gentiloni said. Time would tell ""if progress is possible.""

https://www.dw.com/en/turkeys-erdogan-visits-germany-amid-divisions-over-israel/a-67418568,POLITICS,Turkey's Erdogan visits Germany amid divisions over Israel 16.11.2023,"Turkish-German relations have reached a low point. War in the Middle East is the chief cause, given the countries' divergent views on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has resorted to harsh rhetoric criticizing Israel and defending Hamas, which Turkey's Western allies like Germany consider a terrorist organization.
For 75 years, Israel has been trying to ""establish a state on land that was stolen from the Palestinian people,"" Erdogan said recently in Ankara. Israel's legitimacy is being called into question by its ""own fascism,"" he added.
At a news conference in Berlin on Tuesday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Erdogan's comments ""absurd,"" stressing that Israel is a democracy.
Josef Schuster, head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, the official but by no means only representative of Germany's Jews, also attacked Erdogan. He accused him of ""fueling the protests on German streets and the psychological terror against Jews in Germany with his propaganda.""

While some officials have suggested canceling the visit due the controversy, the German government wanted to push ahead. The opposition center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) agreed. Their leader, Friedrich Merz, said Turkey is too important for Germany. The two sides could not afford to stop talking with each other.
Germany is home to about 1.5 million people with Turkish citizenship. Two-thirds of them voted for Erdogan in elections earlier this year, in a vote that international observers called free but unfair.
Turkey, which is struggling economically, benefits from good business ties with Germany and the European Union. Conversely, Turkey is an important partner in efforts to stymie the flow of refugees heading toward the EU.

Seven years ago, Erdogan reached an agreement with the EU to stop smugglers and take back migrants whose asylum applications were rejected in neighboring Greece. In return, Ankara received billions of euros to accommodate the people in the country. The EU is hoping for a revival of this refugee pact.
Turkey can also serve as a crisis mediator, as it has been doing between Ukraine and Russia. The recent conflict between Israel and Hamas has raised Turkey's profile even more in this regard.
""It's important that the war there does not spread, and of course, Turkey also plays a role in this,"" Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, who chairs Germany's parliamentary defense committee, told DW. ""In this respect, we have to talk to each other. The question is, how direct we can be.""
Erdogan will arrive in Berlin on Friday afternoon, according to the released agenda. He will be received first by German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and will then dine with Scholz at the chancellery.
Observers have said the German government hopes to limit Erdogan's public exposure. On a three-day visit in 2018, he held rallies, lashed out at Kurdish activists and drew street protests that criticized Turkey's human rights record on his watch. More famously, he held a rally in 2010 attended by 15,000 people in the western city of Cologne, which is home to a large Turkish community.
At the time, he told the crowd that Turkish immigrants should integrate and learn German, but that ""nobody can expect you to assimilate.""










Initially, Erdogan was scheduled to attend the men's international soccer match between Germany and Turkey at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin on Saturday. But this event has been canceled.
People in Berlin can expect enhanced security in the city during Erdogan's visit, especially around the government area. The measures are likely to extend into Saturday, as thousands of Kurds intend to protest Erdogan's policies and express support for the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has been banned in Germany for decades.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-number-of-bankruptcies-continues-to-grow/a-67399803,BUSINESS,Germany: Number of bankruptcies continues to grow 14.11.2023,"Germany is seeing a growing number of businesses and individuals apply for insolvency as well as declaring bankruptcy according to its Federal Statistics Office (Destatis), which published preliminary details from an annual report on Tuesday.
According to the office's data, insolvency applications rose 22.4% in October 2023 as compared to October 2022. That number had been 19.5% in September.
Statisticians said they have consistently registered double-digit increases since June.
The actual timing of such fluctuations is imprecise, however, as the processing of applications can drag on for several months.
The office added that these statistics only apply to those companies that go out of business within the framework of an orderly insolvency process and not those that are subject to forced bankruptcy due to inability to pay their bills or for other reasons.

Despite the increasing trend — fueled in part by a weak overall economy — experts said they do not expect a tsunami of bankruptcies across the country, calling the phenomenon a natural thinning of businesses that simply are not prepared for the future.
""We won't be seeing jumps like those of the early 2000s — with more than 30,000 bankruptcies per year — in the future,"" said Christoph Niering, chairman of the German Registered Association of Insolvency Administrators (VID), last week in Berlin.
Niering said it was reasonable for companies to seek help but added that, ""specialized labor shortages and demographic trends show how important it is to consciously remove those businesses with no future-viable business concept from the market.""
He added that state assistance and relaxed rules regarding forced insolvency during the coronavirus pandemic and the energy crisis had artificially kept companies above water. Niering said it is therefore normal that insolvencies are now on the rise.
The Federal Statistics Office said commercial bankruptcies rose by more than one-third in August (the most recent month with final numbers), with 1,556 declarations, or a 35.7% year-on-year increase over August 2022.
Total commercial debt owed to creditors in August 2023 was estimated at roughly €1.8 billion ($1.95 billion), €1 billion more than in 2022.

Statistics show that from a baseline of 10,000 companies, some 4.6% filed for bankruptcy. Of these, businesses in the transportation and storage sectors were hardest hit (9.9%). These were followed by service industry businesses (7%).
Christoph Niering of the VID warned that the trend would continue to affect those businesses using lots of energy as well as those in the health sector, saying bankruptcies would likely hit the construction and real estate sectors next.
""Higher interest rates and significantly lower demand will not put developers under pressure and could also hit smaller construction companies soon,"" he said.
Those least affected by the trend were those in the energy sector (0.6%). 
Lastly, statisticians registered an 8.6% jump in consumer bankruptcies in August, with 5,843 filings.

https://www.dw.com/en/ethiopia-and-eritrea-is-a-new-war-looming/a-67394344,CONFLICTS,Ethiopia and Eritrea: Is a new war looming? 14.11.2023,"When Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came into office in April 2018, he worked to secure a peace deal with former foe and neighbor, Eritrea.
Abiy and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki signed a historic peace deal later the same year to end decades of fighting.
This earned Abiy the Noble Peace Prize and the admiration of the world — but now there are emerging fears that all the gains made five years ago could soon be lost.
At the center of these concerns is Ethiopia's quest to have access to a port on the Red Sea, specifically the port of Assab. It's located in Eritrea, which was part of Ethiopia until it gained independence more than 30 years ago.
Since 1998, Ethiopia's access to the port of Assab has been truncated due to a 20-year border war between the neighboring nations that killed tens of thousands of people.
The conflict forced Ethiopia to channel its goods and other port-related trades through neighboring country of Djibouti, which borders both Ethiopia and Eritrea.
""When they [Eritreans] declared their independence, they were boasting about their ports, that they [will] use them [for developments], they were singing for their ports. [A lot has] been said about the significance of the ports,"" Ato Yesuf Yasin, a former Ethiopian diplomat, told DW.
However, Yasin said that since then, Eritrea's ports haven't served any country in the Horn of Africa region.
""But now the main issue is that neither Ethiopia nor Eritrea, nor the people of Afar who live in and around the coastal areas, benefit from the ports,"" he added, referring to the Ethiopian region that borders Tigray and Eritrea.
Prime Minister Abiy said Ethiopia deserves a port of its own, which shouldn't come at a huge cost, and has signaled his country's readiness to regain access to the Assab port.
""The Red Sea and the Nile will determine Ethiopia. They are interlinked with Ethiopia and will be the fundamentals that will either bring in Ethiopia's development or bring about its demise,"" Abiy Ahmed said last month during a televised speech to Ethiopian lawmakers.

Drawing lessons from the controversy surrounding construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Nile River, Abiy suggested that conversations around the port on the Red Sea shouldn't be off limits.
""The thing that saddens me the most and pains me is that discussing the Red Sea agenda even at the level of parliamentarians is considered a taboo,"" he said.
In July, Abiy was also reported to have spoken on the same topic of the ports, telling a meeting of business executives that Ethiopia wanted to ""get a port by peaceful means."" But, he added, ""if that fails, we will use force.""
But recently, the prime minister appeared to change his mind about his willingness to use force to secure access to the port.
""Ethiopia has never invaded any country and will not do so in the future,"" Abiy said publicly when speaking with soldiers.
But in his October 13 speech, Abiy also said he wanted the issue of access to the port resolved peacefully.
""Because we have a legitimate question, we are 100 million, have an army […] we should not become one that jumps and chokes a country of others; this is not correct. We don't have that interest. Is this thing possible peacefully? Yes, it is possible; because everyone who wants joint benefit, joint prosperity, joint development, joint peace will do it,"" he said.
Ato Abdurehman Seid, a political analyst on the Horn of Africa, told DW that Abiy's recent pronouncements are diversionary, a year after ending an internal Ethiopian conflict with the country's Tigray region.  

""For Prime Minster Abiy Ahmed, to raise the issue of port [at this time] might help him to divert the [public] attentions from internal economic and military crises,"" he said.
Fidel Amakye Owusu, a conflict resolution and international relations expert, agreed. He told DW that Abiy is only trying to solidify his political position ahead of a general election, blaming a worsening economic situation on the fact that Ethiopia lacks a port.
""Abiy, having legitimacy issues and issues with elections and how to be domestically strong, now wants to pursue his own survival and that of his government,"" he said. ""The goal is economic at the same time political. Because when he is able to make economic gains for Ethiopia it gives him more legitimacy, it gives him more support to stay on.""
Owusu added that Abiy can only succeed with his attempt to secure access to Eritrean ports if he rides on the agenda of nationalism, a sentiment he is already whipping up, according to the expert.
""Currently what Abiy is trying to say is that the early '90s unilateral declaration of independence [by Eritrea] may not be technically valid to the Ethiopians and therefore they would need a port,"" he explained. ""So even if they would not need the whole of Eritrea, they would need a port that is legitimately theirs.""
But Seid believes Abiy will not find successful with this approach.
""It may have some political benefits, [but] I don't think he would dare to invade Eritrea, even if he wants, he doesn't have the capacity to execute,"" he said.

Abiy enjoyed a significant amount of backing among Ethiopians for the war in Tigray between 2020 and 2022, which displaced millions of people. Eritrea supported his government during that particular conflict, as an ally.
Seid, however, said the Eritrean government wasn't happy with how the conflict with Tigray ended. He suggested the friendship struck in 2018 between Ethiopia and Eritrea may not be a lasting one.
""The Eritrean president Isaias [Afwerki] thinks the civil war that took place in Ethiopia [...] did not produce an important result. Because [the war] did not destroy TPLF from the political game,"" he said, referring to the Tigray People's Liberation Front.
Seid said the terms of the peace agreement signed between the Ethiopian government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front  didn't excite Eritrea.
""The agreement [signed not only] confirmed the existence of TPLF but also guaranteed TPLF control [of] all the territories they used to administer,"" he said, adding that Abiy's ""unilateral"" actions also ""excluded the Amharas and Eritrea,"" who fought the TPLF alongside the Ethiopian government.
""This created disappointment,"" he said.
Eritrea has already condemned Abiy's comments and posturing, expressing worry. 
A government statement said ""discourses — both actual and presumed — on water, access to the sea, and related topics floated in the recent times are numerous and excessive indeed. The affair has perplexed all concerned observers.""
Estifanos Afeworki, an Eritrean diplomat and the country's ambassador to Japan, was even more explicit, saying his country would always defend its territory.
""There is no if and but about Eritrea's sovereignty and territorial integrity. No amount of illegitimate instigation, propaganda, conspiracy, and defamation can change this truth,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on October 12 — even before Abiy's address to parliament.
Owusu said Ethiopia would have to reassess its push for a port using force, since doing so could plunge the region into another conflict.
""This is very controversial; it is not going to just happen because countries in the region are all concerned,"" he said. ""Ethiopia is now sounding more aggressive. The kind of hope and anticipation they had of Abiy is going the other way.""
Owusu said Abiy should rather approach the entire quest for a port diplomatically, in order not to spark another conflict.
""Your attitude towards your neighbors must change, become more pacific as he started earlier when he took over,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/waves-of-waste-the-harsh-truth-about-ocean-plastic/a-67370326,NATURE AND ENVIRONMENT,Waves of waste: The harsh truth about ocean plastic 13.11.2023,"Just below the surface of the world's largest ocean, toothbrushes, children's toys, fishing nets and food packaging all coalesce into a thick soup of oil and gas-based waste, known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
At least 14 million tons of plastic enter the ocean each year, according to the IUCN, an international nature conservation organization. There, it is being ingested by animals, entering the food chain and damaging ecosystems.
However phenomenal the volume, nonprofit The Ocean Cleanup believes it can deal with the bulk of the mess by dragging massive u-shaped nets through rubbish hotspots at sea and using floating barriers to intercept trash from about 1,000 polluted rivers.
In the decade since it began, The Ocean Cleanup says it has removed about 7.5 million tons of plastic, and with sufficient funding believes it can clear away 90% of plastic floating on the surface.
But the organization, which has received funding from the likes of Coca Cola and polymer producer SABIC owned by oil company Saudi Aramco, has been criticized for helping to greenwash companies linked to plastic pollution.
Nonprofits Oceancare in Switzerland and the UK-based Environmental Investigation Agency see such ocean cleanup technologies as a distraction from stemming the flow of mismanaged plastic waste in the first place.
""It's like sticking a Band Aid on a broken leg,"" said Christina Dixon, ocean campaign leader at the Environmental Investigation Agency. ""It sounds good on paper, but it's not really addressing the actual big impact of plastic pollution on the environment.""
She said a focus on expensive cleanup operations is misdirecting resources to the wrong end of the problem, and that such technologies are emissions intensive. They can also inadvertently harm marine life in the process of catching plastic, though The Ocean Cleanup disputes this.

Dixon spoke to DW from Kenya's capital Nairobi, where international delegates are meeting this week to try piece together an ambitious global treaty to end plastic pollution, similar to the Paris Agreement on climate change.
As fossil fuel companies such as ExxonMobil and Saudi Aramco invest heavily in plastic production to hedge against the renewable energy transition, mismanaged plastic waste will double by 2060 globally, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Without significant action, there may be more plastic than fish in the ocean, by weight, by 2050.
""If the bath is filling and overflowing, you can try and put a pump in and start pumping it out. But really, we've got to go to the source to turn the tap off,"" said Marcus Gover, the plastics initiative director at Australian non-profit Minderoo Foundation. 
Gover said negotiators in Nairobi have a choice of options in front of them to address plastic pollution, much like a restaurant menu.
""If we make the right choices, we could come up with a meal that's really good for us. But equally, if we make the wrong choices and go for the fast food options on there, then it's not going to be healthy,"" Gover said.
Modeling of potential agreements suggests that a robust treaty could reduce mismanaged plastic waste up to 95% by 2040 compared to a business-as-usual scenario.
This approach would require globally binding rules to reduce plastic production, eliminate problematic and avoidable plastics, expand circularity, and improve disposal methods.
Felix Cornehl, a former UK government advisor involved in the modeling said it would require a seven-fold increase in global recycling rates and would still leave room for even more robust action.
""If we have limited resources available, stopping that flow from the beginning and going upstream — reducing unnecessary production of plastic and keeping produced plastic in the system as long as possible are cheaper, but I think there is still a place for helping communities deal with the waste that is currently in the system,"" Cornehl said.
But addressing upstream production might prove difficult, given the influence of plastic producers in the talks, according to a group of scientists who are advising delegates in Nairobi.
Bethanie Carney Almroth, a professor of ecotoxicology at Sweden's University of Gothenburg, said pro-plastic lobbyists are working to stall progress on capping production, sowing doubt with techniques similar to Big Tobacco's efforts to block smoking regulation.
Almroth said all scientific evidence shows that capping the production of plastic was essential to ending plastic pollution, but that lobbyists were seizing on end-of-life technologies such as ocean cleanups and chemical recycling to divert action.
""It's a way for companies to sort of buy themselves free,"" Almroth said. ""It's like a 'Get Out of Jail Free' card.""
But the people doing the dirty cleanup work don't see it as a binary choice.
""We need to do something about production, we need to change our behavior when it comes to plastic usage, but we also need to take out the stuff that is already out there,"" said The Ocean Cleanup's director of communications, Joost Dubois.
""The cleanup is just one element of what will lead to the end of plastic pollution. We mop the floor, but somebody will also have to work on closing the tap.""

https://www.dw.com/en/decoding-china-xi-and-biden-have-to-find-common-ground/a-67370308,POLITICS,Decoding China: Xi and Biden have to find common ground 11.11.2023,"The person who photographs Chinese President Xi Jinping with his US counterpart Joe Biden when they meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit — set to take place November 11-17 in the US city of San Francisco — will be faced with a task of responsibility.
The photo will illustrate the relationship between two nations, which are rivals in terms of economics and security policy. The stakes are high: if they do not cooperate, global challenges such as climate change cannot be met.
The media and the public will be paying attention to facial expressions, posture and the whole setting to interpret the relationship between the two. At least physically, however, they will be meeting eye to eye: Biden is 1.83 meters (ca. 6 feet) tall, Xi is probably about 1.80 meters. But it is not exactly certain, as China treats information like this as it would a state secret.
The last meeting between the two leaders took place in November 2022, at the G20 summit on the Indonesian island of Bali. Since then, there have been lively political consultations, but Xi and Biden have not directly exchanged views face to face.
Helena Legarda, a lead analyst from the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS), said: ""Xi and Biden will be discussing current issues. That is relatively clear. However, it is uncertain whether they will reach a consensus. There may not be much outcome out of this summit.""

The relationship between China and the US pits two very different political systems against one another. China is an authoritarian one-party state that has become the second-largest economy in the world. Beijing has said it wants to be the strongest country in the world by 2050. A communist country that for decades fought unsuccessfully, albeit hard, against the Western alliance during the Cold War hopes to have replaced the US as a global superpower by then. The US — the world's largest economy and a democracy — wants to defend its place.
The two countries are engaged in fierce competition on many levels. The economy is one issue, especially the high-tech sector regarding semiconductors, digitalization and artificial intelligence. But geopolitical interests also play a role, with China wanting to forge alliances with non-Western countries and reshape the US-dominated world order. Ultimately, the question is whether a communist autocracy or a capitalist democracy will become the ideological model of the 21st century.
In 1972, the US — under President Richard Nixon — established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. These have undergone rapid development over the past few decades, particularly since the introduction of reform and opening-up policies under Deng Xiaoping in 1978.
China has been able to create close interdependent relationships with other states thanks to its major economic muscle. Its huge market has attracted numerous investors from Europe and the US who have brought capital and technical know-how. For example, in 2022, German car manufacturers VW, BMW and Mercedes generated an average 35% of their respective revenues in China.
At the same time, China has invested in Africa, Central Asia, Latin America, and most recently, the Arab world. Its Belt and Road Initiative, also known as the New Silk Road, which has two trade routes, one land and one maritime, is one prominent project. China also plays a leading role in the BRICS+ group of major emerging economies. Originally comprised of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, the group is being expanded to include six more members. Some 40 countries have expressed an interest in joining.
""China is practicing a form of statecraft that uses economic leverage to try to achieve political goals in relation to other states,"" said Markus Taube, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen and economic expert on China.
At a German-Chinese business conference in Düsseldorf last week, Taube said: ""China wants more influence in the global system and is also demanding it. As a result, there is more antagonism with the Western world. We are experiencing the renaissance of 'economic statecraft' as an instrument for pursuing higher national goals."" According to the US think tank, the Atlantic Council, ""economic statecraft is the use of financial, regulatory, and economic tools to achieve foreign policy objectives.""

Ironically, it was initially the West that wanted to generate change through ""economic statecraft,"" particularly in the 1990s. The German catchphrase was ""Wandel durch Handel"" (change through trade). ""German theorists of order thought that complex economies could not function without liberal social models. That 'change through trade' would set in motion a process of harmonization. We can see today that this is not entirely correct,"" explained Taube. China has proven that capitalism and autocracy are an excellent match.
""The big challenge for Western countries and the ultimately long-term concern would be that China has expressed its ambition to reform the current global order, rules, values and principles so that they are more in line with their own,"" said Legarda from MERICS.
The US-led Group of 7 (G7), a liberal-democratic group of seven industrialized nations — and of which Germany is a member — has offered to work with China on, ""global challenges as well as areas of common interest."" A G7 Foreign Ministers' statement released after their meeting in Japan on November 8 asserts: ""We stand prepared to build constructive and stable relations with China, recognizing the importance of engaging candidly and expressing our concerns directly.""

Ahead of Xi's visit to the US, there have been calls for President Biden to respond more decisively to Chinese provocations in the China Sea and elsewhere. But for China and the US to overcome common challenges, a pragmatic alliance is necessary, despite systemic rivalry. The West is also struggling to find like-minded companions in this epic competition. ""As democracies, we can only hold our own in a systemic competition with autocratic forces if our friends around the globe sense that we are serious.,"" said Federal Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock prior to her departure for Tokyo.

https://www.dw.com/en/israel-hamas-war-which-side-is-china-on/a-67357842,CONFLICTS,Israel-Hamas war: Which side is China on? 09.11.2023,"Standing on the banks of the Huangpu river in China's financial capital Shanghai, one cannot miss the Peace Hotel, a tall building with a green copper roof that overlooks the surrounding areas. 
What many don't know is that the building, formerly called the Cathay Hotel, was built by Jewish businessman Victor Sassoon in 1929. 
Sassoon moved to Shanghai in the 1920s and established a business empire there. During World War II, he supported the building of a settlement of around 2.5 square kilometers, where around 20,000 European Jews fleeing Nazi persecution found protection.
But after the war and the seizure of power in China by the communists, most Jews left Shanghai. Victor Sassoon was forced to sell his companies to the Chinese Communist Party for a pittance.
The Sassoon case highlights the disdain with which the communists treated the Jews and, later, the then-newly-formed state of Israel.
During the Cold War, China declared solidarity with its Arab allies and often voted against Israel at the United Nations. Indeed, it was not until 1992 that China and Israel officially established diplomatic relations.
Since establishing formal diplomatic ties, China has viewed Israel primarily as a trading partner. Both sides have traded goods worth about $22 billion (€20.5 billion) so far this year.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was due to travel to China in October 2023 and the conclusion of a free trade agreement between the two sides was high on the agenda.
But the trip was postponed due to the multifront terror attacks on Israel by the Hamas militant group.
Official documents from both countries focus mostly on the economy and trade. They rarely mention the conflict in the Middle East. The official statement following Netanyahu's last visit to Beijing in 2017, for instance, merely stated that China wanted to promote joint innovations with Israel and support high-tech start-ups.
China also always views Israel through the prism of its ties to the US, Beijing's major geopolitical rival.
Zhang Jun, China's ambassador to the UN who took over the chairmanship of the UN Security Council in November, said: ""China solemnly calls on a certain major country, with special influence on the parties concerned, to put aside its self interests and geopolitical considerations, and make every effort to stop the war and restore peace.""
Zhang was referring to the US, which he implicitly accused of having an interest in the ongoing war.
""Israel is a robust democracy, firmly anchored in its alliance with the United States of America,"" Eberhard Sandschneider, political scientist and partner at the consulting firm Berlin Global Advisors, told DW. ""From a Chinese perspective, Israel is, therefore, geopolitically on the other side of what China is currently planning, namely a strengthening of the anti-Western alliance.""
The government in Beijing claims to be a neutral player in the Middle East conflict.
Still, China has criticized Israel in particular.
China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has described the Israeli hostilities as ""disproportionate"" and said that they far exceeded the limits of self-defense. The people in Gaza should not be collectively punished, Wang stressed. In the UN Security Council, the Chinese ambassador said Beijing wanted to take into account the legitimate security interests of both warring parties and restore peace.
Beijing has no regular contact with the Islamist terror organization Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip. But it does maintain links with the leadership of the Palestinian Authority.
China inked a ""comprehensive strategic partnership with Palestine [Palestinians]"" earlier this year.
Following talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, in June, the final communique stated: ""China supports the establishment of a sovereign state of Palestine [Palestinians] on the basis of the 1967 border demarcation and with East Jerusalem as its capital. China supports the resumption of peace talks between Palestinians and Israel on the basis of the principle of 'land for peace,' the relevant UN resolutions and the two-state solution.""
In return, the Palestinian Authority has committed itself to the ""one-China policy."" It has also adopted the Chinese narrative that the situation in Xinjiang, China's far-western and predominantly Muslim autonomous region, is ""not about human rights issues at all, but about fighting terrorism, radicalization and separatism.""
Beijing has set up a comprehensive surveillance apparatus in the province to monitor the Uyghur community there. The United Nations has slammed Beijing for committing ""serious human rights violations"" and accused it of possible ""crimes against humanity.""
China has always maintained close political ties with Palestinians, said political analyst Sandschneider. ""There are historical reasons for this. Supporting liberation movements is part of the self-image of Chinese foreign policy.""
However, that's not the case when it comes to Xinjiang or Taiwan, he added.
In this context, China is looking for supporters in the Arab world to defend its repression of the Uyghurs. If Beijing were to lose support in the Arab world, the separatist forces in Xinjiang could receive more backing from Muslim countries. Any uprising by an ethnic minority would be the worst-case scenario for the Communist Party leadership, for whom the unity of the country is a top priority.
China has had a special envoy for the Middle East since 2019. The diplomat has been tasked with promoting the peace process between Israel and its Arab neighbors, among other things.
Since the outbreak of the war between Israel and Hamas, the current envoy, Zhai Jun, has been in contact with various parties and several Arab countries. He has stated that China is in favor of peace and sees ""the failure to protect the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people"" as the cause of the ongoing conflict. He underlined that China and Russia shared the same position on the conflict and were working together to de-escalate it.

The emphasis on proximity to Russia follows a pattern. China has increasingly focused on non-Western partners in recent years, while at the same time significantly increasing its global visibility, Sandschneider said. ""China had essentially stayed out of the Middle East conflict in recent decades. But now we are seeing China positioning itself as a mediator, as it has done between Saudi Arabia and Iran.""
In April 2023, China successfully mediated a rapprochement between the two Gulf rivals, making global headlines. Sandschneider believes China won't be able to repeat such a success when it comes to the war between Israel and Hamas. ""China's credibility is pretty limited in this particular case between Israel and Hamas.""

https://www.dw.com/en/kristallnacht-not-strong-enough-term-for-anti-jewish-riots/a-67357689,HISTORY,'Kristallnacht' not strong enough term for anti-Jewish riots 09.11.2023,"Words have meaning. They shape how people feel about an issue, remember events, and respond to developments impacting their lives.
For decades, people in Germany have referred to the anti-Jewish violence that cascaded across the country on November 9, 1938, as the ""Kristallnacht"" or ""Reichskristallnacht"" — a prefix referring to the German empire. The translation ""Night of Broken Glass"" is widely used in English.
In Germany, that has begun to change. Historians debate the origins of the term ""Kristallnacht,"" but it has nevertheless entered the lexicon of German history as such, ""owing its name to the shards of shattered glass that lined German streets,"" according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) in Washington, DC.
The problem is that broken glass is hardly the worst consequence of a night of terror that many historians mark as the beginning of the Holocaust and the systematic murder of millions of Jews and people from other groups.
""The term obscures the atrocities that were committed against Jewish citizens,"" Meier Schwarz, a German-born Holocaust survivor and Israeli academic who died in 2022, once wrote for schoah.org, an online Holocaust archive.
Hundreds of people were killed, according to USHMM, and 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and deported to concentration camps.
Rioters that night set fire to hundreds of synagogues and Jewish institutions throughout Austria and Germany. They desecrated Jewish cemeteries and looted thousands of Jewish-owned businesses. Then, Nazi authorities ordered Jews to pay for the damages.
Given the scope and gravity of the events, ""broken glass"" does not capture the extent of the brutality and suffering. By using more direct and explicit terminology, Germany aims to ensure that the historical record reflects the nature of the atrocities committed.

For many, such as Meier Schwarz, a more appropriate term would be ""pogrom,"" a Russian word deriving from a verb meaning ""to wreak havoc, to demolish violently."" As such, ""Pogromnacht"" — night of pogroms — has become more common in recent Holocaust discourse in Germany.
""Kristallnacht,"" or its English equivalent, remains in common use outside Germany, including by English-language media and Jewish organizations. The USHMM uses it but further defines what happened as an ""organized act of nationwide violence"" and a ""wave of violent anti-Jewish pogroms.""
Not all historians are pleased with that choice, however. They say ""pogrom"" is a generic term that can apply to an array of violence and persecution confronting Jews throughout their history in Europe, especially in the Russian empire. Still, while these events were also traumatic and deadly, they did not rise to the level of systematic and state-sponsored terror of Nazi Germany.
The coordination and planning was ""so special under national socialism [in Germany]"" and without comparison, Raphael Gross, the president of the German Historical Museum, told German public broadcaster DLF.
His fellow historian, Friedemann Bedürftig, told DLF that the term is a ""Verschlimmbesserung"" — a German word that means making something worse while trying to improve it.
How people and societies view and grapple with history changes over time, as does the vocabulary used to talk about it. That is especially true in Germany, whose present is constantly confronted by its past. Given the extremism of the Nazi era and the crimes against humanity that resulted, it may be impossible for historians, linguists and writers to ever settle on the right words to describe that scale of horror and destruction.
But the process of trying to do just that is itself another way in which Germany maintains public awareness of its history. In this regard, terms matter less than content.

https://www.dw.com/en/kashmir-a-pashtun-village-resisting-cultural-assimilation/a-67354852,POLITICS,Kashmir: A Pashtun village resisting cultural assimilation 09.11.2023,"Tucked away 80 kilometers (49.7 miles) from the bustling heart of Srinagar, Wantrag stands as a reflection of traditional Afghan life, where nearly 1,000 Pashto-speaking families fiercely uphold their cultural heritage.
The zigzag roads that weave through recently harvested paddy fields and bountiful apple orchards enter into Wantrag, perched majestically atop a hill in the Anantnag district in India-administered Kashmir.
Upon entering the village, a striking sight unfolds — houses line the banks of a water irrigation canal, walnut trees scattered throughout the landscape have transitioned to their autumn attire, and shop signs adorned with Pashto inscriptions. The air carries the shrill of autumn and aroma of Kabuli biryani — a dish consisting of steamed rice, caramelized carrots, raisins and marinated lamb. 
While women might not be immediately visible, men, both young and old, are seen toiling in the apple orchards.
Young boys play cricket on the winding roads while girls wearing headscarves hide behind walls.
The Pashtun community's reluctance to blend with the local Kashmiri population mirrors patterns seen in global diaspora.
""Preservation of any community's identity hinges on the conservation of its language and culture, and unfortunately, we are losing both,"" Bashir Ahmad Khan, a retired public school teacher and a Pashto activist, attired in a traditional Pathani outfit, told DW.
In the early 1920s, Khan's grandfather Noor Khaliq ventured into Kashmir from the Allai region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province in present-day Pakistan. Khaliq initially arrived for business but chose to stay, and now, his descendants form a major part of Wantrag.
He was one of the hundreds of Pashtuns who came to Kashmir for business in the early part of the 20th century and settled here. The descendants of those immigrants have carved out their lives, while resisting cultural assimilation.
The community has grappled with sentiments of political alienation and social exclusion, a simmering undercurrent that remains prevalent among senior male members who openly condemn the treatment they perceive as discriminatory by the successive governments of India-administered Kashmir.
""Pashto has been confined to being a spoken language here, with no locally-produced texts or encouragement for its promotion,"" Khan said, speaking with a deep-rooted concern for the preservation of his community's identity.
In 1953, the Pashto immigrants were granted citizenship followed by official recognition as one of the backward communities in India-administered Kashmir, a move to uplift the community economically and socially.
""Despite having a 12% reservation in government jobs... we had minimal representation in school graduates,"" Khan said.

The community received a major jolt after an Indian government-sponsored survey in 1986 categorized Pashtuns under the Gujjar community, creating a sense of injustice and erasing their distinct identity, Khan said.
And four years later, the Mandal Commission or the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Commission (SEBC) even dropped them out of the Gujjar community, leaving them without any recognition.
""Our struggle for recognition as a distinct community and reservation in jobs and university admissions will continue,"" Khan said.
The inception of Radio Kashmir in 1948 offered a platform for the Pashto language, featuring news and cultural programs. At that time, no other regional language was represented on Radio Kashmir, except for Pashto, Khan said. ""Unfortunately, our community was kept away from modern education resulting in the gradual disappearance of Pashto programs on radio and television,"" he added.
""Our space and representation were taken away from us,"" said Khan, blaming vested interests among the Other Backward Class (OBC) groups in Kashmir for obstructing Pashto from gaining a presence on radio and television. ""We used to have Pashto news and cultural programs on Radio Kashmir. But not anymore.""
Kashmiri Pashtuns, commonly referred to as Kashmiri Pathans, predominantly reside in the districts of Ganderbal, Baramulla, Anantnag, and Kishtwar, with a population of around 40,000.

Their cultural assimilation within the broader Kashmiri population has become evident, seen through the adoption of the traditional Kashmiri garment, the Pheran, and the acceptance of intermarriages. Yet, the Pashtun community perseveres in preserving distinctive aspects of their heritage, especially language, and food. A small booklet, first of its kind, was recently published to teach Pashto to children. Even tailors are strictly directed to only produce Pathan-style clothing.
""But today, we find ourselves more integrated into Kashmiri society rather than adhering to Afghan customs. As the Pheran culture gradually became part of our lives, we now require political support to preserve our traditions,"" Khan said.
Imbibing local Kashmiri culture while retaining certain Afghan traditions, the community finds itself at a crossroads, straddling the line between cultural adaptation and the preservation of their heritage.
Endogamous marriages were once the norm, keeping the Pashtun culture intact, but as inter-community marriages become more common, there is a growing concern that their cultural traditions may erode.
While their unique customs and traditional attire have endured over time, the Pashtun community's engagement with Kashmiri society has deepened, giving rise to a natural integration of cultures.
Yet, Khan harbors concerns about the inevitable and gradual integration of the Pashtun community into the majority Kashmiri population.
""Our kids speak Kashmiri now and community is opening up to marrying their children into Kashmiri families,"" said Khan, while acknowledging that, given the numerical disparity, the Kashmiri majority is bound to exert its cultural influence over time.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-remembers-nazi-pogroms-of-1938-amid-renewed-fears/a-67353063,POLITICS,Germany remembers Nazi pogroms of 1938 amid renewed fears 09.11.2023,"The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Josef Schuster, underlined the need for Jews in the country to be able to live freely and without fear.
His comments on Thursday came on the 85th anniversary of the Nazi November pogroms against Germany's Jews — and at a time when antisemitic incidents are once more on the rise.
Schuster acknowledged that Germany was committed to protecting Jewish life in stark contrast to the Nazi era.
However, he said the community did not want any ""protective shields.""
""We want to live freely in Germany, our country,"" he said.
""Anyone who wants to understand why the terrorist attack on Israel also causes deep trauma, fears and insecurity in the Jewish community in Germany stirs deep trauma, fears and insecurities, must be aware of what is happening in Jewish souls even 85 years after the pogrom night when, again, Stars of David are painted on Jewish homes and when Jewish ships are attacked again.""
Schuster's speech was part of a memorial event in the Beth Zion Synagogue in central Berlin, which itself was attacked in mid-October by would-be arsonists.
Among the guests present at the event were the German head of state, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and the president of Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, Bärbel Bas.

Germany has seen a sharp rise in antisemitism after Hamas' brutal attack that killed 1,400 people in Israel on October 7, which triggered an ongoing war in Gaza.
Chancellor Scholz also spoke at the memorial event and said he was ""ashamed and outraged"" at the recent wave of antisemitic incidents in Germany. He said every form of antisemitism was poisonous to society.
""It shouldn’t matter whether antisemitism is politically motivated or religious, whether it comes from comes from the left or from the right, whether it disguises itself as art or as scientific discourse, whether it has been here for centuries grew or came into the country from outside,"" Scholz emphasized.
He said the promise ""never again"" made by Germans after World War II meant the state had a duty to protect Jewish institutions and communities with the consistent enforcement of applicable law.
""We will prosecute anyone who supports terrorism, anyone who incites antisemitic agitation,"" Scholz said. ""We do not tolerate antisemitism.""
The November Pogroms of 1938 were previously known as Kristallnacht, or the Night of the Broken Glass, a reference to the shattered glass of the many Jewish-owned shops destroyed by the authorities. Those terms, however, are seldom used and regarded as minimizing the tragedy of the pogroms.
On the night, the Nazis killed at least 91 people and vandalized 7,500 Jewish businesses, burning more than 1,400 synagogues, according to Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.
Up to 30,000 Jewish men were arrested, and many were taken to concentration camps such as Dachau or Buchenwald.
Hundreds committed suicide or died because of mistreatment in the camps, years before the beginning of official mass deportations.
The event is seen as a turning point in the escalating persecution of Jews, which would eventually to the murder of 6 million European Jews by the Nazis and their supporters during the Holocaust.

https://www.dw.com/en/the-mystery-of-banksy-the-unauthorized-exhibition/a-67344109,ARTS,'The Mystery of Banksy': The unauthorized exhibition 09.11.2023,"Banksy: Even people who don't care about art have heard the name. The artist whose trademark is anonymity is also considered the creator of some of the most famous works of street art of all time. Consider the kissing policemen, the anarchist throwing a flower bouquet instead of a Molotov cocktail, or the little girl reaching for a red balloon that's floating away.
Spectacular actions like the self-shredding of an artwork right after it sold at auction for a large sum of money have gained Banksy a reputation as a kind of Robin Hood of the art world, a critically-thinking free spirit, a prankster.
It's much easier to see a Banksy work on a poster or on the artist's own Instagram account than to glimpse one out in the wild. Street art is, by definition, an ephemeral form of expression.
To get a picture of this busy artist's entire oeuvre, you would have to travel almost the entire world. Art experts say Banksy has been active in at least 20 countries over the last two decades — and not just in the artist's hometown of Bristol or in London, but also in hard-to-reach corners of the world, for example in Bethlehem and on the border with the Gaza Strip, where Banksy has been spray-painting since 2015 and has run a hotel near the barrier wall since 2017. Or in the destroyed suburbs of Kyiv, using the ruins of war for powerful expressions of solidarity.
But, in some cases, you can stay closer to home and simply go to a Banksy exhibition. As the artist's fame has grown, so have the efforts to place Banksy in a museum context. One exhibition was even authorized by Banksy — titled ""Cut & Run,"" which was held in Glasgow last summer and featured mostly the stencils used to create the iconic street art works. As Banksy described it, ""While the unauthorized Banksy shows may look like the sweepings from the floor of my studio, 'Cut & Run' actually is the sweepings from the floor of my studio.”
Following this logic, visitors to the unauthorized show entitled ""The Mystery of Banksy. A Genius Mind"" are not getting to see the actual ""studio sweepings.” But that's done nothing to diminish the popularity of the traveling exhibition, which has been touring Europe since 2021. It's currently being shown simultaneously in Stockholm, Hanover and Cologne, the exhibition's twentieth stop, where it's been on display since November 3.
According to the promoter — who usually books music stars like David Garrett on Germany's stages, or organizes newfangled ""immersive exhibitions"" about Tutankhamun or Salvador Dali — more than two million people have already visited the Banksy show. The agency says that in Cologne alone, 15,000 tickets were sold within a short time on the opening weekend.
The Cologne exhibition is being housed in an former car dealership, while in Hanover it is on display in a shuttered supermarket, helping to revitalize the city center. According to the curator of the show, Virginia Jean, ""Many visitors travel several hours to see a Banksy exhibition,"" despite the fact that the exhibition does not feature a single Banksy original.
""We deliberately avoid using originals,"" says Jean. ""We don't see our project as a Banksy exhibition, but as a tribute to this artist."" A team of thirty people, including specialist installers, electricians and six professional graffiti artists, set up the exhibition in the empty space in just ten days — a masterpiece in itself.
Visitors get to see quite a bit for their €20 ($21.35) entrance fee: nearly 200 works ranging from street art, sculptures, videos and installations are displayed across some 400 square meters (4,306 sq. feet).
Some of Banksy's most spectacular installations are recreated in fifteen rooms, such as ""The Elephant in the Room."" The animal, decorated with wallpaper patterns, once stood in the middle of a Los Angeles gallery, in a replica 1950-era living room, highlighting poverty and injustice in the world. At the opening, there was a real elephant in the room, as well as a real Angelina Jolie — and maybe even a real Banksy, who knows?
The Cologne show has a room that's meant to depict the artist's studio, featuring a hoodie-clad figure sitting at a table. This tableau was probably copied from one of the exhibition rooms of the authorized show in Glasgow. So it's possibly how Banksy's studio actually looks.
But what does Banksy himself think of commercial projects like this? Does he not care? Is he outraged and only unable to protest because doing otherwise would risk his anonymity? Or is this kind of fairground Banksy show a new prank by the inventive artist?
Fittingly, the organizers want to neither confirm nor deny such speculation. All they will say is that they are in contact with the managers of the ""Banksy"" brand.
And they're directing a portion of the profits to the Banksy Foundation, to finance, among other things, the Louise Michel rescue boat. Named after the French anarchist Michel, the 30-meter (98-foot) former yacht and its crew of ten have been rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean since 2020.

https://www.dw.com/en/nazi-brutality-the-november-9-1938-pogroms/a-46215163,CULTURE,"Nazi brutality: the November 9, 1938 pogroms 08.11.2023","""I can still clearly remember the morning of November 10,"" said W. Michael Blumenthal. ""My father was arrested early in the morning. Amid the commotion and despite the fact that my mother had forbidden me to do so, I went outside without being noticed. I saw the broken shop windows on Kufürstendamm boulevard and smoke coming out of the synagogue on Fasanen Strasse.""
Blumenthal was only 12 years old at the time. 

On the night of November 9, 1938, Jews throughout Germany and Austria were the victims of riots: 1,300 synagogues and 7,500 businesses were destroyed and countless Jewish cemeteries and schools were vandalized.
The police watched as Jews were humiliated in the street, beaten, and in at least 91 cases, murdered. The local fire departments did not stop the synagogues and Jewish shops from burning; they merely prevented the flames from spreading to neighboring buildings.
And that was only the beginning. On November 10, approximately 30,000 Jewish men were taken to the concentration camps in Dachau, Sachsenhausen or Buchenwald.
W. Michael Blumenthal's father was among them.
""I still remember my mother's words when he was taken away by two policemen: 'What's going on, what are you doing with him, what has he done, where is he being taken to?' Even as a 12-year-old, you can feel the fear of adults.""
The rest of W. Michael Blumenthal's family managed to flee to Shanghai in 1939. It was one of the only places at that time that still allowed Jewish refugees to come in without a visa. Blumenthal wrote about the experience in his memoir, From Exile to Washington: A Memoir of Leadership in the Twentieth Century, 2014. 
Physical attacks and intimidation targeting Jews was already widespread in Germany ever since the Nazis seized power in 1933.
The Nuremberg Laws established in 1935 defined who was to be considered a Jew, and many people suddenly faced a professional ban. Other laws restricted their access to public spaces. Many Jewish properties were expropriated to be ""aryanized.""
Yet, ""it is important to understand November 1938 as a turning point in history,"" said historian Raphael Gross, president of the Deutsches Historisches Museum (German Historical Museum) in Berlin. ""After 1938, what is known as the epoch of German Jewry was over. German society was different afterwards.""
The pretext the Nazis needed to justify the pogrom came when a Jewish teenager, Herschel Grynszpan, assassinated the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath on November 7 in Paris.
Immediately after German radio reported about the crime, anti-Jewish riots broke out in some German cities. However, systematic riots began throughout Germany two days later — after Hitler personally gave the order.
From Munich, where the entire Nazi leadership had gathered for the anniversary of the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, the Nazi Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, wrote a speech in which he decreed that Jewish businesses should be destroyed and that synagogues be set on fire. Police were instructed not to interfere with the riots, and firefighters were only to protect ""Aryan"" property. Looting was prohibited.
The orders were applied that very night, not only in Berlin, but also in Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt, as well as in small towns and villages throughout Germany. ""For different reasons, Germans either participated or looked away,"" said Blumenthal. Not everyone agreed with what had happened, but ""many just sheepishly watched in silence.""
""The November 1938 pogrom was carried out in plain sight; it could be seen by everyone — by the press of the world, foreign diplomats and all citizens,"" pointed out historian Raphael Gross.
Despite the official interdiction, looting also took place on November 9 and 10. One report by the Brazilian Embassy Counselor mentions gangs of young people showing objects of worship stolen from synagogues.
All diplomats stationed in Germany informed their home countries about the incidents. The reports described the events as ""cultural barbarism,"" said historian Hermann Simon, who was the director of the Centrum Judaicum for 27 years up until 2015. Simon collected reports written by diplomats from 20 countries who were stationed in Germany in 1938.
For example, the Polish Consul General in Leipzig described the fate of the Polish Sperling family: ""Sperling's wife was stripped naked and thugs tried to rape her.""
The Latvian ambassador wrote: ""Kurfürstendamm looked like a battlefield."" The Finnish representative noted ""devastating criticism"" from the population. ""I am ashamed to be a German,"" was a very common statement among the public, the report stated.

The diplomats however did not send concrete demands or proposals for action to their home governments. ""They were waiting and deceptively hoping that they could somehow come to terms with the Nazi regime,"" said Hermann Simon. ""In that respect, the response to the reports was relatively low.""
There were at least some international reactions, according to Raphael Gross: ""The Kindertransport program to England began in the wake of November 1938. Some states did react, but it was far too little.""
The fact that the Nazis were planning to murder all the Jews in the world was not foreseeable at the time, according to Gross.
The Italian embassy wrote on November 16, 1938: ""It is not conceivable that one day 500,000 people [the approximate number of Jews living in Germany] will be sent to a wall, sentenced to execution or suicide, or that they will be locked into huge concentration camps.""
A fatal misjudgment of the situation.

https://www.dw.com/en/eu-australia-trade-talks-what-can-we-learn-from-the-failure/a-67333414,BUSINESS,EU-Australia trade talks: What can we learn from the failure? 07.11.2023,"Since mid-2018, the European Union (EU) and Australia have been negotiating an agreement aimed at facilitating and expanding trade. The ""preliminary termination"" of the talks at the end of October came as a surprise to the EU.
An EU trade official told German business daily Handelsblatt that Brussels was in a ""state of shock."" German Finance Minister Christian Lindner expressed his frustration, saying, ""If we can't make progress even with Australia — a liberal democracy firmly rooted in the Western world — that is concerning.""
The Europeans had placed great hope in an agreement with Australia for several reasons. In a world increasingly marked by conflicts, isolationism and protectionism, free trade agreements are seen as symbols that a different approach is possible.
In addition to the lofty goal of preserving a liberal world trade order, the EU was also naturally interested in Australia's wealth of raw materials.
The continent's deposits of rare earths, for example, could have reduced Europe's dependence on China, while green hydrogen from Australia could have helped the EU to transform its traffic sector. Europe's carmakers also hoped for a bigger market share.
In exchange for that, Australia sought larger EU market access for its agricultural products, especially for the grains and beef that make up a significant bulk of Australian exports.
The EU is Australia's third most important trading partner after China and Japan. But Australia ranks only 18th for the EU. In 2022, bilateral trade had a volume of approximately €56 billion ($59.7 billion) for goods and €26 billion for services.
The negotiations failed primarily due to disagreements over agriculture. The EU had reportedly offered to allow Australian agricultural products worth approximately €600 million annually into the European market. Australia considered this inadequate.
Holger Görg, an international trade expert at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW), can understand why Australia rejected the deal. ""The EU imported agricultural products worth about €200 billion in 2022. The offer to Australia accounts for around 0.3% of total EU agricultural imports,"" Görg told DW, adding that the improvement under the accord would have amounted to not more than just half of what Australia currently exports to the EU.
Another point of contention was the EU's  protected designation of origin (PDO) policy under which all parts of the production, processing and preparation process of branded agricultural products must take place in the specific region.
Product names such as Parma ham, feta cheese, champagne or even Prosecco are protected in the EU, but not in Australia, said Görg. ""In Australia, labeling regulation is being handled more loosely, and there are Australian alternatives with similar names for many EU products.""
Evgeny Postnikov of the University of Melbourne says Australian farmers consider the EU's PDO policy as unfair, which is why talks on the issue didn't make progress. ""The usage of these names in Australia is an indication of the success of European farmers who migrated here and brought these products, demonstrating their lasting popularity,"" he told DW.
Postnikov thinks Australian farmers drove a hard bargain in the talks because they are in ""a good bargaining position.""
""A deal with the EU would have been a bonus, but is not existential for its [Australia's farming sector's ] global competitiveness,"" he said. Unlike EU farmers their Australian counterparts are not pampered by heavy state subsidies. They are much more competitive on international markets as big as China.
In both the EU and Australia, farmers wield huge political influence, says Markus Wagner, and their lobbies were ""not willing to make a compromise."" The associate professor and expert in economic law at the University of Wollongong in Sydney told DW that groundbreaking new projects also foundered in the wake.
""The lobby for green energy sources was not strong enough to break this resistance, even though it would have been strategically beneficial,"" Wagner said.
In addition, there were political constraints in both Canberra and Brussels.
In a national referendum Australians overwhelmingly rejected a government  proposal to recognize Indigenous Australians in the constitution, with the biggest opposition having come from rural voters. ""The Labor government cannot afford to alienate this constituency, especially ahead of general elections in 2025,"" said Wagner.
And officials in Brussels fear that any far-reaching concessions to foreign farmers might upset EU farmers and swell the already-growing ranks of populist parties ahead of EU parliamentary elections next year.
The failed negotiations with Australia overshadow a free trade agreement between the EU and New Zealand, successfully completed and signed earlier this year.
Postnikov thinks a trade deal with much-bigger Australia would have put the EU and all other global free trade efforts in good stead.
""This does not augur well for the rules-based trade which both parties wish to promote in the face of growing protectionism in the US and elsewhere,"" he said. The failure would send a signal around that the world may have reached ""the pinnacle of trade liberalization,"" and other countries, ""particularly in the Global South, will be watching closely.""
According to Australia's Minister of Agriculture, Murray Watt, bilateral trade negotiations with the EU are ""unlikely"" to resume before next election in 2025.
Agriculture policy also plays a significant role in the planned free trade agreement between the EU and the South American trade bloc Mercosur comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.
The trade pact was already reached in 2019 after two decades of negotiations, but has been on hold due to EU environmental concerns. Brussels presented Mercosur with an addendum to the agreement that included environmental safeguards to address reservations by many EU member states. Brazil, which currently holds the presidency of Mercosur, called the additions protectionist and pushed back against more open government procurement provided for in the proposed trade deal.

Holger Görg thinks both parties to the trade talks should change their priorities ""given the current situation, where trade is being reconsidered to avoid dependencies."" especially on raw materials, priorities in trade agreements should be reconsidered.""
Especially in the EU, were agriculture accounts for only one to two percent of economic output, it should be ""possible to consider opening up the sector for the  benefit of other sectors, particularly raw material imports,"" he said.
Wollongong University's Wagner agrees and thinks pressure from farming lobbies will also be ""high"" in the context of Mercosur. ""Given the challenging geopolitical situation, it remains to be seen whether the EU can look beyond purely economic interests.""

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-court-denies-patients-right-to-suicide-drug/a-67332400,LAW AND JUSTICE,Germany: Court denies patients right to suicide drug 07.11.2023,"Germany's Federal Administrative Court on Tuesday ruled that individuals who wish to end their lives have no right to acquire a deadly dose of narcotics to administer themselves.
German law on assisted dying is a gray area, and the two men had asked to acquire lethal doses of sodium-pentobarbital to be used at their homes.
The two plaintiffs — one seriously ill with the after-effects of cancer and the other with multiple sclerosis  — had applied to the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) for permission to buy sodium pentobarbital.
The drug is a powerful sedative and it can be lethal in high doses, being the preferred drug for judicial executions in many US states.
Both men had said they wanted to be able to end their lives at home, with their families, and without the help of a doctor.
However, the BfArM rejected the application, and both men unsuccessfully challenged the ruling in lower courts.
In the legal decision on Tuesday, the court in Leipzig agreed with the earlier rulings.
It agreed that denying the men access to the drug interfered with their right to a self-determined death, which includes the freedom to take one's own life as well as the right to seek and use voluntarily offered help to do so.
While that right is enshrined in German law, the judges said the other public interests such as safety outweighed it. The court added that there was a ""realistic possibility"" of obtaining lethal doses of drugs via a doctor willing to help of their own volition and not on a business basis.

""For people who have made a self-determined decision to end their life, there are other reasonable options for realizing their wish to die,"" the court said in a statement.
""The dangers that can arise from the purchase of sodium pentobarbital and the storage of the drug by those wishing to die are great. In view of these dangers and the existing alternatives to using the desired means, there is no objection to the fact that the law does not allow its acquisition for the purpose of suicide.""
The two men's lawyer, Robert Rossruch, said they would appeal the ruling to Germany's Federal Constitutional Court.
""This is a black day for the two plaintiffs and a black day for all people in Germany who had hoped to be able to commit suicide with sodium pentobarbital to end their suffering,"" he said.
Active assistance — physically taking an individual's life for them — is banned in Germany, but the law is less clear around supplying passive help, such as providing deadly medication for them to take themselves.
The issue raises particular sensitivities in the country, where more than 200,000 people with disabilities were murdered by the Nazis under a program of euthanasia.

https://www.dw.com/en/wework-bankruptcy-whats-next-for-coworking-office-spaces/a-67333529,BUSINESS,WeWork bankruptcy: What's next for coworking office spaces 07.11.2023,"WeWork, the US firm that pioneered the coworking office-spaces trend, sought bankruptcy protection in the US on Monday, marking a spectacular rise — and fall — of a firm that revolutionized flexible working in the last decade.
The Japanese SoftBank Group-backed startup, which rented sleek shared office spaces to startups and freelancers, said the move was part of a ""comprehensive reorganization"" to shore up its finances.
The bankruptcy caps years of troubles at the debt-ridden firm that posted huge losses on the billions of dollars it spent aggressively on leasing shared office spaces in locations such as San Fransisco, Tel Aviv and London.
WeWork said about 92% of the company's lenders had agreed to a restructuring plan that would see them convert their secured debt into equity. The debt conversion would wipe out about $3 billion (€2.8 billion) of debt from its debt pile of more than $18 billion, news agency Reuters reported. The plan will also help WeWork reduce its portfolio of office leases.
""As part of today's filing, WeWork is requesting the ability to reject the leases of certain locations, which are largely nonoperational, and all affected members have received advanced notice,"" the company said in a statement.
The company currently leases millions of square feet of office space in about 700 locations in dozens of countries, including Germany.
The bankruptcy will only affect WeWork's business in the US and Canada.
Not long ago, WeWork — co-founded by Adam Neumann — was a darling of investors, attracting backing from the likes of SoftBank and JPMorgan Chase, and growing to become the most valuable US startup worth $47 billion.
The company pursued breakneck expansion, even while burning massive amounts of cash, becoming a coworking leader offering spaces where different teams, companies and individuals could work together and share facilities and services.
In need of cash, the company planned to go public in 2019. However, the initial public offering was shelved amid governance issues at the firm and poor financials, leading to Neumann's ouster.
SoftBank came to WeWork's rescue and took it public at an $8 billion valuation. But then the COVID-19 pandemic added to the firm's troubles, hitting demand for shared office spaces as many workers were forced to work from home.
WeWork's prospects further dimmed as a global economic slowdown and high inflation prompted many of its startup customers to close their doors.
WeWork's valuation has tanked from its previous highs with the company valued at less than $45 million as of Friday.
Former CEO Neumann said WeWork's bankruptcy filing was ""disappointing.""
""It has been challenging for me to watch from the sidelines since 2019 as WeWork has failed to take advantage of a product that is more relevant today than ever before,"" Neumann said in a statement to CNBC.
WeWork's bankruptcy filing comes as leasing demand for office space remains weak overall. Even as companies are increasingly insisting people return to the office, at least partially, vacancies in office space remain high.
Tobias Kollewe, president of Germany's Federal Association of Coworking Spaces (BVCS), says WeWork is a clear case of mismanagement. It cannot be down to the situation in the industry.
""Coworking is a success story,"" Kollewe told DW.
Industry surveys show an improvement in the demand for short-term office rentals as firms warm up to the reality of hybrid working.
A June survey of European companies by CBRE, a global commercial real estate services & investment company, showed that ""appetite for flex space continues to rise,"" with some firms prepared to consider higher allocations of flex office space than has been the case in the past.
Earlier this year, research firm Market Reports World put the size of the coworking space market at $14 billion and forecast it to grow at a compound annual growth rate of more than 17% until 2028.
Mark Dixon, founder of WeWork's rival IWG said hybrid work was accelerating the company's growth around the world.
""Today, we are continuing to witness the unprecedented rise of the Great Lease Resignation. Businesses of all sizes are terminating their long-term commercial office leases and replacing them with shorter-term agreements with flexible-workspace providers like IWG,"" Dixon said in a statement in October.
The company, which has nearly 3,500 locations in more than 120 countries, posted its highest-ever quarterly revenue on Tuesday.

The number of coworking spaces in the US rose by 10% in the second quarter of 2023 versus the first quarter, according to researchers at CoworkingCafe.
In Germany, Kollewe says the number of coworking spaces is on the rise, adding that he expects the demand to increase.
""GenZ in particular no longer wants to change their place of residence for a job,"" said Kollewe. ""Working from home at the kitchen table or the living room table — that can't be a permanent solution.""

https://www.dw.com/en/report-saudi-arabia-atp-talks-could-change-mens-tennis/a-67331699,SPORTS,Report: Saudi Arabia-ATP talks could change men's tennis 07.11.2023,"The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP)  is reportedly in discussions with Saudi Arabia to engineer a dramatic change to the start of the men's tennis season.
According to British newspaper, The Times, Saudi Arabia is keen to host a new Masters 1000 tournament just a week before the Australian Open. It would likely have a profound impact on the first Grand Slam of the year.
Masters series events are considered the second-most important tier of tournaments behind theGrand Slam  majors. A new January Masters event would undoubtedly see warm-up tournaments in Australia lose most of the top names in men's tennis, and much of their ability to draw fans as a result.
If confirmed, the tournament would push the top men's players into an event in Riyadh that would finish just eight days before the start of the major in Melbourne, 12,000 kilometers and eight time zones away.
The ATP tour schedule is already a full 11 months, kicking off with the United Cup, a combined men's and women's team event in Australia before leading up to the late January start of the Australian Open.
But a proposed investment from Saudi Arabia ""would be worth hundreds of millions of pounds"", reports The Times, with the Riyadh tournament suggested to start in January 2025. 
Saudi Arabia""s Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth fund which has invested heavily in numerous professional sports including football, golf, Formula One, boxing and cricket, has also got previous history with tennis.
Tennis great Billie Jean King said she expects the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) to give in to Saudi offers but hopes the WTA will push for social change as part of its dealmaking.
After a much-criticized WTA Finals recently wrapped up in Cancun, Mexico, talk is said to have stepped up regarding moving the finals to Saudi Arabia in coming years. The WTA Finals is the most significant event in the women's game outside of the four majors.
WTA CEO Steve Simon has said that Saudi Arabia presented ""big issues"" as a host for women's tour events, because Saudi Arabia's record on women's and LGBTQ rights has led to accusations of sportswashing — that is, money spent on sports teams, athletes and events that is meant to distract attention from Saudi Arabia's human rights abuses. 
The ATP has declined to comment on the reports by The Times, but chairman Andrea Gaudenzi confirmed he held ""positive” discussions with Saudi officials this year about a partnership.
The ATP's end-of-season Next Gen Finals tournament for players aged 21 and under is set for next month in Jeddah, and is part of a deal that will run for five years. The Times also reports that ATP and Saudi representatives will meet at next week's ATP Finals in Turin.

https://www.dw.com/en/bulgaria-who-is-vassil-terziev-sofias-new-mayor/a-67328589,POLITICS,"Bulgaria: Who is Vassil Terziev, Sofia's new mayor? 07.11.2023","Bulgaria's capital, Sofia, has a new mayor. Vassil Terziev is successful, modern and pro-European.
He has promised to transform the city and tackle the problems that have been plaguing it for years, such as poor air quality, corruption and stagnating public projects.
His critics highlight his lack of experience in both politics and urban planning. But such criticism is like water off a duck's back: Terziev is convinced that his background as an entrepreneur and investor will help him do a better job than his predecessor, Yordanka Fandakova, who was mayor of Sofia for 14 years.
But what motivated the 45-year-old, whose IT company, Telerik, was sold for the record sum of $262.5 million (€245.2 million) in 2014, to move into politics?
""I firmly believe that successful people should give something back to society,"" he said in his first TV interview as mayoral candidate in June 2023. After winning the election in Sofia on Sunday with 48.2% of the vote, he now has the opportunity to do just that.
Terziev was born in Sofia in 1978. His grandfather and both his parents worked in the Bulgarian secret service during the communist era — a fact that quickly became a focal point of the election campaign after Terziev announced his candidacy.
His family's communist past was particularly relevant because the alliance that nominated him included a range of pro-democratic, pro-European parties and organizations such as the We Continue the Change (PP) party of former prime minister Kiril Petkov, Democratic Bulgaria (DB) and Save Sofia.
One of the electoral pledges of Save Sofia was to dismantle the Monument to the Soviet Army in the capital. The monument, which was erected in 1954, has been a bone of contention in Sofia since the collapse of the communist regime in 1989.
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, however, it has also become a symbol of the divisions within Bulgarian society, which were apparent throughout the election campaign.
Vanya Grigorova was the other candidate in the election run-off on November 5. The prominent trade unionist pledged to exclude private companies from the provision of local services such as water and public lighting if she won.
Her refusal to condemn Russia's war on Ukraine and her passionate calls for a restoration of Russian gas supplies to Bulgaria led her critics to call her ""the voice of the Kremlin.""
She was also the voice of those Bulgarians who sympathize with Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which — according to opinion polls — is about a quarter of the population.
Grigorova was backed by a range of pro-Russian parties and is considered a close ally of President Rumen Radev, who is fiercely opposed to Bulgarian military aid for Ukraine.
""We cannot allow Putin to conquer our capital,"" said former president Rosen Plevneliev just two days before the poll.
The race between Terziev and Grigorova was unexpectedly close. In the end, she got 46.9% of the vote, finishing just 1.3 percentage points behind Terziev.
Terziev's critics say that the son of a member of the communist apparatus cannot be a real pro-European alternative. Terziev disagrees, arguing that the time has come to look to the future.
""The more we look to the past and find opportunities for division, the more our focus shifts away from the way things should be,"" he told DW in August. ""At a recent meeting with citizens, I said that whether Communist or anti-Communist, we all breathe the same air, drive on the same poor roads and suffer from the same problems.""
He also stressed that his success had nothing to do with his family's networks. ""With me, there is none of what people see as privilege. My academic success was entirely my own. We built up our business with money from clients,"" Terziev told DW.
Terziev's successes are certainly considerable. He and three friends founded the IT company Telerik in 2002. Twelve years later, they sold it for $262.5 million to the American company Progress Software — a record for the Bulgarian tech sector at the time.
Since then, Terziev and his partners have founded the Telerik Academy, which trains software and IT experts. Terziev himself has invested in over 100 Bulgarian startups.
The challenges he faces as mayor of Sofia are no less considerable: He now assumes responsibility for a city with a budget of over 2.5 billion leva (€1.28 billion/$1.37 billion) and a long list of knotty problems ranging from inadequate public transport and poor air quality to a lack of vision for urban development in the city.
""My dream is to have the longest pedestrian zone in Europe — for pedestrians, cyclists and motor scooters,"" he told DW.
If he is to implement his ideas, however, he will need support in the city council. He has only two options in this respect. Firstly, to seek the support of the former ruling party, GERB (the conservative Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria), which ruled Sofia for 18 years. During the campaign, Terziev and his team said that GERB was their main rival.
The only other possible source of support would be the pro-Russian coalition that backed Grigorova.
Over the summer, the parties that nominated Terziev were forced to work with GERB to form a government after Bulgaria's parliamentary election to stem the influence of the pro-Russian bloc — even though some of these parties were established with the specific aim of driving GERB from power.
It would appear that Sofia's new mayor now has no choice but to work with GERB to keep pro-Russian forces in check.

https://www.dw.com/en/judge-to-trump-this-is-a-courtroom-not-a-political-rally/a-67322515,CRIME,"Judge to Trump: This is 'a courtroom, not a political rally' 06.11.2023","Donald Trump, the former president of the United States, appeared in a New York courthouse today, where he took the witness stand in a massive fraud case against him, his sons and their family business.
The case, brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, accuses the Trumps of having manipulated the value of their real estate properties by millions of dollars to suit their needs — inflating values when it came to securing loans, and deflating them when it came to paying taxes.
Trump, who is currently devastating his competitors in the race to become the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, spoke to reporters upon arrival Monday, decrying the New York fraud case as ""election interference.""
Inside the courtroom, Trump faced questioning from Judge Arthur Engoron about business practices for which Engoron has already found him guilty.
Engoron upbraided Trump several times throughout his appearance, telling him: ""We don't have time to waste. We have one day to do this,"" and calling his answers, ""non-responsive"" and ""repetitive.""
Trump, who attacked the judge before his testimony — saying, ""It's all political warfare as you would call it, or political lawfare"" — continued to do so on the witness stand, staring at Engoron and saying ""he always rules against me.""
The judge replied, ""You can attack me whichever way you want but please answer the question.""
At one point, Engeron — who has twice fined the politician for making defamatory remarks about court staff — appealed to Trump's lawyers, asking: ""can you control your client? This is not a political rally, this is a courtroom.""

The fraud trial threatens to be costly for Trump — a $250 million (€233 million) fine looms — and could bar him from doing business in New York, but unlike the four criminal cases he currently faces, there is no threat of a prison sentence.
Though Trump has not been required to appear in court until now, he has done so consistently since the trial began in early October.
He has used the media attention on him and his legal troubles as an avenue to vent grievances and malign the US legal system. All the while, the presidential candidate is raking in cash by using his legal woes as a vehicle for soliciting campaign donations under the motto of fighting for his supporters' right to free speech.
Trump has used his default ""greatest witch hunt of all time"" defense in the court of public opinion and called New York Attorney General James, a Black woman, ""out of control.""
James appeared unimpressed by Trump's distracting antics Monday, saying: ""At the end of the day, the only thing that matters are the facts and the numbers. And the numbers, my friends, don't lie.""
Though Trump has claimed no one was injured as a result of his business practices, New York attorneys claim his falsified records likely earned him as much as $100 million dollars and inflated his personal wealth by $2 billion.
Michael Cohen, a former lawyer and so-called ""fixer"" for Trump, testified in late October that Trump would usually provide the number he wanted to use in a given situation and that it was up to everyone else to ""reverse engineer"" accounts to ensure they came out to that number.
Cohen himself served time for violating campaign finance laws by making secret payments to hide news of an extramarital affair that threatened Trump's 2016 presidential candidacy.
Trump's sons each denied responsibility for any wrongdoing when testifying on the decades long accounting scheme last week, saying the company's accountants were to blame.
On Monday, Donald Trump himself said: ""All I did was authorize and tell people to give whatever is necessary for the accountants to do the statements. I would look at them, I would see them, and maybe on some occasions, I would have some suggestions.""
Trump also insisted he bears no responsibility to banks because his financial statements all carried a disclaimer that said they were worthless and should not be trusted.

https://www.dw.com/en/travelers-with-disabilities-face-accessibility-issues-in-germany/a-67010173,TRAVEL,Travelers with disabilities face accessibility issues in Germany 06.11.2023,"Traveling in Germany when disabled is not easy. Bernhard Endres, a wheelchair user, knows this from his own experience. ""When I plan a vacation, I have to search a long time until I find something suitable,"" he says.
Often, he says, it's difficult to find information about structural barriers in a hotel or vacation home, for example. Many tell him their establishments are barrier-free, though once he arrives it often turns out not to be true at all. The wheelchair may not fit in the bathroom or there may be a step somewhere.
Endres is a member of the tourism specialist team of the German National Association of Self-Help for the Physically Disabled and is therefore very knowledgeable about accessibility issues within Germany's tourism industry.
""The situation is not ideal and that's putting it nicely,"" Endres tells DW. Jonas Fischer, accessibility officer at the association Barrierefreiheit beim Sozialverband (VdK), an association that promotes accessability, agrees. ""We're a long way from having nationwide accessible tourism infrastructure in Germany."" This results in major restrictions for people with disabilities who want to travel around the country.
The fact that more considerations are made for people with mobility related impairments, as opposed to other types of disabilities, is due to the high costs involved in adapting a space, says Fischer. Fischer also points out that many museums, amusement parks and other facilities do not follow the two-senses principle, which increases accessibility in that information should be conveyed and perceivable via at least two senses (for example, visual and auditory). The VdK, which advocates for accessibility, believes both public and private facilities should be required to be accessible. In the US, this has long been the case.
One of the biggest hurdles for travelers with disabilities is the lack of reliable information about how accessible a travel destination is, which makes it challenging to plan a vacation. In an attempt to remedy this situation, Germany introduced a ""Tourism for All"" labeling system for travel options in 2011. It was developed with the help of Germany's ministry of economic affairs and energy.
Any organization or institution listed in the ""Tourism for All"" database has been verified by independent investigators and certified. On the website, which is also available in English, one can view tourism-related offers which offer different levels of accessibility. Although not all listings are entirely barrier-free, they have all undergone a strict certification procedure.

By using the database, one can learn, for example, that the pavement around the Brandenburg Gate has a slope of 1% at a certain point, and that guided tours for blind or visually impaired people are available at Naumburg Cathedral. One can also find, for example, the exact dimensions of the public bathroom in the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz. The site also includes detailed information on hotels, campsites, restaurants, shops, beaches and more.
But there's a catch. The database currently includes just 2,828 facilities, locations and businesses in Germany. According to an estimate by the Federal Association of the German Tourism Industry, the total number of tourism-relevant properties in Germany is somewhere between 200,000 and 250,000. The lack of entries could have something to do with the fact that certification costs a fee and must be renewed every three years.
Travelers with disabilities in Germany, therefore, have few choices but to take matters into their own hands and search for accessibility information related to a sight or tourist accommodation on their own. Some popular locations do provide information, like Cologne Cathedral or Neuschwanstein castle, for example. Both list the most important information on their respective websites, although not in as much detail as on the ""Tourism for All"" database.
The German National Tourist Board, which markets Germany as a destination internationally, also stresses the importance of making accessibility related offerings more visible. They aim to position Germany as an inclusive destination that enables all people to actively participate in tourism. The German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA) agrees.
""It is part of the DNA of hoteliers and restaurateurs to be the best possible hosts for all guests. Of course, this also applies to guests with disabilities,"" says Sandra Warden, managing director at DEHOGA.
""The importance of accessibility has therefore grown in recent years and is being considered when constructing new buildings,"" says Warden. Yet it can be much more complicated to make existing buildings accessible due to cost-related factors. For example, wheelchair-accessible rooms require significantly more space than conventional rooms.
At least at German airports, passengers with disabilities know what to expect. According to EU law, there is a right to free assistance during check-in, boarding and disembarkation. Most of Germany's major train stations also offer assistance to travelers with disabilities. However, according to the VdK, in 2020 the platforms of around 22% of Germany's 5,400 train stations were still not accessible to those with disabilities.

https://www.dw.com/en/south-africa-faces-growing-xenophobia-problem/a-67305882,POLITICS,South Africa faces growing xenophobia problem 04.11.2023,"The self-appointed civilian army patrolling the streets in South Africa's Soweto Township had one aim only: To drive out foreigners. A mob made up of people supporting the anti-immigrant group Operation Dudula stormed into so-called Spaza shops run by foreigners in the village of Diepkloof, where they harassed owners — inspecting the sell-by dates on their products and threatening to close the shops.
Victress Mathuthu, who is from Zimbabwe, was one of those targeted by xenophobic Black South Africans. ""If the members of Operation Dudula are dissatisfied with foreign nationals being granted licenses to run small businesses, they should address the government or the relevant ministry.
Operation Dudula supporters have claimed that relevant ministries are not doing enough to stop foreigners from owning businesses, using this as justification for taking the law into their own hands.
""They are not allowed to own a Spaza shop,"" claims Thabo Ngayo during one such vigilante operation. Dudula's national coordinator, Ngayo said the businesses are reserved solely for South Africans, before telling the shop owner, ""That means this Spaza shop must belong to a South African. You have a few days to vacate the premises."" The same goes for foreign owners who have registered their businesses the Dudula leader said.
Mzwanele Manyi, a representative of the Economic Freedom Fighters party, agrees. He, too, is calling for the closure of all foreign-owned Spaza shops in South Africa. ""We simply cannot tolerate such a situation,"" Manyi told DW.
Xenophobia is nothing new in South Africa. In April 2022, a Zimbabwean in Diepsloot, north of Johannesburg, was stoned and set on fire. In 2008, Black South Africans torched huts belonging to foreigners in their townships, killing 62 people. The outrage sparked by the wave of hate killings was widespread, yet investigations started by initiatives at the time went nowhere.
The platform Xenowatch, which was developed by the African Center for Migration and Society (ACMS) at the University of Witwatersrand, collects data on crimes against foreigners. They recorded 1,038 attacks on migrants, 661 deaths and 5,131 shops looted since 1994. Xenowatch says this is almost certainly an underestimation, as not every case is reported.
The group Operation Dudula first appeared on social media in 2020. Dudula is a Zulu word meaning ""push back."" The group is now registered as a political party and will take part in the country's 2024 general election.
But Dudula candidates won't be the only ones chanting xenophobic slogans on the campaign trail. The Economic Freedom Fighters, currently South Africa's third-strongest party, also uses them. Though the party takes a radical leftist approach to the economy, it is also openly xenophobic. 
Other smaller parties, such as the Patriotic Alliance and ActionSA, have also inciting against foreigners. The latter was able to score points with xenophobic sloganeering during last year's municipal elections.

That is a threatening development from Fredson Guilengue's perspective. A staff member at the German Left Party-aligned Rosa Luxemburg Foundation in Johannesburg, Guilengue fears an uptick in attacks on migrants in South Africa — as well as the continuing growth of the country's right-wing scene — as the vote approaches.
Guilengue, from neighboring Mozambique, says even if current data shows a drop in the number of actual xenophobic attacks compared to 2022, the narrative scapegoating of migrants is growing. ""Unlike past waves, what we are seeing now is the institutionalization of xenophobia,"" he told DW, noting that Operation Dudula was contributing to the phenomenon.
Guilengue says the problems Black South Africans have with people from elsewhere in Africa come down to a combination of factors. ""First, colonialism and Apartheid not only led to a split between whites and Blacks but also to a split within the Black majority — putting immigrants on the bottom rung of Black South African society.""
Now, in a desolate economy lacking in job opportunities and at a time when political parties are pushing xenophobic policies, this Apartheid- era inheritance has grown more explosive.
Staff at the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation fear that the perennially ruling African National Congress (ANC) party could also jump on the xenophobia bandwagon. There are xenophobic forces in the ANC and Nelson Mandela's former freedom-fighting movement is looking at the most difficult vote in its history. Experts predict the ANC may even fall below the 50% mark for the first time since it was established.
A study from the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) in Pretoria says every second person in South Africa is unemployed, and blame for increasing poverty, extreme social injustice, corruption and crime is often pinned on foreigners.  
In truth, says the ISS, it is poor governance and corruption in politics, combined with administrative deficiencies, that are to blame. Furthermore, South Africa's migrant population, estimated at 6.5%, is no larger than anywhere else in the world.
The fact that many foreigners living in South Africa do not have proper residency permits is also the result of poor immigration policy. Many foreigners migrate to South Africa legally only to have their status later revoked through no fault of their own, say ISS researchers. They point out that the country's Interior Ministry has been plagued by corruption for years and is also way behind when it comes to processing residency applications and permits.

https://www.dw.com/en/israel-hamas-war-strains-ties-with-turkey/a-67302382,CONFLICTS,Israel-Hamas war strains ties with Turkey 04.11.2023,"As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met in New York in mid-September, the atmosphere was markedly friendly. The two leaders spoke of improving bilateral relations, and joked about their good ""ties"" — a pun referencing their matching red neckties. 
Today, the jovial September meeting between Netanyahu and Erdogan almost seems like it is from another era. Addressing a pro-Palestine rally in Istanbul last week, Erdogan said Hamas is not a terrorist organization but a liberation group. He also called Israel an occupier and accused the Israeli government of behaving like a ""war criminal"" and trying to ""eradicate"" Palestinians.
Germany, the EU, US and several Arab states, along with other nations, have classified Hamas as a terrorist group. The militant Islamic group does not recognize the state of Israel, and has vowed to destroy it.
In response to Erdogan's speech, Israel recalled its diplomats from Turkey. Writing on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said on October 28 that Israel would ""conduct a reevaluation of the relations between Israel and Turkey."" Diplomatic sources in Ankara have said they expect the Turkish ambassador in Tel Aviv will soon be declared ""persona non grata"" by Israel, which has not yet commented on the matter.
The Israeli war Cabinet currently only comments on its war against Hamas, Middle East analyst Gabriel Haritos told DW. ""But recalling diplomats speaks for itself,"" added Haritos, who works for the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy in Greece, as well as Israel's Ben-Gurion Research Institute.
Many people in Israeli society are angry with Turkey, said Haritos. This is because, he said, they see Turkey as a state that has allied itself with Hamas, a terrorist organization that is like ""a new version of Islamic State."" While Haritos said Erdogan was already unpopular in Israel, now he is even more disliked.
In the first days of the Gaza conflict, Turkey offered to mediate. Yet Turkey soon sided with Hamas, which controls Gaza. Retired Turkish ambassador Safak Gokturk, who spent years working in the Middle East department of the Turkish Foreign Ministry, told DW it was clear Turkey would be limited in its ability to help resolve the crisis. This is due to the ideological links between Turkey's ruling Islamist AKP party and Hamas, he said.

The Turkish government's pro-Hamas stance probably serves a domestic agenda in that ""it needs to satisfy its [voter] base,"" said Gokturk. This base mainly consists of conservative Muslims.
Economic ties between Israel and Turkey have remained strong and even grown in recent years, despite numerous political differences between both countries in the past. The Israeli-Turkish trade volume increased sixfold between 2002 and 2022, from $1.41 billion to $8.91 billion — and Turkey was governed by Erdogan's AKP for this entire period. Israel is also Turkey's 10th most important partner when it comes to exports. And in 2022, a record 700,000 Israeli tourists visited Turkey.
Despite the recent tensions, these good economic relations should survive the current crisis, former Turkish diplomat Bozkurt Aran told DW. Aran, director of the Economic Policy Research Foundation of Turkey, said both countries need each other and that ""businesspeople from both nations have known each other for a long time and trust each other.""
Haritos agrees — he, too, doesn't expect economic ties to deteriorate. ""Quite the opposite: the end of the political romance sparked a business boom for both countries,"" he said.
Turkey was the first Muslim country to recognize the state of Israel in 1949. Israel's founder, David Ben-Gurion, had Ottoman citizenship, spoke Turkish and studied law in Istanbul. Turkish-Israeli bilateral trade and tourism were booming and defense cooperation was considerable before Turkey's AKP party took power in 2002. Israeli fighter pilots, for example, trained in Turkish airspace, and Israeli technicians modernized Turkish fighter planes.
Turkish-Israeli relations did, however, take a serious hit on May 31, 2010 when Israeli naval forces boarded the Mavi Marmara, a Turkish ship delivering aid to Gaza. Nine Turkish activists were killed on the vessel, and Turkey subsequently withdrew its ambassador from Israel.
In 2013, Netanyahu apologized to Erdogan, offering $20 million (about €18.6 million today) in compensation. Further diplomatic crises have followed, however, for instance when then-US President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
Turkey's current stance toward Israel will have significant consequences in the long term, said Aran. ""Undoubtedly, Erdogan's Hamas statement will have an impact, not only on relations with Israel, but also on relations with the West — you can't avoid that,"" he said, before adding that this stance will damage Turkey's global standing and that the government will have to regain trust in foreign affairs. ""Trust is a valuable asset, it is easily lost and hard to regain.""
How bilateral relations will develop between Turkey and Israel will only become clear after the war, added Haritos. ""The only Israeli agenda [right now] is to win this war and destroy Hamas. Only then will Israel remember which governments were friendly and which were not.""

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-more-gloom-as-exports-dip-in-september/a-67297691,BUSINESS,Germany: More gloom as exports dip in September 03.11.2023,"German exports dropped sharply in a year-on-year comparison for September, with imports plummeting even further.
The figures, published by the federal statistics agency Destatis on Friday, further highlight the difficulties faced by German businesses with reduced demand both at home and abroad.
Compared with August, exports for September fell by 2.4%, a bigger drop than the 1.1% expected by experts.
Exports fell 7.5% compared with September 2022, with imports falling by a startling 16.6%.
Destatis said a fall in exports to China of 7.6% from August had weighed heavily on the figures. Shipments to the United States were down 4%, and exports to other EU countries dropped by 2.1%.
Germany's trade surplus — the difference between exports and imports — fell to €16.5 billion from €17.7 billion in August.
On one positive note, the agency revised its figures for August to show a 0.1% growth in exports month-on-month rather than a decline as had been reported previously.
The drop could lead to a downward revision to an estimate earlier this week that Germany's gross domestic product fell by 0.1% in the third quarter of 2023.
""Like the rest of the German economy, exports remain stuck in the twilight zone between recession and stagnation,"" said ING bank economist Carsten Brzeski.
He said supply chain frictions, a more fragmented global economy, and China becoming more of a competitor than an important destination for products were all weighing heavily on exports. Trade has also been harmed by stubbornly high energy prices, slowing demand due to inflation, and elevated interest rates.
""Maybe the only upside of today's disappointing data is that things can hardly get worse,"" Brzeski said. ""However, as positive signals remain absent, the base case for the German economy over the next months remains stagnation at best.""
The German government in October predicted the economy would contract by 0.4% this year, a sharp downgrade from previous government forecasts.
The International Monetary Fund forecasts that Germany will be the only major advanced economy to contract in 2023, creating a drag on growth in the wider eurozone.

https://www.dw.com/en/nfl-kansas-city-chiefs-return-to-germany-33-years-later/a-67273317,SPORTS,NFL: Kansas City Chiefs return to Germany 33 years later 02.11.2023,"Over 50,000 fans in Frankfurt enjoyed themselves as the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Miami Dolphins 21-14 in the first of two games in Germany this November. For Chiefs' star quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the visit was a first, but for the NFL team that has won two of the last four Super Bowls the trip to Germany marked an historic return.
In August 1990, between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the official reunification of Germany, the Chiefs played the Los Angeles Rams in the Olympiastadion in West Berlin.
It was the ninth edition of the now defunct pre-season international series called the American Bowl and the first ever NFL game in Germany. The game was originally supposed to take place in Frankfurt, the western city with a far larger US business and military presence, but the historic political developments forced a change of plan.
""We decided to do the game here after the political events developed so quickly,"" NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue told the LA Times at the time. ""Everyone urged us to do it in Berlin as a way of celebrating the freedom that came to Central Europe in the last year.""
The Chiefs lost that first ever game in Germany 19-3 to the Rams, but for those of the 55,429 fans in attendance who weren't American service personnel who had been given free tickets and trips from various military bases across Europe, this was about much more than just watching a confusing, new sport.
Cheerleaders, tailgating and the Beach Boys being played on the tannoy system offered a chance to sample American life, especially for those who, just months before, had been on the other side of the Iron Curtain.
Indeed, German journalist Irina Prass, who had grown up in East Berlin and went on to become the editor-in-chief of the Berliner Zeitung, is quoted in The Washington Post at the time as saying: ""I'm totally blown away. Such a spectacle. So many things. So American.""
Christian Okoye played just four minutes that day, as is customary for starters during preseason, but the Nigerian running back remembers it well.
""I don't think they [the fans] quite understood it but they were excited the game was there,"" Okoye tells DW.
""It was such a different time. The Wall had just came down and there was a big buzz about that. We all took home souvenirs, pieces of the Wall. I remember coming home with a Soviet officers hat.""
Okoye's NFL story is a fairytale. Originally a discus thrower, among other disciplines, he was surprisingly left out of the Nigerian track and field team for the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles.
Okoye turned to American football, and, despite having never played the game before he was 23, the running back arrived in Berlin off the back of an NFL-best 12-touchdown, 1,480-yard season.
The man nicknamed ""the Nigerian nightmare"" was truly a pioneer for African players. Now a Chiefs' ambassador, he still gets calls today from players coming through from Nigeria and other African nations thanking him for opening the door.
Beyond bringing American football to Germany, Okoye also took great pride in playing in the Olympiastadion.
""The most important thing for me, because of my track and field background, was remembering Jesse Owens won four golds in that stadium,"" Okoye says. 
""It was an historic moment to play where Owens set all those records and where Hitler was in the stands when he did. It was one of the moments I took with me forever.""
Okoye famously said at the game in Berlin that it would take many years for American football to establish itself in Germany.
Today, however, every NFL team has played at least one game internationally since 2011, and Europe's largest economy is a logical match for the world's most lucrative sports league in the world.
Thanks to NFL Europe and a long-lasting domestic league, Germany's NFL fan base has always been a sleeping giant.
Last year, Brett Gosper, NFL Head of Europe, told The Associated Press (AP) that Germany had more casual fans (17 million) than the UK. That number has only risen in the last 12 months, with tickets for the Chiefs vs. Dolphins game selling out in just 15 minutes.
The NFL has grown too. The league's revenue in 1990 was reportedly around $1.3 billion (although that was disputed at the time as being less than the real number). Today, Sportico reports that the league's revenue is roughly $19 billion.
Chiefs President Mark Donovan told AP the team has spent $1 million on preparation and fan events for the game in Frankfurt, including a Chiefs-themed boat on the Main river where fans can take a selfie with the Super Bowl trophy.
This may seem a lot, but looking at the numbers from last year's game between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Seattle Seahawks in Munich, the Chiefs investment is no surprise. Nearly 70,000 fans attended and fan merchandise sales on game day at the Allianz Arena stadium were reportedly the highest ever for an NFL game outside of the US.
The Chiefs will also hope their visit boosted their social media following, boasting the fastest-growing Instagram and TikTok engagement of any NFL team in Germany.
Much may have changed since that pivotal game in Berlin in 1990, but it's still success on the field that counts, and that's what's made the Chiefs one of the most popular US sports teams in the world.
""When you win and you're doing good, people love you, and we have the best quarterback in the world,"" Okoye says, referring to Mahomes. ""What's not to like about the Chiefs?""
With Mahomes delivering another victory in Frankfurt in front of a majority Chiefs-fan crowd, it was clear winning games really is the best way to win hearts.

https://www.dw.com/en/us-fed-holds-interest-rates-steady-at-22-year-high/a-67279355,BUSINESS,US Fed holds interest rates steady at 22-year high 01.11.2023,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday unanimously agreed to hold interest rates steady in a target range between 5.25%-5.5%, where it has been since July.
""The fact is the committee is not thinking about rate cuts right now at all,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a press conference. 
The decision to hold rates high was widely expected, given the Fed's stated goal of slowing inflation to a long-term target of 2%. 
US markets jumped higher after news broke. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 223 points, or 0.7%. The S&P climbed 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.6%.
The Fed chair said the central bank's policymakers recognize the effects of their rate hikes have yet to be fully felt in the economy and that they want to take time to assess the impact.
Powell said holding rates at a steady high allows for a ""better sense of how much more we need to do, if we need to do more.""
The Fed launched its most aggressive series of rate hikes in years in March 2022 to fight inflation. It has now slowed down and raised rates only once since May.
While annual inflation has fallen from its peak last year, it still remains at 3.7%, well above the Fed's 2% annual target.
Powell expressed confidence that inflation, despite some signs of persistence in the most recent monthly data, is still heading lower even as the economy has kept growing.
""The good news is we're making progress,"" Powell said. ""The progress is going to come in lumps and be bumpy, but we are making progress.""

https://www.dw.com/en/german-industry-can-the-backbone-of-the-economy-be-saved/a-67271427,BUSINESS,German industry: Can the backbone of the economy be saved? 01.11.2023,"Business sentiment in Germany is at rock bottom, as Europe's economic powerhouse has reported the worst economic data for the first half of 2023 of the seven most-industrialized countries: While countries like the US and even France are growing, the German economy is set to shrink by 0.4% this year.
A survey conducted by the Federal Association of German Employers (BDA) this month shows that 82% of the surveyed business owners express great concerns about the state of the German economy. Some 88% think the government has no plan whatsoever on how to handle the crises.
Economy Minister Robert Habeck from the environmentalist Greens party has a bunch of massive problems on his plate, including geopolitical challenges from the war in Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East and China's muscle-flexing in Asia. Adding to these are Germany's costly transition to a carbon-neutral economy, a massive infrastructure backlog, the country's slow pace of digitalization, as well as a lack of skilled labor and excessive bureaucracy.
For decades, a strong industrial base — accounting for about 23% of gross domestic product (GDP) — has been the backbone of the German economy, in addition to thousands of family-owned small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
In mid-October, Habeck surprised the German public with a so-called Industrial Strategy — a 60-page catalog of urgently needed measures and plenty of state subsidies to make them a reality over the coming years.
With the plan, the economics minister is following in the footsteps of US President Joe Biden, who is currently shelling out a total of $740 billion (€700 billion) for investments in greener US industries. Called the Inflation Reduction Act,  Biden's plan includes massive tax incentives alongside direct subsidies.
Habeck's strategy has been hugely welcomed by both industry leaders and trade union bosses, who've long been crying out for state support in trying times.
However, the plan didn't go down so well within the German government as a whole, which is made up of three different parties with different economic policies. While Habeck's Greens are known for their state interventionist approach, the liberal Free Democrats are traditionally against state meddling in business, and the Social Democrats loath anything that could harm their working-class voter base.
But what caused the ire of Habeck's coalition partners most was the timing of the strategy and the fact that he didn't discuss it with them before he went public with his proposals.
A key element of the new industrial strategy is a heavily subsidized electricity price for certain industries that are suffering disproportionately from rising energy prices in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Germany's roughly two decades of outstanding economic success had been firmly rooted in cheap Russian energy that companies here turned into goods with a competitive advantage on world markets. Germany was the so-called export champion of the world for many years, and products ""Made in Germany"" became global hallmarks of quality.
 Without cheap Russian gas, industrial companies now have to rely on supplies of more expensive liquefied natural gas (LNG).
As a result, German electricity prices surged to become the highest in the world due to the expensive reliance on gas for power production.
Under his new strategy, Habeck is now calling for a subsidized electricity price for the industry of 6 eurocents ($0.063) per kilowatt-hour. By comparison, Germans are still paying about 40 eurocents for their retail electricity supply, while industries in the US or France enjoy prices as low as 4 eurocents.  
The fixed industrial electricity price is viewed with a wary eye, first and foremost, within Habeck's party of environmentalists. Making energy cheaper runs counter to green climate ideology and attempts to reign in ways of production they deem unfriendly to nature. Rather grudgingly they seem to consent to the plan after realizing that the German population is increasingly overwhelmed by the emerging cost of living crisis. 
The Social Democrats of Chancellor Olaf Scholz largely condone a subsidized price for industry, fearing industrial decline and job losses could fuel the radical political fringes in Germany that are already making big strides in the polls.
It's only that Olaf Scholz, the Chancellor, isn't quite convinced yet, citing economic orthodoxy whereby low prices raise demand and subsequently create shortages that cause prices to go up again. Scholz argues that state subsidies may undermine industry's efforts to save energy and become carbon-neutral.
The toughest resistance to Habeck's plan, however, is coming from the pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP) but less for ideological reasons. Finance Minister Christian Lindner, a member of the FDP, is a staunch defender of Germany's so-called debt-break policy, meaning the government is bound by constitutional constraint to overspend its budget and add to the country's debt burden in a big way. That is why Lindner has simply refused to earmark the €30 billion needed until 2030 in the budget plan for next year.
Amid the government's inability to find common ground, both industry leaders and trade unions have already warned of ""a loss of energy-intensive production"" if the subsidy for industrial energy doesn't come.
Their concern was echoed by Habeck at a recent industry conference in Berlin, where he said that Germany's industrial supply chains were ""very intact from basic materials to final manufacturing.""
""Of course, we can return to manufacturing everything by hand, but then we weaken Germany as a site of industrial production, which is why I have politically decided that this is exactly the wrong consequence now,"" he told an audience of industry captains.
Indeed, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) is repeatedly warning that energy-intensive businesses might be forced to relocate abroad if nothing changes. ""If there is no more chemical industry in Germany, it's an illusion to assume that the transition of chemical plants will continue to happen in Germany,"" BDI President Siegfried Russwurm told the conference.
The Deputy Chairman of the powerful metalworkers' union IG Metall, Jürgen Kerner, added that medium-sized, family-owned companies currently have ""no prospects of continuing their business."" There's great uncertainty, he said, as ""aluminum smelters cease production, and foundries and forges are losing orders."" IG Metall's local branches were increasingly reporting insolvency administrators in the companies, planning ""layoffs, insolvencies, and business closures.""

With German state coffers virtually running on empty amid the multiple and costly crises, a political consensus about how the subsidized industrial electricity price could be financed seems elusive.
The green economics minister is planning to increase national debt for financing, but has added that this could only happen after the next general election in 2025.
Despite the pressure on German industries, lobbyists like BDI's Siegfried Russwurm are against adding to Germany's debt. ""I think we will have to set priorities [in the state budget]. We need to resolve the conflict between what we can afford and what's desirable but which we can no longer afford.""
Habeck is still hoping to convince his coalition bedfellows of the Social Democrats and liberals of his plan to save the German industrial base with state support. Crunch time will be the 2024 budget talks starting in November, for which he sees the odds at ""fifty-fifty"" that an industrial electricity price will be agreed.

https://www.dw.com/en/tigray-stumbles-towards-peace-a-year-after-war/a-67256279,CONFLICTS,Tigray stumbles towards peace a year after war 01.11.2023,"Before the outbreak of the war between the Ethiopian National Defense Forces (FDRE) and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) three years ago, 25-year-old Haftom Kidai had no military experience, had never carried a gun, and was instead engaged in private business.
""When the war started, Ethiopian and Eritrean forces entered Tigray and started to commit atrocities. I then took military training and joined the fight like the other young people of Tigray,"" Haftom told DW.
Haftom was severely injured at the battlefront. Now, half of his body is paralyzed and he lives in an army care center in Tigray's capital city, Mekelle.

Despite all his suffering, the young man does not hold grudges. ""I joined the struggle for my country, for my people and myself. I don't regret the sacrifices I made. I did what I had to do,"" Haftom said.
""But now, all of us here, including myself, have become disabled. We have a lot of demands and needs."" Most importantly, Haftom desires treatment. ""If I get proper treatment, I don't want anything else.""
Many Ethiopians suffered huge losses during the brutal war that began in November 2020. It lasted for two years and killed an estimated 600,000 people, according to former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, the lead peace mediator during the conflict. Many more were injured. In addition, the UN estimates that the fighting displaced nearly 1.7 million people and caused physical and psychological damage to millions of Tigrayans like Haftom.
Negotiations with both fighting parties were mediated by the African Union (AU) in Pretoria when the regional forces from Tigray and the Ethiopian government, on November 3, 2022, signed an agreement on a ""permanent cessation of hostilities."" Finally, the peace agreement ended the civil war in Ethiopia.
After the peace deal, not only did the sound of gunfire stop, but the government also lifted the siege that was imposed on Tigray.
Telephone, internet, transportation, commercial activity, and humanitarian aid supplies, which had been suspended for two years, resumed after the signing of the peace accord.
Slowly, Tigray's capital, Mekelle, came back to life after the end of the war. The residents of the city seem to be enjoying the peace. One, Bilen Mitiku, told DW that ""being able not to hear the sounds of gunfire, aircraft's or drones has been a blessing.""
According to Mitiku, after the peace deal, Tigray seems to be more open to the world in terms of communication and transportation. ""We have rejoined the rest of the world after three years of being in the dark,"" Mitiku said.
However, one year after the peace agreement, there are still many troubling things, Mitiku stressed. ""A lot remains unchanged, a lot remains in the dark, most importantly, our internally displaced brothers and sisters. They have been away from their home close to four years now.""
International aid organizations are still struggling to assist people in need. Drought, cholera and malaria outbreaks — not to mention a plague of locusts — caused more harm and aggravated the dire situation.
According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the humanitarian situation remains critical. Over 1 million people are estimated to have been internally displaced and 1.5 million may require food assistance.
In addition, the UN has warned of ongoing atrocities, including war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Daniel Semungus, a lecturer at Mekelle University, told DW that the first anniversary of the Pretoria agreement has led to unique and mixed feelings among the people of Tigray.
""The suffering of internal displaced people continues to affect us all,"" Semungus said, adding that some progress had been made. ""Communication, the internet is restored. Kids are going to school, people can access health care facilities and there has been a resumption of all forms of transportation.""
Despite this, many people in Tigray continue to demand the full implementation of the peace agreement signed a year ago.
The conflict displaced Hagos Tesfay, who now lives in Tigray's Irob district, that borders Eritrea. His community is under the control of the Eritrean army, he told DW.
""Since the signing of the peace agreement services such as banks, telecoms, and electricity, which were closed in most areas of Tigray, have been opened. But in Erob district, nothing has changed. Most of the Erob district are still controlled by the Eritrean army,"" Hagos said.
Gebreselassie Kidane was displaced from the Western Tigray zone, an area that is now under the control of Amhara militants. ""Three years ago, when the war started, we got out of our homes and saved our lives, but our life here is difficult. There are no basic services. There is no help,"" Kidane said.
He told DW that even after the war had stopped, they could not return to their homes.
The Alliance of Civil Society Organizations of Tigray (ACSOT) claims that the peace agreement signed a year ago has not been fully implemented. ""The federal government is not doing enough to keep its promises,"" Yared Berha, head of Tigrayan Civic Society, told DW.
Redaei Halefom, head of communications at Tigray's interim administration, urged the government to take responsibility for the withdrawal of the foreign forces in Tigray and the immediate return of the citizens displaced due to the war. ""We expect the federal government to get all militants out of the Ethiopian Defense Forces in Tigray,"" Redaei said. He insisted that according to the agreement, Amhara militants and Eritrean soldiers should leave Tigray.

https://www.dw.com/en/scholzs-africa-visit-germany-looks-to-boost-economic-ties/a-67270177,POLITICS,Scholz's Africa visit: Germany looks to boost economic ties 31.10.2023,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's visit to Nigeria and Ghana in West Africa, his third trip to Africa in two years, had the aim of deepening economic ties between Germany and the two African nations.
Nigeria is struggling, with the value of its economy reportedly declining to $477 billion (€451 billion) in 2022 from $546 billion in 2015.
During bilateral talks, Nigeria's president Bola Tinubu wooed investors to the country's mining sector, which has been underdeveloped for decades. He also said he had discussed with Scholz the potential of exporting gas to Europe. 
""The [possibility of the] energy [sector] to facilitate the shipment of liquified gas to Europe is well discussed in advance. We have an eye on this,"" Tinubu said.
German companies aimed to boost their activities in Africa this year, especially in areas such as green hydrogen and liquefied natural gas.
Members of the German African Business Association also signaled their willingness to keep their spending levels in Africa stable.
Chancellor Scholz echoed this. One key area for the anticipated investments he mentioned was the energy sector. Scholz said in Nigeria that one of the main parts of a cooperation between Berlin and Abuja would be ""using the economic opportunities of your country.""
He said that among these opportunities were ""gas and oil, which [are] traditionally linked to your country.""
As Europe's biggest economy, Germany has been seeking to reduce its reliance on Russia for gas since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and it sees the energy sector in Africa as one possible alternative.
In Ghana, West Africa's second largest economy, Chancellor Scholz's discussions with Ghana's President Nana Akufo Addo focused on expanding economic relations in the fields of energy, agriculture and digitalization.

Germany's exports to Ghana in 2022 stood at $314.77 million. Experts believe there is a potential for an increase in trade volumes between the two countries in the coming years.
Some analysts consider Germany the leading supporter of the African Union and its activities. One reason for that is the work of the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), which has several economic programs in place across the African continent.
African Affairs analyst Emmanuel Bensah told DW that Scholz's visit would solidify investments and enable Germany to hold onto this kind of influence in Africa.
""I think we are all familiar with how much GIZ over the past 10 years and more has supported a lot of engagements around the African Union, ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] and many of the region's institutions,"" he said.
He added that Scholz's meeting with the Ghanaian and Nigerian leaders, the heads of two leading nations in West Africa, should enable him to appreciate the impact such programs are having on real people.
Germany has also expressed its support of democracy in Africa, and Scholz highlighted this during his visit to the ECOWAS secretariat, where he expressed concerns over the high number of recent coups across Africa.
Paul Ejime, an international affairs analyst based in Nigeria, explained that having a stable continent furthers the agenda of Germany and the West.
""No country in the global North would go and dump their money in [an unstable] South because investment follows stability and then it follows interest. It follows gains because if you don't have any gains or returns on investment, if the returns on investment were not there, you shouldn't go there,"" Ejime said.
Germany's ""Compact with Africa"" initiative has been a pivotal aspect of its relationship with the continent. Its focus is on migration support systems and helping to re-integrate Africans who wish to return from Germany and Europe.
Germany recently reformed its migration policies and now hopes to attract young skilled labor from the continent.
""I think it is great idea, a great opportunity for these two countries in West Africa to have these conversations with a great supporter of continental synergies and institutions like [Germany],"" Bensah said.
Ahead of the November 20 meeting of Africa and G20 countries in the German capital, Berlin, Scholz hopes to send a signal of his positive intentions across the continent with his Africa visit.
One of the highlights of his visit to Ghana was a meeting with students of Ashesi University in the eastern part of the country.
Interactions between the chancellor and the students were focused on the potential of Africa, and why young people are key to the progress of the continent.
One of the students, Valeria Ackon, told the chancellor Germany and the West must avoid micromanaging the continent.
""As we keep discussing this future of Africa, I would like to draw on Germany's role in this,"" Ackon said. ""External powers tend to forget that Indigenous solutions already exist on the continent, we do not need a Western savior. Ideas exist on the continent and need to be developed and given the stage and opportunity to flourish.""
The chancellor agreed with this and backed the need for Africa to own its growth. Scholz said that the most important take-away from his conversations with the students was that ""with the things, the talent and the techniques that you are developing in Africa, you can do it yourself, and I think this is something that should be mentioned.""

https://www.dw.com/en/bundeswehr-must-be-fit-for-war-says-german-defense-minister/a-67268608,CONFLICTS,"Bundeswehr must be 'fit for war,' says German defense minister 31.10.2023","Defense Minister Boris Pistorius warned on Sunday night that in the current global situation, Germany needed to be prepared for war and able to defend the country. But that required a fundamental re-think about what the Bundeswehr was for.
""We have to get used to the idea again that the danger of war could be looming in Europe,"" the Social Democrat told public broadcaster ZDF on Sunday. ""And that means: We have to become fit for war. We have to be fit for defense. And get both the Bundeswehr and society ready for this.""
Simultaneously calling for more political urgency and defending his own record since taking up office in January this year, Pistorius rejected criticism that his department was working too slowly. ""Much more speed would be impossible,"" Pistorius said.

Prominent critics have appeared in the media in recent weeks to criticize the lack of political will to confront Russian aggression. Retired US General Ben Hodges went so far as to tell public broadcaster ZDF that Germany was in danger of losing the moral authority it had won from facing its Nazi history by failing to confront threats to the international democratic order.
But making the German army ""conflict-ready"" means not only reversing decades of money-saving reforms in the defense budget but also re-thinking what the military is actually for: In other words, fewer missions in foreign countries like Afghanistan or Mali, more focus on defending Germany and Europe. It is, some would argue, understandable that 30 years of relative peace in Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the end of the threat of the Warsaw Pact, have changed the nature of the German army itself.
""We can't just catch up with that in 19 months,"" said Pistorius, before adding that two-thirds of the €100-billion ($106-billion) special military fund Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced last year in his ""turning of the times"" (Zeitenwende) speech was now tied up in contracts. ""The problem is that the contracts don't automatically mean production and delivery — all that takes time,"" he said.

That is true, said Rafael Loss, German and European security policy expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR). ""Industry orders take a significant time … industry needs time to ramp up production capacity, they need time to put together very complex weapons systems and integrate them into the Bundeswehr,"" he told DW.
But he believes a lot of the reforms that Pistorius has brought in are relatively shallow. ""Both the Bundeswehr and the ministry are very busy tweaking at the margins, but the bigger overhaul and the plan for a bigger overhaul are missing,"" he said.
Aylin Matlé, research fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP), is loath to blame Pistorius himself. ""I'd say that his predecessor, Christine Lambrecht, wasted a year of modernization, and did too little,"" she told DW. ""The acceleration of a lot of processes came from Pistorius."" On top of that, one cannot underestimate the financial burdens involved: Calculations from the Bundestag defense committee have suggested that the armed forces actually need another €300 billion to modernize completely.
""Of course, it's not just a question of money,"" added Matlé. ""There's the question of personnel: The Bundeswehr has a recruitment problem.The army currently has 183,000 soldiers, and the aim is 203,000, but it's already clear that the application numbers have actually gone down. The Bundeswehr needs to make sure it's an attractive employer.""

A symptom of the necessary structural changes in the Bundeswehr, according to Loss, is the number of officers in the German army, which is as high as in the late 1980s, when the standing army was much larger. Now, there are too many generals and admirals and not enough sailors and soldiers to serve on ships and drive tanks. ""It's right to point out that today Germany's armed forces are much more top-heavy than they used to be, and that certainly raises questions about its combat-readiness,"" he said.
There's also a mental block in German politics and society about the very idea of Germany being ""ready for war."" Only 14 years ago, then-German Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg triggered controversy when he struggled to call the war in Afghanistan what it was: He famously said that German troops were facing ""war-like conditions"" in the country. ""That already freaked people out,"" said Rafael Loss. ""I think the return of this martial language reflects the deterioration of the security environment in Europe.""
Loss is concerned that the current coalition government spans such ideological differences about how to manage the budget that they won't be able to find a way to fund the military once the €100 billion fund runs out. Pistorius estimates this will happen in 2027 or 2028.
Government politicians have already raised this issue: Green Economy Minister Robert Habeck told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung this week: ""If we take the turning of the times seriously, Germany must do more for its security. The debt brake has good reasons and it applies to the work of this coalition. But we should think beyond today and consider whether the political rules we have given ourselves still fit the changing time Germany wants more women to serve in the military."" Either way, NATO's professed target, of making member states spend 2% of GDP on defense is expensive, and the money will have to come from somewhere.

https://www.dw.com/en/the-origins-of-halloween/a-36214983,CULTURE,The origins of Halloween 31.10.2023,"The streets come alive on the evening of October 31 for All Hallows' Eve, more commonly known as Halloween. Dressed in spooky or comical costumes, kids across the globe walk up and down the streets, ringing doorbells and saying the magic words: ""trick or treat."" For those too old to go door-to-door collecting candy, Halloween parties are the order of the day.
Europeans tend to think that Halloween, which was shaped into its current form in the United States, is a purely commercial holiday, like Valentine's Day, which was popularized mainly by the Hallmark card company and has generated a spending spree, with flowers, jewelry and other gifts bought for loved ones on February 14. The Halloween industry never seems to stop churning out plastic pumpkins and packaged costumes that are sold throughout the world.
In the 13th century, Baron von Frankenstein built this castle on the edge of the Odenwald mountain range. His namesake monster is, however, the invention of the English writer Mary Shelley. Her novel inspired numerous films, but the castle still calls itself the ""real home of the monster."" Here, Halloween is celebrated in style, with a ghoulish spectacle that includes a haunted dinner.







But behind the commercialism lies an actual custom that goes back centuries, although it does not originate in Celtic nations, as some might think. Celtic pagans celebrated Samhain, a Thanksgiving-like festival to mark the beginning of winter, which starts the evening of October 31. Meanwhile, the church, which dominated European culture in medieval times, celebrated All Saints' Day on November 1.
Halloween is derived from ""All Hallows Eve"" — the evening before All Saints' Day when the dead are commemorated and prayers are said for them. According to Christian views, they were waiting for the Last Judgement. In early Christianity, people believed this day would come soon, but it didn't.
""Then people began to ask themselves, 'What about the souls, what are they doing?'"" said Dagmar Hänel, a Bonn-based cultural anthropologist. Out of this, purgatory was born — a stopover between death and eternity where people begin to work off their sins and cleanse themselves. And there was a connection between the living and the souls in the hereafter.

""It is a belief found in all religions: We can influence the afterworld and vice-versa, so we pray the rosary, do good deeds and give alms — apparently that was believed to have a direct effect on the poor souls in purgatory,"" Hänel told DW.
In the Middle Ages, on the eve of All Saints', people went from door to door to ask for alms for the poor. In some rural regions in Germany, the custom is still practiced — bachelors go from village to village, praying, singing, blessing people and soliciting money. In the United States, soliciting has become child's play known as ""trick-or-treating.""
As the influence of the Enlightenment on religion grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, the church became increasingly skeptical of old customs and even banned them, Hänel said, adding that in the course of industrialization, denser social networks developed, so people did not need to collect as much for the poor.
When German statesman Otto von Bismarck's social legislation was implemented in the country in the 19th century, that need for alms disappeared. The state became responsible for providing for the poor. That may be why the custom died out.
But the custom was not quite dead everywhere. Irish immigrants took Halloween to the US in the 19th century. Halloween was mainly celebrated in neighborhoods in large US cities where Irish immigrants lived, according to Lars Winterberg, an anthropologist at the University of Bonn.
""Integration rarely served as a one-way street,"" Winterberg told DW. ""In fact, the immigrant culture always merges with that of the host society."" That's how the Halloween tradition spread across the USA. First, it was more or less a holiday for kids, and later, the adults took part with costume parties and decorations. 
During World War II and after, the celebration returned to Europe when, for example, US soldiers stationed in Germany celebrated Halloween. However, it didn't exactly catch on with Germans at the time. The celebration became more interesting when it spilled over into European culture through films and TV series. 
John Carpenter's 1978 horror movie ""Halloween"" definitely stirred up enthusiasm for the celebration. It blended a mix of Halloweenish elements, from zombies, demons and witches, to vampires, ghosts and children's games. Ironically, Halloween is now celebrated the American way, even in Ireland.
Germany has long been gripped by Halloween fever, too. Both real and plastic pumpkins are displayed in store windows, and many bars host Halloween parties on and around October 31. The main Halloween fans are, of course, younger people and kids.
When the Halloween hype started gaining momentum in Germany back in the 1990s, it seemed the country's well-established carnival industry was trying to force Halloween celebrations on Germans.
In 1991, Carnival's famous Rose Monday parades were canceled due to the Gulf War, University of Würzburg ethnologist Jörg Fuchs recalls. The cancellations were a disaster for the carnival industry, which lost millions in business. Fuchs theorizes that since people also dress up in costumes during Germany's carnival celebrations, organizers ""looked for another festival that could be established in the course of a year,"" which led to the popularity of Halloween, Fuchs says.
Germany has some ideal locations to mark Halloween in 2023. None more than the Ruhr University Bochum. It is said that the ""Eternal Student"" haunts the stairwells. Now and then, someone sees him, but the next moment, he seems to have vanished into thin air again.
Yet many older Germans still prefer to save their costumes only for Carnival. And anyway, Germany's carnival festivities start just a little over a week after Halloween, on November 11. Carnival in Germany lasts until Ash Wednesday of 2023. It, too, is based on an old Christian custom.

https://www.dw.com/en/alpine-ski-world-cup-grapples-with-climate-challenges/a-67257154,SPORTS,Alpine Ski World Cup grapples with climate challenges 30.10.2023,"A little snow did fall after all on the Rettenbach glacier this past weekend. The glacier, which lies near Sölden, Austria, is where the Alpine Ski World Cup kicked off its new season with two giant slalom races. While the women's event went off without a hitch on Saturday, Sunday's men's competition had to be canceled due to high winds.
Sölden has hosted the opening event of the season since 2000. This year, there wasn't much of a winter feel to the weekend until the very end; the mountains around the glacier were barely covered with snow, the slopes towards the valley were green, the trees sporting the colors of autumn. And even up on the glacier, the thin layer of fresh snow could hardly conceal the problems that Alpine ski racing is facing.
""I think the slope is perfect for hosting a World Cup opener,"" Felix Neureuther told Bavarian media a few weeks ago. ""But the end of October is just too early.""
Neureuther, who was Germany's top ski racer before he retired from the sport in 2019, is concerned about the event's future, partly because organizers are having to contend with less and less natural snow on the slopes.
To get the Rettenbach slopes ready for last weekend's event, 45,000 cubic meters (nearly 1.6 million cubic feet) of snow that had been stored in depots since April was spread over the course. This is not the first time organizers have had to take such measures to ensure that the season opener could go ahead.
Such circumstances have caused some to question the wisdom of starting the winter season so early. However, the Ski World Federation FIS under President Johan Eliasch has inflated the World Cup calendar to 45 races for both the women and men in recent years, leaving little scope for moving the opener to a later date.
Still, Eliasch surprised Austrian public broadcaster ORF on the weekend when he said: ""I also don't understand who is interested in ski racing in October and why we race on glaciers without snow.""
Eliasch said he hoped that the Austrian Ski Association would be open to moving back the Sölden event.
He had also, however, pushed for races to be held on the Matterhorn in mid-November. At the end of November, the World Cup heads to North America for a couple of weekends before returning to Europe. A race is scheduled for every weekend leading up to Christmas.
This tight schedule forced the October opener in Sölden, as well as all the work that had to be done to get the Rettenbach glacier ready in time. This included the bringing in of excavators to shave off the edge of the glacier in preparation for the application of the stored snow.
That drew harsh criticism from environmentalist groups.
""The current destruction of nature on the Rettenbach glacier is a disaster. Skiing and conservation are being played off against each other here,"" Ursula Bittner, an economics specialist at Greenpeace Austria, told Austrian media in September.
The organizers defended themselves, saying it was not a matter of removing the glacier. Instead, they explained, large rocks that had come to the surface as a result of the glacier receding needed to be crushed. Doing so, they argued, meant that less snow was needed to prepare the slope. In other words, the excavator work was in the interest of sustainability.
This illustrates just how emotional and complicated the dispute is between environmental interests and the million-dollar downhill skiing business. It is also indicative of a growing problem for outdoor winter sports in general.
The Winter Olympics are no exception. When Sochi, a Black Sea resort with a subtropical climate hosted the 2014 Games, the ski resorts were located dozens of kilometers away. Major construction projects were undertaken to build not only the ski runs but also the infrastructure for traveling between the two locations.
Beijing, the host of the 2022 Winter Games, isn't known for its heavy snowfall either. The same goes for the two Olympic ski resorts, which were located in a region that is cold enough, but hardly gets any precipitation.
""Fewer and fewer countries are capable of hosting the Winter Olympics in the first place,"" Jules Boykoff told DW. The political scientist from Pacific University in Oregon has been critically examining the Olympic Games and their impact on society and the environment for years.
International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach, too, is well aware of the problem.
""By 2040, there remain, practically, just 10 national Olympic committees who could host these snow events of the Olympic Winter Games,"" Bach told the recent IOC Congress in Mumbai, based on the findings of a study on future viability.
As a result, the IOC is considering implementing a rotation system for hosts, comprising only a few locations that are all but guaranteed to regularly have the required amount of snow in February.
As Boykoff noted, the lack of reliable snow is not the only challenge facing the games, with residents of numerous cities having rejected the idea of hosting a Winter or Summer Olympics from 2013 through 2018.
""You are seeing a rising tide of people across the political spectrum who do not want to have the Olympics in their city or in their country because of the price tag and because of the environmental effects,"" he said.
The 2026 Winter Games are to be hosted by Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, where mass protests over exploding costs and ecological concerns convinced organizers to abandon plans to build a new bobsleigh and luge track. These events may be moved to Innsbruck, Austria.
Where the Winter Games go after 2026 is unclear and, if no traditional winter venue steps up, the IOC could soon find itself in a dilemma. Saudi Arabia won the right to host the 2029 Asian Winter Games with a plan to spend $500 billion (€472 billion) to construct venues and infrastructure. Depending upon how well that goes, the Winter Olympics could be the next logical step, as early as 2034.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-seeks-nigeria-energy-and-migration-partnerships/a-67253189,POLITICS,Germany seeks Nigeria energy and migration partnerships 30.10.2023,"The German chancellor continued his visit to Nigeria on Monday in an effort to deepen ties with the African continent's most populous country.
Scholz called for a closer partnership with Nigeria when it came to managing migration, including the repatriation of Nigerians who did not have the right to stay in Germany. 
The Chancellor also spoke of potential cooperation between the two nations on energy as Germany looks to diversify its sources of natural gas.
The German chancellor proposed expanding migration centers in Nigeria to support returnees from Germany. Scholz said the centers could also be used to advise skilled workers to become established in Germany. 
""This requires some preparation and investment — on both sides,"" Scholz said, adding that he had spoken about the issue with Nigerian President Bola Tinubu on Sunday.

""I am convinced that this is another area where we can exploit enormous potential arising from closer cooperation between our two countries and between our two continents,"" Scholz said, speaking at an economic forum in the coastal city of Lagos on Monday.
Tinubu has said he supports the repatriation of migrants, provided that they are Nigerian.
Proving this might be the most difficult part of the scheme because their identity cannot be established. 
Of almost 14,000 asylum seekers from Nigeria obliged to leave Germany, some 12,500 are allowed to stay mostly because they have no identity papers.
In an interview published before the trip, which will also include a visit to Ghana, Scholz revealed that he was seeking to import natural gas from the country, which is also Africa's largest economy.

""Nigeria has the biggest gas supply in Africa,"" Scholz told the Nigerian daily The Punch. ""German companies are interested in gas deliveries from Nigeria and look forward to cooperation with Nigerian gas companies.""
While Germany already imports large quantities of crude oil from Nigeria, it does not import gas.
The chancellor said Berlin was also exploring ""joint initiatives to ramp up the hydrogen market,"" with hydrogen expected to play an important role in meeting future energy needs.
But with the hydrogen market still underdeveloped and Germany no longer being supplied natural gas by Russia, the importing of liquefied natural gas (LNG) has taken on a greater significance.
Nigeria has emerged as an option for Germany, with Norway now Germany's main supplier of LNQ.
""Nigeria has an ambitious plan for the energy transition,"" Scholz said at an economic forum in Lagos on Monday. ""And you are also well positioned to remain a key player for renewable energy and hydrogen — as well as for liquefied natural gas, which we will continue to need in the coming years until the hydrogen market is fully established.""

The German chancellor also pointed out that there was potential for greater cooperation and investment between the two countries in other sectors.
""This applies to a variety of sectors, ranging from infrastructure and energy to agriculture business, mineral resources, information and communication technologies, transport and logistics, and beyond,"" he told The Punch.
Scholz also pointed out that Nigeria was Germany's second-largest trading partner in sub-Saharan Africa, with direct German investments in Nigeria amounting to €150 million ($158 million) in 2021.
Scholz has said Germany ought to expand support for Nigeria's military and the police when it comes to the fight against Islamist terror groups such as Boko Haram, which operates in the northeastern part of Nigeria.
The extremist group carries out bloody attacks against civilians and has increasingly taken control of swaths of territory.
Nigeria has emerged as one of West Africa's most stable democracies since the end of a military dictatorship in 1999.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-seeks-investment-boost-in-africa/a-67219434,BUSINESS,Germany seeks investment boost in Africa 29.10.2023,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz departed Berlin for Nigeria on Sunday, on what is his third trip to Africa since taking office almost two years ago.
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier is set to do likewise on Monday, when he will arrive for talks in Tanzania and Zambia.
Scholz and Steinmeier will focus on Germany's economic relations with countries linked to the reform of Berlin's ""Compact with Africa"" initiative ahead of the November 20 meeting of African and G20 countries in Berlin.
Germany has set a new tone on dealing with countries in Africa, as German businesses are keen to become more active on the continent. In the wake of Russia's war in Ukraine and growing tensions with China, German companies are increasingly turning their attention to African countries in search of new economic potential.
""Now is the time when we have to make a new start as far as North-South relations are concerned, which will make it possible to develop joint perspectives with the many countries of the south on an equal footing,"" Scholz said during his last Africa trip in May.
Last year, Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) pledged €100 million ($105 million) to Nigeria over two years to support small and medium-sized enterprises, help with agriculture, expand the renewable energy sector and promote women's employment.
Scholz is expected to follow up on this during talks with President Bola Tinubu. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, is ranked jointly with Egypt as Africa's largest economy.
Scholz and Tinubu are also due to discuss regional security and global issues, according to Berlin. This will also be the case when Scholz travels on to Ghana for a meeting with President Nana Akufo-Addo and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) President Omar Touray. ECOWAS is currently leading the mediation process with the military junta in Niger, which took power in a coup in July.
Ghana is a stable democracy and considered a safe business location in West Africa, said Burkhardt Hellemann, the head of the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Ghana.
""Many German companies have chosen Ghana because of this, in order to also trade in the region or into the region... in Togo, Benin, Ivory Coast, Senegal, and so on,"" Hellemann told DW.
While Scholz is in West Africa, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will head to East Africa.
On his first stop in Tanzania, Steinmeier is due to meet with President Samia Suluhu Hassan.
In contrast to her predecessor, John Magufuli, Hassan is pursuing a pragmatic and more business-friendly course and is seen as a beacon of hope for reforms in the country, especially for women and girls.
Steinmeier's trip to Tanzania comes as no surprise, said Maren Diale-Schellschmidt, head of the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry in neighboring Kenya.
""The investment framework for German companies has improved significantly in the two years since President Samia Suluhu Hassan has been in power,"" she told DW.
According to Diale-Schellschmidt, Tanzania is catching up on infrastructure, energy and environmental technology — a sector that is of particular interest to Germany. German companies are looking beyond northern and southern Africa and opening more and more new locations in the west and east of the continent, she said. 
When Steinmeier meets with representatives of the German and Tanzanian business communities, the focus will be precisely on the economic prospects and trade.
Professor X.N. Iraki, an economist at the University of Nairobi, said ties between the two countries run deep. Tanzania was part of German East Africa from 1885 to 1918.  
""Tanzania has a lot of agricultural land, a lot of minerals, but it needs someone to invest in these sectors,"" Iraki told DW. Tanzania is also counting on cooperation with Germany as a counterweight to China, which has invested heavily in Tanzania, especially in the transport sector, he said.
On the second day of his visit, Steinmeier will focus on the history of German colonial rule, when what is now Tanzania was part of German East Africa.
Steinmeier is due to travel to Songea in the south of the country to visit the graves of victims of the 1905-1907 Maji Maji rebellion and meet with their descendants.
According to Iraki, coming to terms with the colonial past is currently trendy.
""They [former colonial powers] pay reparations, apologize or make peace with those who suffered under colonial rule,"" he told DW. ""Maybe Germany wants to come to terms with this historical atrocity or the injustice that many Tanzanians suffered during the colonial period.""
That, Iraki believes, would be desirable for both Tanzania and Germany.
Steinmeier's subsequent state visit to southern Zambia on November 1 will be the first ever by a German president.
Talks with Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema are expected to focus on water as a resource. While in the country, Steinmeier will inspect a water extraction plant on the Zambezi River — the product of a German development cooperation project.

More than 154,000 people were affected by a series of earthquakes that devastated the western Herat province in early October, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Local media have reported that more than 2,000 people were killed and thousands injured.
""The injured, including many women and children, are in dire need of medical assistance,"" volunteer worker Niloufar Nikseyar told DW. A former lecturer at Herat University, she has been supporting local aid groups since the earthquakes.
""I was in three small villages today where many houses were completely destroyed. The first relief supplies such as flour and water have finally arrived there. The women have to bake bread and provide for their families with the limited resources they have. There is a shortage of everything here, especially powdered baby formula, cough syrup and sanitary pads,"" she added.

Initial assessments by the World Health Organization have found that more than 40 health care facilities in the region were damaged by the quakes. Others remain at acute risk of collapse, complicating patient care.
More than 114,000 people in Afghanistan are now in need of emergency medical assistance, according to the WHO. Among them are about 7,500 pregnant women, many of whom lost family members in the disaster.
""Many of them were at home when the earth shook, while the men were outside working on farms or tending to livestock,"" Lina Haidari, a teacher and activist who has been helping local women affected by earthquakes, told DW.
The United Nations has reported that more than 90% of the victims of the earthquakes were women and children. Haidari stressed that many of the injured have also been severely traumatized and now live in fear of aftershocks.
International aid organizations such as the United Nations Children's Fund have warned that the situation is deteriorating, especially as winter approaches.
""We urgently appeal for additional funding to aid 96,000 children affected by the recent earthquakes in western Afghanistan,"" Fran Equiza, UNICEF's representative in Afghanistan, said in a statement last week, reporting that it had already delivered more than 80 tons of relief supplies to Kabul for distribution in the affected region.
The ruling Taliban have set up a commission to distribute aid fairly among those affected. This commission is responsible for preventing corruption and ensuring that everyone receives the aid they need, spokesperson and senior member of the Taliban, Zabiullah Mujahid, told DW.
But many activists inside and outside Afghanistan have doubts about the ability of the Islamic fundamentalist nationalist movement to handle this crisis. Afghans outside the country are desperate to support their relatives and friends, but finding the right channels to do so has been difficult.
""It is necessary that we find ways to help people on the ground,"" Afghan journalist Zahra Joya told DW. She lives in London and is editor-in-chief and founder of Rukhshana Media, a news agency that reports on the lives of women and girls in Afghanistan. ""Women and children in particular need our support now. We are trying to form support groups on the ground and organize help for them.""
Transferring money directly is not possible, she said. Since the Taliban took power in August 2021, the economic situation has deteriorated dramatically. Not only has the United States imposed economic sanctions on the Taliban because of human rights abuses, but the country has also been excluded from the SWIFT international financial transaction system.
Previously, people had used exchange offices to deposit cash that would then be paid out by a business partner in Afghanistan — an unofficial workaround that required a telephone connection and mutual trust. But activists told DW that this now no longer works.
""In Afghanistan, cash has become scarce. But even with cash, many things can no longer be bought, such as powdered baby formula,"" one source said. Leaving many with few options but to rely on the Taliban for aid.

https://www.dw.com/en/russias-erotic-webcam-streaming-sites-hit-by-ukraine-war/a-67238273,SOCIETY,Russia's erotic webcam streaming sites hit by Ukraine war 28.10.2023,"Webcam streaming sites are booming in Russia. Despite attempts by authorities to clamp down, the gray market for erotic online services has been growing for years.
The COVID-19 pandemic drove up demand for adult cam models, sometimes known as cam girls or boys, but since Russia's invasion of Ukraine business hasn't been so simple for the Russian models who do it. DW spoke with several of them, changing their name to protect their identity.
Models offer their streamed services on specialized platforms, where chatting is free in groups of two people or more and users can offer models payments to fulfill certain desires.
Private chats are also available, billed by the minute. Some clients only want to chat or flirt, while others are looking for virtual sex or to have certain kinks satisfied. Models said their main reason for doing the work is that it provides a stable, above-average income.
Webcam studios offer online calculator tools for those interested in modeling to work out how much they could potentially earn. The St. Petersburg-based studio Exotica, for example, promises a monthly income of 120,000 rubles (about €1,200/$1,270) for a 40-hour week.
A new model can earn the equivalent of about €20 on the first day of work, up to €75 with a basic knowledge of English and for those deemed attractive with high-quality video equipment and sex toys, as much as €200 a day.
The average monthly salary in Russia in the second quarter of this year was around €745, according to official statistics.
""I studied a sensible profession and got a lot of good job offers after graduation, but the pay was simply not comparable to the webcam business,"" Angelina, a cam girl, told DW.
However, competition has become much stiffer since the start of Russia's war on Ukraine in early 2022. Many more Russian women have signed up to the webcam platforms, partly because a lot of the Russians who have moved to neighboring countries due to the war haven't found work.
The invasion of Ukraine has changed the lives of many Russians, and webcam models like Angelina are no exception.
When hostilities first broke out, foreign customers would insult her because of her country of origin. As a Russian citizen, she was also blocked from the popular UK-based erotic content platform OnlyFans, pushing down her income.
Now the young woman works on the platform Chaturbate, where she earns the equivalent of €2,100 on average each month, minus the fees for the platform. She usually works 17 days a month, for four hours each working day.
""My account on OnlyFans used to bring in about $300 a month. I also have a page on the Fansly platform, but there I rarely get as much as $100,"" explained Angelina.
Western economic sanctions imposed on Russia because of the war have also hit webcam models, who quickly had to find new platforms. As before, they get their income mostly in cryptocurrencies and through foreign payment systems, allowing them to circumvent Russian tax authorities.
Since the war broke out, many users in chats with Russia are on edge. They can tell from a model's accent and appearance that they are Russian. To avoid aggressive comments from clients, the models often claim to be streaming from Ukraine or Belarus.
In the first months of the conflict, some models even pretended to be Ukrainian to earn more. But the platforms quickly put an end to this, blocking their accounts.
Even those who openly oppose the war aren't spared insults. ""In the first month of the war, I was confronted with a real wave of hate. Someone called me a Russian orc,"" she said. Many Ukrainians call Russian soldiers 'orcs,' an ugly and evil creature from the ""Lord of the Rings"" fantasy series. But Angelina said her regular customers stuck up for her.
Ekaterina, who streams on the platform LiveJasmin, also told DW of receiving hate comments. ""I can't even keep up with blocking all the users who want to make me angry and hurt me just because I'm Russian. On these websites, you can ban certain words so they don't show up in chat, but it's only the models who can't see them."" Arguing about politics in online chat scares off customers, she said, costing her traffic and revenue.
But webcam model Oleg said aggressive behavior toward Russians has now decreased significantly. ""There were only insults at the beginning of the war, but now no one cares anymore. It's clear to many that it's not ordinary Russians who are to blame, but the Russian leadership,"" said Oleg.
The only platform that stopped working with Russian citizens was OnlyFans, because it was difficult to transfer money to Russia. The other platforms, none of which have responded to DW's inquiries, are still available to models in Russia. However, the models have to use a virtual private network to mask their location.
The adult webcam industry isn't covered by Russian law, so there is no direct ban. However, people can be prosecuted in Russia under Article 242 of the Criminal Code for showing and advertising pornographic material, according to Russian lawyer Andrei Popov.
Prison sentences of two to five years may be imposed in such cases, said Popov. If several people collude to commit the crime, the maximum penalty climbs to six years.
But cam models are more or less left in peace, he told DW. Authorities tend to go after administrators and owners of webcam studios, though even these people are rarely handed hefty sentences. ""If a person has no previous convictions and admits their guilt, they normally end up getting a suspended sentence,"" Popov explained.
Only same-sex partner streams can lead to actual punishments, said Popov. These count as ""propaganda for nontraditional relationships"" and can lead to hefty fines, the equivalent of €1,000 to €2,000.
To minimize the risk of conviction and earn more, some models avoid working from webcam studios and sign up independently on platforms.
The studios don't seem in a hurry to stop them, despite increased attention from authorities. Admins often send out job offers via instant messengers and social networks.
On HH.ru, the largest Russian recruitment platform, it's possible to find several companies in various Russian cities using the search term ""model,"" secretly inviting young women and men to interview in front of a webcam. Their pitch? High earnings and a flexible schedule.

https://www.dw.com/en/eu-qatargate-scandal-a-murky-prosecution-case/a-67111934,POLITICS,EU-Qatargate scandal: A 'murky' prosecution case 28.10.2023,"A former suspect in the case of the European Union's Qatargate corruption scandal has called into question the integrity of the Belgian state's investigation into the alleged crimes.
After his unconditional release from prison in February, Niccolo Figa-Talamanca has decided to speak out in an interview with DW, alleging the Belgian justice system is not handling the case correctly. ""The way they're doing it is all very murky,"" he said.
Figa-Talamanca, 51, was one of four people arrested in December 2022 raids on suspicion of being involved in a cash-for-favors corruption ring in the European Parliament. His human rights organization, No Peace Without Justice, was linked to the corruption scandal.
Following his release, he was reinstated as secretary-general of the nongovernmental organization.
The other suspects in the case are Greek Member of the European Parliament (MEP) Eva Kaili, her life partner Francesco Giorgi, and his boss, former Italian MEP Antonio Panzeri. Subsequently, two other MEPs, Marc Tarabella and Andrea Cozzolino, were also arrested. Cash found in the raids totaled €1.5 million ($1.58 million), none of which was in the home of Figa-Talamanca.
The accused are suspected of taking bribes from Qatar, Morocco and Mauritania in exchange for using their political clout to sway EU policies in favor of those countries.
Despite his release after two months behind bars in Brussels, Figa-Talamanca's name remains on the case file — in Belgium, charges can only be formally dropped once the case goes to trial.
Figa-Talamanca said having a career devoted to supporting people defending human rights is leading him to speak out against what he sees as ""murky"" prosecution practices.
His decision to voice his concerns publicly comes after the former judge on the closed Qatargate file, Michael Claise, gave interviews to a Belgian radio station on September 9 this year.
""Everything is in the file. The truth is found there, not in the television studios nor in certain magazines,"" Claise said. ""The truth will explode one day in the face of manipulators who try to distort it.""
For Figa-Talamanca, those comments ignite serious concerns about the handling of the investigation, while there is very little information on the case files in the public domain.
""People who make vague threats and speak by allusion cannot then complain and cannot ascribe mafiosi methods to others,"" said the Italian NGO head. ""Because this is what mafiosi do themselves.""
The Belgian justice system has faced a deluge of criticism for leaks to the press from the investigation.
DW contacted Claise for a response to all of Figa-Talamanca's allegations. He responded to our request by saying: ""Impossible. My job is built on secrets.""
The judge was eventually recused from the case in June 2023 when it was revealed that his son is in business with the son of Belgian MEP Maria Arena, another potential suspect in the case.
Claise has also filed his own legal case to try to identify the perpetrators of what he calls a public smear campaign against him, according to Le Soir newspaper.
Judge Aurélie Dejaiffe is now in charge of the Qatargate file.

One of the long-standing questions of the Qatargate scandal is what exactly prompted the investigation in the first place, which Belgian authorities have never clarified. 
Figa-Talamanca suggests it could have started with an investigation into him personally, following a report he commissioned on corruption he believed was happening inside the European Parliament.
He was part of a collective of NGOs in February 2022 to commission and publish an ""Undue Influence Report"" that alleges money from the United Arab Emirates was being used to bribe MEPs, none of whom were later implicated in Qatargate.
There are no indications that the allegations in the report were investigated by police and were ever substantiated.
Figa-Talamanca believes the report sparked sufficient anger with Emirati authorities, who then began looking into him.
In July 2023, the European Network of Investigative Journalists released a set of leaks that claimed the United Arab Emirates tasked a Swiss private intelligence company called Alp Services to run ""character assassination"" campaigns against supporters of their regional rivals, Qatar.
Figa-Talamanca was one of their 18 targets. His theory is that those investigations hit on the corrupt practices of Qatargate suspect Antonio Panzeri, with whom Figa-Talamanca was sharing an office at the time.
""Originally, my thought was that having caught the others [Kaili, Panzeri and Giorgi] red-handed with cash in their homes, I was thrown in for good measure as somebody who was obviously bothering a friendly country [UAE] by denouncing their undue influence in European affairs,"" Figa-Talamanca said.
""Now, looking back, it might have been the other way round, that the undue influence report exposed them [the UAE], and they wanted to find anything they could on me or around me.""
DW reached out to the Belgian prosecutor for a response. ""In regard [to] the secrecy of the instruction and in the interest of the inquiry, we can't answer your questions,"" was the office's reply.
Figa-Talamanca said that during his interviews with Belgian investigators, they asked him about an expensive designer watch gifted to him during an advisory trip to Qatar's National Human Rights Commission.
He denies that accepting the watch amounts to corruption. ""It was valued at €4,000, and it still belongs to my organization, not to me personally,"" protested Figa-Talamanca to DW. ""Not accepting it would have been rude.""
The exact details of the Belgian prosecutor's case against the Qatargate suspects are still under wraps.
""There is nothing specific that I'm accused of, so it's impossible for me to defend myself,"" Figa-Talamanca said. 
He also questions whether testimonies given in prison by some co-defendants can be relied upon.
Leaked transcripts of interviews with Antonio Panzeri and Francesco Giorgi reveal admissions of their guilt and insights into the network of corruption. Those transcripts appear to clear Figa-Talamanca of any criminal involvement, but despite that, he now claims they may be untrustworthy.
""Do we accept that what they said is specific and correct?"" he said. ""The circumstances of detention in St. Gilles [prison] are ones that lead you to tell investigators whatever they want to hear to gain your freedom.""
Similar claims were made by Kaili, who still protests her innocence.
""Panzeri's confessions were obtained under duress,"" said the Greek MEP in an interview with French newspaper Liberation. ""If I had mentioned important names, I would have been released immediately and returned to my daughter.""
The Belgian prosecutor's office again declined to respond to DW's request for comment on this matter.
Figa-Talamanca said giving this interview to DW was part of his campaign to clear his name. Being linked to an international corruption scandal has had a greatly detrimental effect on his professional work as a human rights defender.
""Redress for what has happened to me will never exist,"" sighed Figa-Talamanca. ""The reputational damage against me and the organization I represent is enormous.""
In the meantime, Figa-Talamanca fears the case has exposed massive pitfalls in the Belgian justice system.
""If somebody like me, the secretary-general of a well-known human rights organization, is subject to this behavior in countries like Belgium, then we really have lost any sort of compass,"" he said.
The claims made by Figa-Talamanca in this article may contradict evidence that comes to light as the legal proceedings of the Qatargate case progress.

https://www.dw.com/en/what-the-israel-hamas-conflict-means-for-germanys-economy/a-67210393,BUSINESS,What the Israel-Hamas conflict means for Germany's economy 27.10.2023,"As Israel makes its first incursions into Gaza, the world is holding its breath in anticipation of a full ground offensive. 
But while most eyes are focused on the unfolding humanitarian disaster, policymakers and business leaders are growing increasingly concerned about the economic impact of a lasting conflict between Israel, Hamas and others in the region.
While German exports to Israel make up just 0.4% of the country's total exports — ranging from vehicles, auto parts, machinery, renewable energy, chemicals and pharmaceuticals — the Mediterranean country has long been a key economic partner.
""Trade and foreign direct investment between the two countries is small, but for technology transfer and cooperation in research in natural science and physics, Israel is extremely important and has been since the 1960s,"" Rolf Langhammer, a senior research staffer at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW Kiel), told DW.
In recent years, German firms have also built strong relations with many of Israel's tech startups. According to the German government website, major companies like Merck and Siemens recruit top-class engineers from Israel, while Deutsche Telekom, Bosch, Daimler, Volkswagen and BMW have research and development centers in Israel or have invested in fledgling firms.

Industry leaders expect cooperation between the two countries to remain strong, especially as Israel is a leader in cybersecurity, biotech, health and renewable energy as well as innovating in the food sector. But, in the short term, many projects could be put on hold as uncertainty reigns over the direction of the Israel-Hamas conflict.
""There's a big fear [among German companies] of an escalation, especially if Iran or others get involved,"" Charme Rykower, deputy managing director of the German-Israel Chamber of Industry and Commerce, told DW. ""I don't want to imagine the outcome if we have a long, bloody conflict ahead of us.""
Rykower said German firms operating in Israel are, for now, taking a wait-and-see approach, but noted how the Israeli economy is already suffering from the effects of the Hamas attacks on October 7.
The shekel has fallen to multiyear lows against the dollar, and hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been called up to the army, leaving many firms without adequate staff cover. Thousands more employees have been placed on unpaid leave temporarily as customers stay at home due to the security threat.
""We have to be patient and hope that this conflict does not escalate and that things will recover in a few weeks,"" Rykower added.
The German government has emphatically thrown its support behind Israel's right to defend itself. But at the same time, Germany must perform a delicate balancing act as other Middle Eastern countries have denounced Israel's military tactics in the fight against the Hamas militant group, which has been identified as a terrorist organization by the EU, the US, Germany and many other countries. Many of these nations are, or have the potential to be, even more important economic partners for Germany.
Qatar, for example, is playing an intermediary role in helping to secure the release of some 220 hostages captured by Hamas in Israel during the October 7 attacks. The Gulf Arab nation has also fiercely criticized Israel's fight against Hamas, which has so far left more than 7,000 people dead, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry.
This week, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani said ""Israel shouldn't be granted an unconditional green light and unrestricted authorization to kill"" Palestinians.
IfW Kiel's Langhammer told DW that: ""Qatar stands out as the most important Middle East investor in Germany. It has stakes in companies like Volkswagen, Deutsche Bank and Siemens."" He noted how last year, amid the European energy crisis that saw natural gas prices skyrocket, Germany also signed a deal with Qatar to secure supplies of liquified natural gas (LNG), which will begin in 2026.

""Any sort of escalating crisis would hit Germany hard because of its dependence on energy from the region. But at the same time, a country like Qatar doesn't want to see its investments in top German companies go down the drain,"" Langhammer added. ""The bigger threat is, of course, Iran.""
Iran, which backs Hamas and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah — which has also been fighting Israel — has previously threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz in ongoing tensions with Israel and the West. The strait is the world's most important oil chokepoint because of the large volumes of oil that are shipped through the waterway.
Iran is mostly decoupled from trade with the West over its disputed nuclear program, which is subject to US and EU sanctions.
Other countries in the region, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia with their respective populations of 109 million and 36 million, are also of growing interest to German exporters.
""Economic ties with the Middle East region are of strategic importance,"" Helene Rang, CEO of the German Near and Middle East Association, told DW. ""Among the key factors here are the geographical proximity as well as the growing sales and consumer markets due to large local populations.""
Rang spoke of huge upcoming infrastructure projects, including Saudi Arabia's Neom — a huge futuristic city being built along the Red Sea at a cost of half a trillion dollars — which offer opportunities to German businesses.
""We hope it [an escalating conflict] will not have a huge impact on economic cooperation. The situation is difficult ... [but] at the same time, we hope that a solution will be found through international diplomacy. The peace meeting in Egypt was an important first step,"" Rang said, referring to a summit of world leaders and international envoys on October 21.

https://www.dw.com/en/serbia-migrants-die-in-shooting-near-hungary-border/a-67232534,CRIME,Serbia: Migrants die in shooting near Hungary border 27.10.2023,"Three migrants died in a shootout near Serbia's border with Hungary on Friday.
Criminal gangs have been fighting for control of the area along an EU entry route used by smuggling rings.
A gunbattle took place between migrants in an abandoned warehouse complex in a village called Horgos.
Serbian media reported that it was not clear who had initiated the shooting that also left another person seriously injured.
A number of officers attended the scene but the police are yet to release a statement.
Hungary told leaders at the EU summit on Friday in Brussels they need to act quickly to end migration in the area from continuing.
Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said Hungary's previous warnings to the EU over ""the rising rate of violence and terror committed by migrant gangs"" has apparently fallen on deaf ears.
""I think it should be high time for Brussels to realize, it’s not quotas and migrant camps we need, but a quick and organized effort to protect our borders, and ensure the safety of our citizens,"" Kovacs said on social media platform X, formerly know as Twitter.
People smugglers operate heavily on the border between Serbia and European Union member Hungary.
Reports of violence and gunbattles are common in the area, as migrants look for a route into the EU.
In September, two people died in similar confrontations, with one being fatally shot in a busy department store's car park in the centre of the border town of Subotica.
Hungary’s government has put up a razor wire fence on their frontier with Serbia in an attempt to stop the flow of migration.

https://www.dw.com/en/olympics-problems-facing-paris-2024/a-67230968,SPORTS,Olympics: Problems facing Paris 2024 27.10.2023,"With less than nine months to go until the opening ceremony at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, the French capital is engaged in a race against time to get things ready.
DW rounds up some of the key challenges facing Paris ahead of the Games:
Anyone who has visited Paris will have encountered the hundreds of street vendors who ply their trade among the tourist crowds of the city center.
But authorities want to put an end to the unofficial industry, stopping people from selling on the streets ahead of the Olympics.
""We will have completely eradicated the phenomenon of street vending, fortune-telling and other delinquent activities,"" said Laurent Nunez, the prefect of police for Paris.
Among those businesses facing expulsion are the traditional bouquinistes, the booksellers who have been offering their wares from the wooden stalls along the banks of the Seine since the 16th century.
Police have said the traditional stalls, some of which have stood for over a century, could pose a bomb threat, especially with the area thronged by tens of thousands of spectators for the opening ceremony which will take place on and along the river.
It's not just books and cultural trinkets that are being cleared off Parisian streets; human beings are, too.
Although authorities insist it has nothing directly to do with the Olympics next year or the Rugby World Cup, the French government has been accelerating plans to transfer homeless people living on the streets of Paris to other French cities.
Approximately half of France's 200,000 homeless people live on the streets or in shelters in Paris and the surrounding Ile-de-France region, where they stand to benefit from better job chances, access to charities and contact with family and friends.
According to government figures disclosed to CNN in September, around 1,800 homeless people, mostly migrants, have been transferred out of Paris since April 2023 to alternative locations across the country — a rate of just over 50 people per week.
But the situation on the streets has nevertheless been exacerbated by the decisions of hotels to cancel their emergency housing contracts with the government to free up space for the anticipated influx of tourists for the Olympics.
Back in May, former Housing Minister Olivier Klein said in a parliamentary discussion that ""the approach of major sporting events — firstly, to a lesser extent, the Rugby World Cup in 2023, and then the Olympic Games in 2024 — means that we have to think ahead and anticipate the situation, thanks to a policy of decluttering.""
While the removal of homeless people from Paris might be controversial, the city's public spaces have also become home to another living creature that is universally unwelcome: bedbugs.
Numbers of punaises de lit have been increasing for several years in Paris, where one in 10 people have experienced infestations in the last five years, according to official figures. But this summer's annual spike is the highest yet.
And, even worse, it got traction on social media, with videos claiming to show the insects in beds and sofas at home, on public transport, and even in cinemas — although the reports remain unconfirmed.

Nevertheless, French authorities and Olympic organizers are concerned not only about the hygienic aspect but mainly about the psychological effect of a perceived infestation and the damage to the city's image ahead of the Olympics.
One place that organizers hope will be absolutely free of bedbugs is the new Olympic Village which is nearing completion in the Paris suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis. It is set to host 22,500 Olympians and Paralympians during the Games.
The future use of Olympic villages is a key question when it comes to the social legacy of any Games, and Paris 2024 is no different. Authorities have insisted that the village will be sustainable and environmentally friendly, having been fitted with geothermal heating and cooling systems to reduce the need for air conditioning.
But community groups are still worried about issues such as air pollution (only one of four proposed new metro connections has been completed) and affordability of housing after the Games, with flats often beyond the price range of residents in the poorest region in mainland France.
The approaching Olympics have also seen a reemergence of the decades-old debate over the wearing of religious symbols, in particular veils, in French public life which is constitutionally secular.
While France will not allow its athletes to wear head coverings, the International Olympic Committee has said athletes will be allowed to wear a veil if they wish in the Olympic Village. Each sport's federation decides the rules for its own event.
US fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad is the most high-profile athlete to have worn the hijab at the Olympic Games. She won a bronze medal in Team Sabre at Rio 2016 wearing the head covering.

https://www.dw.com/en/eu-and-china-compete-with-global-investment-schemes/a-67227221,GLOBALIZATION,EU and China compete with global investment schemes 27.10.2023,"Two years ago, the European Union launched its ""Global Gateway"" initiative to open the door to the world and investment in developing countries and emerging markets. And this month, it launched the first Global Gateway Forum as a means of taking stock of developments with partners, providing motivation, and strengthening cooperation and exchange of ideas for new projects.
The EU originally set up its global investment scheme to compete with China's Belt and Road Initiative, which some call the New Silk Road. Over the past 10 years, the communist economy has invested some €900 billion ($948 billion) in infrastructure projects around the world. While the EU plans by 2027 to invest €300 billion only, in fewer countries. The bloc has about 60 partners for its Global Gateway scheme, whereas China has over 150.
""Global Gateway is about giving countries a choice, and a better choice,"" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the opening of the Forum on October 25 in Brussels, implying that the EU scheme was fairer and less bureaucratic than China's. ""Because for many countries around the world, investment options are not only limited, but they all come with a lot of small print, and a very high price."" She added: ""Our resilience is stronger when you, our friends, are also more resilient. We all win. That is why Europe has chosen to work closer with our partners.""
The EU's scheme is not as focused on transport and infrastructure as China's. Chinese investment has gone largely to expanding railway and road networks and to construct ports, helping to transport containers with goods from China more efficiently. The EU says it wants its global gateway to promote green and sustainable projects in areas such as energy, medicine, and education.
The scheme's first major project, with Ghana, Rwanda, Senegal and South Africa, was the construction of vaccine manufacturing hubs on the African continent in 2022. There are now 90 Global Gateway projects, worth some €66 billion. More deals were signed during the Forum in Brussels, although very few heads of government attended.
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina signed an agreement to develop renewable energies in her country with EU funding, while Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha secured commitments for the green transformation of Vietnam's energy industry.
The EU hopes through more agreements to secure access to minerals and rare earths in Asia and Africa.
The European Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) in Luxembourg, which plays a major role providing funds, examine all applications for potential Global Gateway projects. But a large bulk of the investment is also supposed to come from private European companies, which have more say than Chinese companies. ""We are mobilizing the financial firepower of Europe's leading companies,"" said von der Leyen in Brussels. ""The magic is in this public-private teamwork — through public funds, training and enabling regulation, we can provide the long-term predictability private investors need to start ambitious projects.""
German mechanical engineering companies, which dominate the European market, have welcomed the Global Gateway scheme and generally want to participate. Ulrich Ackermann from the VDMA, the largest network organization for the machinery and equipment manufacturing industry in Germany and Europe, said that it was important that projects be implemented rapidly. ""The EU should apply its principles: transparent calls for projects based on criteria of sustainability, upfront calculations of the return on investment, and measures to prevent corruption. Internationally recognized technical standards should apply. To provide a counterweight to the rightly criticized weaknesses of the Chinese 'Belt and Road' initiative,"" he said.
The Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper South China Morning Post recently suggested in an article that China could indirectly influence decisions by European companies. Since September, the EU has sought advice from a group of large companies, which are participating in the Global Gateway scheme, including Siemens, Volvo, Alstom, and Maersk, which all have business interests in China. For their part, Chinese companies hold large stakes in the Portuguese energy company EDP and the port of Antwerp, which are also serving on the advisory board.

European Commission officials have pointed out that Global Gateway is not exclusive. The goal is to gain freedom from China but not to decouple entirely. A country that takes part in Global Gateway is able to participate in China's Belt and Road Initiative at the same time. Bangladesh and Serbia are just two of the numerous countries doing this.
At last week's Belt and Road summit in Beijing, which was attended by 10,000 delegates, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that he could imagine working with the European initiative in some way. He said competition had to be accepted from a ""positive perspective"" and expressed a ""willingness"" to link the two schemes, ""to play out the advantages of both China and the West.""
Jean Saldanha, director of the Brussels-based Network for Debt and Development, which advocates for human-rights based financial and economic systems, said the Global Gateway did not put enough emphasis on human rights, good governance, and other such standards. ""How different is it from the Belt and Road Initiative?"" she asked on the sidelines of the forum. ""What it finally balls down boils down to is that Europe is trying to compete with China and nothing more than that.""
She said that time would tell but right now it was ""very difficult to see the differences.""

https://www.dw.com/en/will-the-hamas-israel-conflict-derail-saudi-arabias-ambitious-plans-for-its-future/a-67223432,BUSINESS,Will the Hamas-Israel conflict derail Saudi Arabia's ambitious plans for its future? 26.10.2023,"Five years ago, speaking in front of an attentive audience in the glitzy Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, said he believed the Middle East could be the ""new Europe.""
""The next global renaissance, in the next 30 years, will be in the Middle East,"" the autocratic leader said in 2018, at the second iteration of the Saudi-run investment conference the Future Investment Initiative, or FII.
""This is the Saudis' war. This is my war,"" he continued. ""I don't want to leave this earth before I see the Middle East at the forefront of the world.""
Bin Salman went on to present Vision 2030, a wildly expensive and ambitious plan to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil. At the time, his speech was met with applause and a standing ovation — despite the fact that many Western attendees had already withdrawn from the event over the murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi.
At this year's Future Investment Initiative, however, an actual war was weighing heavily on the meeting because the Israel-Hamas conflict and its consequences have the potential to disrupt the oil-rich Gulf state's visions for its future.
The investment conference in Saudi Arabia, which ran from Tuesday to Thursday, is the seventh iteration of the FII, often nicknamed ""Davos in the desert"" after the global summit of world leaders and bankers held annually in Davos, Switzerland.
Despite the ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza, around a thousand kilometers away, only a handful of attendees canceled, the organizers said.
In Riyadh this week were some of the world's best-known and wealthiest financiers. That included heads of leading investment funds and banks like BlackRock, Blackstone, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase. Deals worth billions were expected to be done during the event.
The first of those was announced on Tuesday: A $500 million (€470 million) plan for the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, or PIF, to invest in a car factory in Saudi Arabia together with South Korean automaker Hyundai.
It made sense to be there despite what was happening in Gaza, Karen E. Young, a senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, told DW.
""Investors paid a lot to attend the conference. [They] see Saudi and the PIF as a major source of investment and opportunity,"" she pointed out. ""There is simply interest to try and understand how the Gulf states and their sovereign funds will maneuver in this crisis.""
The topic of the latest Gaza conflict was not to be avoided, though.
After the Hamas militant group killed over 1,400 people in brutal terror attacks on Israel on October 7, the Israeli military has been bombing the Gaza Strip, one of the most densely populated places on earth. An estimated 6,000 Palestinians, almost half of them children, have so far been killed by the ongoing Israeli bombing, according to Hamas-run health authorities in Gaza. The death toll continues to rise.
What was currently going on in Gaza ""overshadows everything else,"" The Wall Street Journal quoted Saudi Arabia's Minister of Investment Khalid al-Falih as saying. ""But for their good and for the good of humanity, we have to keep the compass focused on the prosperity of our people."" 
Citibank chief executive Jane Fraser said it was hard not to be pessimistic given the circumstances, and BlackRock boss Larry Fink suggested fighting in Ukraine and Gaza would lead to greater societal insecurity and, therefore, less hope. That, in turn, would weigh heavily on consumer sentiment and eventually slow economic growth, he argued.
In the shorter term, the biggest potential economic problems the conflict in Gaza could cause involve oil and gas supply and prices, economists have said. In a worst-case scenario, in which the conflict spreads beyond Israel, oil prices could rise to as much as $150 a barrel, analysts at Bloomberg wrote this week. Prices are currently at around $90 a barrel. This would lead to more inflation and slow growth.
Other more immediate risks include increased refugee flows, rising insurance costs and a threat to countries in the region dependent on tourism income.
Another project at risk is the recently announced India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, or IMEC, a trade corridor that would link India to Europe via the Middle East.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Israel have all signed a memorandum of understanding on the trade corridor, as have a number of European countries and India.
This would not have previously been possible because of bad relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. But before October 7, a normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel appeared to be coming closer. Normalizing with Israel fits in with Saudi Arabia's future plans because it would allow access to Israeli technology, a possible defense deal with the United States and potential permission for its own civilian nuclear program.
The IMEC would also play an important part in closer cooperation with Israel, and the Saudis had already pledged to spend $20 billion (€19 billion) on the new trade route.
""The efficient flow of goods and capital across the western Indian Ocean to the eastern Mediterranean is a geopolitical game changer that could involve other nations in the future,"" Michaël Tanchum, a senior fellow at the Austrian Institute for European and Security Policy, told DW about IMEC. 
However, after the October 7 attacks and the start of Israel's bombing, Saudi Arabia said it was halting the Israel normalization process.
And the IMEC could become collateral damage, Herve Delphin, the European Union's envoy to India, told Indian media this week. ""The question is whether it's a temporary collateral or permanent collateral,"" he said, adding that this would depend on whether the conflict escalates.
But will any of this put a permanent dent in Saudi Arabia's ambitious plans?
The Saudi crown prince has previously argued that regional stability is necessary to achieve Vision 2030. And ""the war is a threat to his vision of a new Middle East, as a center of outgoing investment, of integrated tourism and trade,"" Young agreed.
But like many other observers, Young also believes that while the Saudi-Israel normalization process is stalled due to the Gaza conflict, it is not dead.
""Israel and Saudi Arabia still have shared interests, especially in seeing Iran as a threat,"" she explained. ""The tension for Saudi Arabia now is balancing its domestic public opinion with its economic diversification and regional aspirations. That was true before October 7 and is even more challenging now.""
On the second day of the FII, Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told conference attendees that his country didn't want the Gaza conflict to derail Saudi plans. ""So we are making a lot of efforts with our partners to make sure we go back to where we were,"" he said.
""The Saudi leadership understands that the Palestinian cause still weighs in its domestic and international clout, in its bargaining with the US, and its rivalry with other Islamic players,"" Yasmine Farouk, a nonresident scholar in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace wrote earlier this month.
Despite this, Farouk concludes, the Saudis are likely to be more pragmatic in the near future and will lean towards building a regional consensus.
""The last thing that Saudi Arabia wants is such a regional disorder that disrupts the progress of its Vision 2030 megaprojects and development plans,"" she concluded.

https://www.dw.com/en/vera-politkovskaya-no-one-in-russia-values-my-moms-legacy/a-67216812,CONFLICTS,Vera Politkovskaya: No one in Russia values my mom's legacy 26.10.2023,"Vera Politkovskaya, the daughter of murdered Russian journalist, human rights activist and Vladimir Putin critic Anna Politkovskaya, has released a new book. The German version is titled ""Meine Mutter hätte es Krieg genannt,"" which roughly translates to ""My mother would have called it war."" The book was co-authored with Sara Giudice.
Anna Politkovskaya became a well-known figure in the 1990s when she worked as a reporter for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, especially for her reporting from the northern Caucasus region. Politkovskaya dedicated much of her career to covering the Second Chechen War. She was killed on October 7, 2006, in Moscow.
The title of Vera Politkovskaya's latest book alludes to Russia's war in Ukraine, which in Russia is referred to merely as a ""special military operation.""
Politkovskaya moved to Italy after Russia invaded Ukraine, where she now works as a freelance journalist. DW spoke with her at the Frankfurt Book Fair.
DW: How and when did you decide to write your book?
Vera Politkovskaya: In our family, we thought for years about how much is known about my mother's work, how she stayed in Chechnya and what she wrote about. At the same time, little is known about her personality. My mother's life was not only about work. There was also another side that almost no one knew. We often spoke about how good it would be if one of us described this other side of her. When I was offered to write this book, I immediately said yes.
What was your mother like?
She was difficult because a simple person would hardly be able to perform and endure the kind of work she did. She had a rather complicated personality, which showed itself at work and among the family. As children, my brother and I often experienced our mother's very clear ideas of how our lives should develop. Our education was very close to her heart, and it was vital to her. And, of course, there were disagreements because we were teenagers and wanted to do other things.

What did you think about your mother's work at Novaya Gazeta when you were young? Did you support her?
I was a kid in the early 1990s and then a teenager. I was busy with my own life, so I can't say I paid close attention to her work. My mother began focusing on Chechnya in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Then, she encountered her first problems concerning her security. She knew what she was doing. For us, the main consequences of her work were that she sometimes discussed safety concerns with us and urged us to be careful.
DW: In your book, you write that your mother suspected she could die…
Yes, that began after her colleague Yuri Shchekochikhin died. He was poisoned. After that, my mother strangely began talking about how it must be a beautiful death if she were killed as Yuri Shchekochikhin was, should that be her fate. She said it would be nice if it were a poisoned bouquet of roses. She said she would hold the bouquet, take a deep breath and die a beautiful death for a woman.
But jokes aside, there were discussions about how she wanted to be buried, what to do when she died, where she kept all the documents and money in the house. Of course, we did not discuss this often, but it was a topic.
DW. What was your first thought that came to your mind when you learned that Russia had attacked Ukraine?
It came as a shock. Although the Western media had warned this would happen, of course, I did not want to believe it would. A few days before the war began, there was that famous speech by Putin (in which he declared the recognition of the independence of the ""Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics""). When I heard that speech, I realized war would come.
Nevertheless, the scale of this war was hard to comprehend. The first rational thought that came to me after the war began — and after recovering a little from the shock — was that I must leave the country. If we — and by we, I mean Russia — were teetering on the brink of an abyss all this time, we have plunged into it now.
DW: What has to happen for public opinion in Russia to change?
According to independent sociological studies, no more than 30% of the Russian population supports this war. And I think that's accurate. The people don't want war. Support for Putin is a different problem. Some people in Russia believe that nobody other than Putin can rule such a vast country with so many issues. I won't criticize these people, but of course, I think they are wrong.
It is clear that the system that is in place in Russia will not disappear as long as Putin is there, and everything will continue in this spirit. Most likely, he will remain in power until 2036. But people are wrong to think that once Putin is gone, we will immediately get a wonderful, modern Russia. There will be no rapid change after his departure. New significant problems will arise In 2036 when he's gone.
A power struggle will erupt that will most likely be bloody and ruthless. Then Russia will be unstable for years, and only after many more years, in the best case, will someone reasonable come to power. Do you realize what time frame we are talking about? I don't know if I will live to see it.
DW: Your mother's book ""In Putin's Russia"" and her articles predicted many things that came to pass after her death, including that the wars in Chechnya are only the beginning and what Putin's rule would lead to. Why were her warnings not taken seriously in Russia or the West?
People who read her works at that time in Russia and the West believed she was greatly exaggerating. But as history has shown, none of it was exaggerated.
What legacy did your mother leave behind?
To call things as they were. To realize that you are not wrong just because you're in the minority. And to act according to your own perspective and your own assessment of the situation. If we are talking about her legacy in journalism, I hope that it will be honored somewhere outside Russia. But this I can say with certainty: No one in Russia values her legacy.

https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-whats-drawing-german-firms-to-a-war-torn-country/a-67216145,BUSINESS,Ukraine: What's drawing German firms to a war-torn country 26.10.2023,"At first, it may seem paradoxical: Ukraine has been at war since February 2022, fighting Russian aggression with no end in sight. At the same time, there's mounting interest among German companies in doing business with the war-torn country in eastern Europe.
Currently, more German companies seem drawn by the prospect of substantial deals as the war's destructions are immense, and Ukraine's reconstruction will cost massive sums. The Ukrainian government estimates the country needs $750 billion (€709 billion) by 2032. Some experts expect Ukraine's reconstruction needs to be much higher, somewhere in the region of $1 trillion.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has promised that those who invest now will achieve ""a good return after the war."" Zelensky's reasoning is that the more and the sooner foreign companies engage in Ukraine, the better the prospects for the country's economic development would be. After a steep decline in Ukraine's gross domestic product (GDP) due to the war, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is anticipating a growth rate of 2% in 2023 accelerating to 3.2% in the coming year.
At a recent German-Ukrainian economic conference in Berlin, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised his government's support for German companies willing to engage in Ukraine. ""Those who invest in Ukraine today are investing in a future EU member state, which will be part of our legal community and our internal market,"" he told conference participants.
Germany is willing to offer state investment and export guarantees to minimize risks for companies. Even damages resulting from combat actions will be covered. Already before the war has ended, Berlin has granted fourteen investment guarantees totaling €280 million ($296 million).
Altogether 30 project proposals are currently being evaluated, and 70 more project ideas are on the table, according to Christian Bruch, deputy chairman of the German Eastern Business Association. Insurance solutions for transport through Ukraine are still needed, he told DW.
Before the war, about 2,000 German companies were doing business with and in Ukraine, and most have not given up. Not surprising, according to Chancellor Scholz, who hailed opportunities for doing business ""not only in the energy sector, such as in hydrogen, but also in the supply industry, agriculture, IT sector, and critical raw materials.""
One of the first to heed the German government's call to invest is chemical giant Bayer which produces seeds in Ukraine. Oliver Gierlichs, Managing Director of Bayer Ukraine says Ukraine's reconstruction ""has already started.""
The German corporation is planning to expand its subsidiary with €60 million. ""This is not a political decision, not a gift to Ukraine, but a purely economic decision, as we see great opportunities in agriculture. For export and also locally because Ukraine will remain the breadbasket of Europe,"" he told DW. Gierlich says Bayer works in a region ""where the risk of war is relatively low.""
""We have, of course, taken this into account. There is no zero risk, but from our point of view, it is manageable,"" he said.
Florian Otto, a leading analyst at Control Risks, a global consultancy, agrees. He says that the risks in Ukraine must be ""considered regionally."" In the embattled east and southeast of Ukraine, there are ""extreme risks"" that require a different management. ""In the rest of the country … Ukrainian companies are not only functioning but also displaying an astonishing degree of resilience and adaptability,"" he told DW.
In the course of the war, Russia increasingly targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure destroying power plants, power grids and water supply systems. The German government has recently approved a grant of almost €80 million for urgent repairs in these sectors.
The most lucrative business, however, is arms and ammunition supply to the Ukrainian army.
Germany has provided €24 billion for civilian and military aid to Ukraine so far, making it the second-largest supporter of Ukraine behind the United States. An additional €1.4 billion is budgeted for the winter including another Patriot defense system, the Iris-T air defense system, and more Gepard anti-aircraft tanks with newly manufactured ammunition.
German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall is extensively involved in this business. The company has recently registered a joint venture with the Ukrainian state-owned company Ukrainian Defense Industry JSC. Services and maintenance, assembly, production, and development of military vehicles are initially agreed to be carried out ""exclusively on Ukrainian territory,"" a company spokesperson told DW. ""The intention is to gradually build up joint capabilities in arms technology in Ukraine.""
Dennis Bürjes, a member of the management board at arms manufacturer Flensburger Fahrzeugbau (FFG), also told DW that business with Ukraine ""is growing."" The company, located near the Danish border, manufactures armored vehicles and employs 1,600 people.
FFG is in the process of contributing nearly 700 armored vehicles to the Ukrainian war effort, including bridge-laying tanks, recovery tanks, and engineer tanks. The company was already involved in arms deliveries ""when it was not yet politically opportune to deliver combat tanks,"" said Bürjes.
During a recent visit to FFG, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg praised the company for being ""the largest supporter in Europe when it comes to the quantity of armored vehicles for Ukraine.""
FFG has now set up a subsidiary in Ukraine ""with the aim of not only delivering vehicles but also servicing them sustainably, ideally together with Ukraine as a team,"" Bürjes, who is heading the subsidiary, said.
Doing business with and in Ukraine, however, is fraught with many problems. For example, what should machinery manufacturers do if the technology they've delivered to Ukraine doesn't work properly or needs repair? Then, there is a travel warning for Ukraine, entailing uninsured risk for companies wanting to send staff to the country.
Oleksandr Kamyshin, Ukraine's minister of strategic industries, takes a pragmatic approach to such complex issues. 
Kamyshin, who in his previous job as CEO of Ukraine's national railway famously kept the country's trains running through the war, points to online video conferences as one solution.
""When I used to work for the railway, we did extensive repairs on a train only via video conference,"" he told DW, adding that this particular train is still working without any problems.
Technical assistance can be provided through the internet, he noted, adding: ""War and COVID have taught us how to be resilient.""

https://www.dw.com/en/us-trump-fined-10000-for-violating-court-gag-order/a-67216839,POLITICS,"US: Trump fined $10,000 for violating court gag order 25.10.2023","Former US President Donald Trump was fined $10,000 (€9,500) for violating a gag order during a court appearance in a New York fraud trial Wednesday. 
Trump allegedly told one of Judge Arthur Engoron clerk's during a trial break: ""This judge is a very partisan judge, with a person who's very partisan sitting beside him, perhaps even much more partisan than he is.""
Engoron called Trump's statement a ""blatant"" violation of his gag order.
The gag order, which bars Trump from insulting court staff, was handed down on October 3 by Engoron, who is overseeing Trump's civil fraud trial.
It is the second time Trump has violated the gag order. Just last week, Trump was fined $5,000 for violating the order for the first time after leaving a social media post online maligning the judge's principal law clerk. 
After his court appearance, Trump addressed reporters and disparaged his former attorney and confidant, Michael Cohen, calling him a proven liar.
Cohen has testified that he was given an incentive to cook up numbers that would bolster his former boss' claims, saying he and other associates made sure the figures came out to, ""whatever number Mr. Trump told us.""
Cohen served three years in jail after pleading guilty to tax fraud, campaign finance violations and perjury.
Among other things, Cohen was convicted of trying to cover up hush money payments Trump made to former adult film star Stephanie Clifford, more recognizable by her screen name, Stormy Daniels. Trump and Daniels had an affair, which he sought to hide during his 2016 candidacy before being elected president.
Trump's lawyers have attacked Cohen's credibility and grilled the former fixer, who took the stand for the second day in a trial that could drive the real estate mogul out of business in New York.

Judge Engoron has already found Trump and his business fraudulently inflated and deflated the value of properties depending on whether he was dealing with investors or tax authorities.
Trump, far and away the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for the 2024 presidential election, has denied any wrongdoing.
The New York case, one of several legal battles Trump is entangled in, regards damages sought by New York Attorney General Letitia James.
The non-jury trial will be decided by Engoron and could see the former businessman fined $250 million, bar he and his sons Eric and Don Jr from doing business in New York and impose a five-year ban on Trump and the Trump Organization from dealing in commercial real estate.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-north-sea-ship-collision-leaves-5-dead/a-67194537,CATASTROPHE,Germany: North Sea ship collision leaves 5 dead 25.10.2023,"Two cargo ships collided in the North Sea off the coast of Germany on Tuesday, approximately 22 kilometers southwest of Helgoland Island and 31 kilometers northeast of Langeoog Island, emergency services said. 
German Central Command for Maritime Emergencies (CCME) said that the two freighters involved in the collision were named the Polesie and the Verity, the smaller of the two vessels, which sank after the collision. 
One dead body was pulled from the water near the collision site after the accident, whereas two people were rescued, according to the German Maritime Search and Rescue Service (DGzRS).
An hours-long search for four missing sailors from the smaller Verity vessel was called off on Wednesday morning. The CCME said later Wednesday that the four missing sailors were presumed dead. 
CCME chief Robby Renner told German media that there was ""no hope"" of finding the four missing sailors alive. 
The British-flagged Verity was en route from Bremen in Germany to Immingham in England. The Verity was carrying steel and it had 1,300 cubic meters of diesel on board, the spokesperson said.
CCME chief Renner added Wednesday that around 90 liters of diesel fuel had so far leaked from the wrecked ship. 
The collision happened in a very busy area for shipping, a spokesperson for Germany's Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency said Tuesday. 
Central Command Spokesman Benedikt Spangardt told the Tagesschau news program Tuesday that they were no longer receiving a signal from the Verity ship, which led them to assume it had sunk.
Several vessels — including a cruise ship in the area — and a German navy helicopter assisted in the search and rescue operations.
Meanwhile, the Polesie, registered in the Bahamas, is still afloat with 22 crew members on board. It was traveling from Hamburg to La Coruna in Spain.
Germany's Transport Minister Volker Wissing expressed his sympathy to crew members, family members and rescue teams.
Emergency tugs and divers had also been deployed to look for signs of life from the four missing crew members of the Verity, a spokesperson for the Central Command said. 
The search took place amid ""relatively challenging weather conditions"", DGzRS spokesman Christian Stipeldey said Tuesday.

https://www.dw.com/en/footballs-voss-tecklenburg-and-germany-an-awkward-divorce/a-67197848,SPORTS,Football's Voss-Tecklenburg and Germany: An awkward divorce 24.10.2023,"The fallout from Germany's shock first round exit at the World Cup and the position of its coach, Martina Voss-Tecklenburg, is threatening to become a saga.
Germany's women's coach since 2018, Voss-Tecklenburg was widely expected to step down or be fired after they limped out of a World Cup in which they considered themselves among the favorites.
Instead, following the team's return from Australia and New Zealand, the German Football Association (DFB) announced that she was off sick from September 8, and since mid-October has been on a period of vacation, approved by the DFB.
On October 19, Voss-Tecklenburg was seen in public for the first time again when she gave a guest ""celebratory lecture"" to dentists at the Bavarian Dental Association.
Her surprise appearance is a bizarre twist in what appears to be a long goodbye to the woman who guided Germany to the final of Euro 2022, when England were crowned champions.
Her lecture — ""Shaping to perform: my management in women's soccer"" — was seemingly unknown to the DFB until they commented on Sunday, keen to get to the root of the problem.
""The DFB has taken note of Voss-Tecklenburg's appearance at the Bavarian Dentists' Day,"" the statement read. ""A joint discussion is to take place immediately after the end of the vacation.""
Voss-Tecklenburg, 55, had already given a talk on team building and coaching on October 11 in Bremen at a forum organized by the German Association of the Prefabricated Housing Industry, which largely flew under the radar. 
Lena Oberdorf, the Germany and Wolfsburg midfielder, questioned the wisdom of Voss-Tecklenburg's decision to make these public appearances having failed to properly address the team's World Cup performance.
""It raises a few question marks for me,"" Oberdorf said in Frankfurt on Monday ahead of Friday's Nations League match against Wales.
""I would have wished for something different. For example, we could first clarify what happened at the World Cup and then she could go on vacation.""
Asked whether the coach should return, Oberdorf said she did not have the ""power"" to make such a decision.
""I'm just here to do my job. The DFB will take care of everything else.""
The DFB has been quiet on the matter though, with President Bernd Neuendorf evasive last Friday when asked about the situation at a press conference with interim national coach Horst Hrubesch and DFB managing director Andreas Rettig.
The matter was ""on hold,"" Neuendorf said. ""We hope she recovers well, that she gets well quickly.""
Rettig was equally cautious about Voss-Tecklenburg, whose contract runs until 2025: ""We also have to be prepared in case there is no return.""
In a further sign that their relationship is beyond repair, Voss-Tecklenburg reportedly only communicates with the governing body via lawyers.
Assistant coach Britta Carlsen took charge of the team in September for a 2-0 Nations League defeat by Denmark and a 4-0 victory over Iceland, which put them back in the hunt for a top-two position in their group and qualification for the 2024 Olympics.
Amid the instability, there is a veneer of hope for Germany though. Since Hrubesch, who was in charge of Germany's women's team for eight months in 2018, returned as interim coach earlier this month, there has been an uptick in the mood in the camp, according to Oberdorf.
""He has brought back the joy we've been missing for the past few games,"" the 21-year-old said of Hrubesch, whose first game in charge will be against Wales in Sinsheim, followed by a trip to Iceland on October 31.
""We have a clear mission and with Horst Hrubesch we also have a good coach at our side. I've only heard good things about him... we want to show the football we can play.""
As Germany piece together the wreckage after their World Cup humiliation, Hrubesch appears to be in pole position for the role on a permanent basis – with Germany's performances in October's games key to whether he will lead the team into their final two group games in December and potentially the Nations League playoffs next year.
""I think the DFB must decide how this is deciced. It is none of my business,"" said Hrubesch, a Bundesliga and European Cup winner as a player with Hamburg. ""I am concentrating on these two games and hope that it will be four in the end — plus the two in the playoffs.""
Despite the uncertainty, one thing appears certain — there is no way back for Voss-Tecklenburg at the DFB.",Business
https://www.dw.com/en/global-efforts-to-halt-deforestation-falling-short-report/a-67193557,NATURE AND ENVIRONMENT,Global efforts to halt deforestation falling short — report 24.10.2023,"The global effort to halt deforestation by 2030 is faltering, with a 4% increase in forest loss recorded in 2022 compared to 2021, according to an environmental report released on Tuesday.
""The world's forests are in crisis,"" said Erin Matson, a lead author of the Forest Declaration Assessment, an annual report by a coalition of environmental organizations. ""The opportunity to make progress is passing us by.""
In 2021, over 100 countries pledged to reverse forest degradation by 2030. The pledge also saw businesses and investors publicly commit to ending global deforestation and restoring up to 350 million hectares of degraded land by 2030.
However, the world is now 21% behind the target with 6.6 million hectares of forests lost in 2022, with most being primary forests in tropical regions.
Matson warned the 2030 goal is ""essential for maintaining a livable climate for humanity.""
""Since the baseline of 2018 to 2020, we're going in the wrong direction,"" she added.
The efforts are falling short with ""an area of tropical forest the size of Denmark has been lost"" since the global pledge was made, according to Fran Price, global forest lead for the environmental NGO the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF).
""The world is failing forests with devastating consequences on a global scale,"" Price added.
According to environmental group Climate Focus, some of the main causes of forest degradation include logging activities, livestock grazing, and road construction.
With the uptick in deforestation, the world would need to see a reduction of 27.8% by the end of this year to stay on track with current goals, according to Matson.
Experts from the report warned that the yearly $2.2 billion (€2.06 billion) allocated for forest protection projects is significantly less than the required investment.
They also called for the discontinuation of subsidies in sectors such as agriculture that contribute to deforestation.
On the positive side, 50 nations, including Brazil, Indonesia, and Malaysia, are progressing towards ending deforestation. The report praised the European Union's new regulations aimed at preventing the imports of commodities that drive deforestation.
""Hope isn't lost,"" Franziska Haupt, a lead author of the report said. ""These countries set clear examples that others must follow.""
The report comes before countries meet for crucial climate talks next month.

https://www.dw.com/en/cameroons-ghost-town-days-how-residents-cope-in-lockdown/a-67110298,CONFLICTS,Cameroon's 'ghost town' days: How residents cope in lockdown 23.10.2023,"It's 10 a.m. on a Monday in the Mile 2 Nkwen locality of Bamenda, a city in northwestern Cameroon. The streets are empty.
Mondays are ""ghost town"" days in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon that became engulfed in a separatist crisis some seven years ago. 
In many communities, everyone is expected to stay home. Markets are closed, offices locked, and the streets deserted.
The separatists who took up arms against the government in Yaounde enforce the Monday lockdowns. Residents risk being attacked, kidnapped or shot if they disobey.
The separatists hope to mount pressure on the central government to make concessions for the Anglophone community in the country by stopping all economic activity once a week.
Cameroon has been plagued by fighting since English-speaking separatists launched a rebellion against the government in 2017. The dissidents say they want the region to secede from the area dominated by the French-speaking majority and aim to create an independent, English-speaking state.
As a way out of the isolation and boredom of ""ghost towns,"" residents are finding new ways to network and support each other.
There are social and sports clubs, credit and thrift schemes, choirs or salons to stay active. 
In Bamenda, one economic network benefits all members. Financial contributions  are saved, pooled and paid out on a rotational basis to individual members.
The ""Prosperous Neighbors"" social network president, Ambechi Louis, says that despite the difficult security situation, members are finding ways to remain hopeful.
""We use Mondays for our meeting days because we used to hold them on Sundays, and people often had other commitments. Since Mondays are a free day in the region, more people can participate,"" Louis tells DW.
Carine belongs to a social network group for women only. Mondays are her chance to get to know her neighbors better since everyone is busy throughout the rest of the week, she says.
""We are into neighbor solidarity and many others like veteran sporting clubs. Monday is a day to be home, so we want to use that to exercise, participate in online groups, wash clothes, meet friends and socialize,"" Carine tells DW.
Pubs in several communities are cashing in on the ""ghost town"" days. On Mondays, some pubs even apply a members-only policy and decline to serve drinks to anyone outside of their communities.
One pub owner, known as ""Spice Boy,"" says strangers aren't allowed entry for security reasons. Any resident of the community will, however, be served.
""The days that the sales are [good] are Mondays,"" he tells DW. ""The reason is simple: We have meetings that have all been moved from Sundays to Mondays, and after these meetings, [people] come to drink and socialize.""
""Spice Boy"" says a normal day can bring in about €50-70 ($53-73), but a ""ghost town"" day can net double. 
""Mondays can be very boring, and to end the boredom, people come to drink,"" he said.

But some analysts are worried about the prevailing situation of the ""ghost towns"" and the implications for the economic activities in the region.
""You see, 'ghost towns' are very bad for the economy. Bamenda, for example, has lost its place as the fastest growing city in the sub-region,"" Stephen Nsum, an economist and a Bamenda-based university lecturer, told DW.
He believes that if the phenomenon isn't eliminated, it could plunge more people into poverty.
""Thousands have been laid off from their jobs because salaries can't be paid. Investors have pulled out of the two Anglophone regions, and even the biggest state employer after the public service is on its knees,"" Nsum said.
""If ghost towns are ended, there is hope the region shall gradually return to its part to economic recovery,"" he added.
The English-speaking regions of Cameroon remain conflict zones, with lives lost, properties destroyed, and the humanitarian crisis worsening.

https://www.dw.com/en/israel-hamas-conflict-dead-find-peace-at-makeshift-morgue/a-67174389,POLITICS,Israel-Hamas conflict: Dead find peace at makeshift morgue 23.10.2023,"At the edge of the Shura military base in central Israel, about a dozen containers are lined up next to several tents. The atmosphere is busy but quiet — out of respect for the deceased. 
At this makeshift morgue, doctors, forensic experts and volunteers in hazmat suits have been working around the clock to identify bodies, both of soldiers and civilians. The smell of death hangs in the air.
""The things we saw, we will never forget them,"" said Dr. Danielle, a volunteer dentist who could not give her last name under military rules. She was speaking with a group of reporters who were given access to the area by the Israeli military. ""We are working day and night in shifts trying to identify each and everyone.""
Most of the victims are from the initial terror attacks on southern communities in Israel on October 7, when Hamas militants breached the border. 
Two weeks later, some 100 to 200 people remain unaccounted for, with bodies still being found, the Israeli military said on October 19. Some areas near the Gaza border have not been accessible until now. At least 1,400 people have been killed in Israel since the war began, most in the initial attacks. Over 5,000 Palestinians have died in retaliatory airstrikes by the Israeli military on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.
""We are here doing what is a holy mission for us, identifying the last casualties and all of the civilians that got killed,"" said Dr. Danielle. ""It is so important for us. We want to give them their final respect.""

The identification process takes time, said the doctor. Many bodies had been disfigured and mutilated, she said.
""The mission they gave us was to identify the casualties,"" she said. ""No doctor, no dentist was prepared for what they saw. [...] We saw things that were shocking to us. Women that were raped."" She and her colleagues went on to say that there were also signs that some people had been burned alive. Hamas has denied any accusations of abuse. 
Many of the victims were killed without any ID on them. This made the identification process extremely difficult.
In a large tent lit up by strong neon lights, several teams are working on each body to understand what happened to the person.
They also try to match DNA with samples brought by families who are still searching for their relatives. Once a match has been made, bodies are released as quickly as possible to enable the families to bury them according to Jewish tradition. 
""In a Jewish tradition, when a person is deceased, we read a prayer, the Kaddish, to uplift the soul to its final rest,"" said Colonel Haim Weisberg, head of the military's (IDF's) rabbinic department. ""In this incident, we will see people who will not be able to read Kaddish at all because none of their family members have survived this. We saw families, grandparents, parents and grandchildren, all came here in bags.""
 

Some families still don't know whether their loved ones were killed or abducted to Gaza by the militants. The Israel Defence Forces on Monday updated the number of hostages being held by Hamas to 222.
Giving clarity to the waiting families is the best they can do in this situation, said Dr. Danielle, before adding: ""As a nation, as us, we will never be the same again.""
This visit was facilitated by the Israeli military.

https://www.dw.com/en/kenya-president-ruto-pushes-for-locally-made-clothing/a-67162481,BUSINESS,Kenya: President Ruto pushes for locally-made clothing 23.10.2023,"President William Ruto has announced plans to spearhead an initiative that would ensure all military and police uniforms, as well as other clothing items, are exclusively produced within Kenya.
""I have already issued instructions going forward: All uniforms, shoes, and other pieces and items of clothing that are required by all our security services must be manufactured locally by our companies and made by our Kenyan young people,"" Ruto said at the recent passing-out parade of 2,664 forest rangers.
Kenya's textile companies, cotton farmers, garment workers, small businesses and the public reacted with excitement and optimism. Many expect the initiative to revitalize the country's struggling textile industry and have positive ripple effects on the overall economy.
Nairobi-based fashion designer Amos Mwangi sees the move as an opportunity as fashion in Kenya is changing:  ""People are starting to embrace what we call signature. So, it's a good thing,"" Mwangi said.

Kenya currently relies on textile imports, with over 90% coming from countries such as China, India, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Turkey. But investment and finance expert Caroline Karugu believes there's no need to import fabrics when Kenya can produce them. 
""What I am wearing is made here in Kenya — my jacket is made in Kawangware. These fabrics need not be imported,"" Karugu told DW.
Tejal Dodhia, the CEO of Thika Cloth Mills, has invested in advanced machinery to meet growing demand. She, too, can now envision a future without such a high rate of imports. 
""Everyone knows how important this is ... I hope the country will treasure this [initiative]. Let's all push to buy Kenya, build Kenya,"" Dodhia told DW.

However, the president's new directive raises questions over whether Kenya can meet most of the local demand for textile products. Beyond army boots and police uniforms, most staples, like elsewhere in the world, come from textile manufacturers, mainly in Southeast Asia.
""As much as we would like to buy products made in Kenya, they are not all available here. So, some of the products will have to maybe come from China or India,"" consumer Anne Mutiso Mwikali told DW.
Dodhia hopes her business, which is already running at full capacity, can become a catalyst in furthering Kenyan brands in textile sectors dominated by imports. She is confident her investment will pay off.
""If we don't put in the new machines now, we will not be able to cater to the market demands.""

Kenya's booming used clothing sector poses another challenge to these changes. Each year, the country imports close to 200,000 tons of second-hand items. 
But Phyllis Wakaiga of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers sees opportunities for growth and development, suggesting that used clothing traders could shift their focus to locally-made clothing. 
""We have an opportunity where we're able to sell these goods in our local market. So, they would replace the product [used clothes] and sell the locally manufactured goods,"" Wakaiga told DW.

https://www.dw.com/en/greta-thunberg-faces-backlash-for-pro-palestinian-post/a-67172344,POLITICS,Greta Thunberg faces backlash for pro-Palestinian post 21.10.2023,"Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg has faced strong backlash for a social media post made Friday in support of people in Gaza.
Thunberg posted a photo of herself and three others holding signs stating: ""Free Palestine,"" ""Climate Justice Now,"" ""This Jew stands with Palestine"" and ""Stand with Gaza"". In the caption, she called for ""solidarity with Palestine and Gaza"" and an immediate cease-fire to the Israel-Hamas conflict. The picture was posted on Instagram and X (formerly known as Twitter).
Thunberg was criticized for what detractors called her lack of solidarity with Israel or acknowledgment of the October 7 attacks by Hamas, which killed about 1,400 people. Hamas has been designated a terror organization by the EU, US, Israel and other governments.
The climate activist was sharply condemned for something in the photo, as well: a blue stuffed animal octopus, which sat in the corner near her shoulder.
Some X users said the plush toy resembled a ""Kraken,"" an antisemitic hate symbol meant to depict Jews as an octopus with arms encircling the world. Anti-Jewish cartoons frequently depicted the symbol in Nazi Germany, and it is still a common trope used by hate groups.
Thunberg deleted the post, uploading a cropped version that no longer included the octopus.
The caption of the updated version read: ""It has come to my knowledge that the stuffed animal shown in my earlier post can be interpreted by some as a symbol for antisemitism, which I was completely unaware of,"" she wrote.
The climate activist, who has been open for years about being autistic, continued: ""The toy in the picture is a tool often used by autistic people as a way to communicate feelings. We are of course against every type of discrimination, and condemn antisemitism in all forms and shapes. This is non-negotiable. That is why I deleted the last post.""
Israel's official Twitter account was unsparing in its response to Thunberg's updated tweet: ""@GretaThunberg, Hamas doesn't use sustainable materials for their rockets which have BUTCHERED innocent Israelis. The victims of the Hamas massacre could have been your friends. Speak up.""
Thunberg, who was detained at a climate protest in London earlier this week, did not respond to Israel's message.
The climate activist also reposted an Instagram post from the Berlin-based organization Palestine Speaks calling for a general strike ""against the genozide (sic) in Gaza"" on Friday, referring to the Israeli military response, which Palestinian officials say has killed nearly 4,400 people and displaced tens of thousands. The post asked workers and business owners to take off or close Friday in solidarity ""with Palestinians in Palestine and around the world.""
On Friday, Israeli military spokesperson Arye Sharuz Shalicar told Politico that ""whoever identifies with Greta in any way in the future, in my view, is a terror supporter,"" adding that Thunberg is ""sweeping the terror of the Palestinians or Hamas and Islamic Jihad under the table as if it did not exist.""
He later apologized for his comments, telling the website in a follow-up statement: ""I spoke out of a deep sense of pain and my words do not reflect my personal views or those of the IDF."" 
This isn't the first time Thunberg has made statements about the conflict between Israel and Hamas on social media.
In 2021, following reported Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, Thunberg tweeted: ""Devastating to follow the developments in Jerusalem and Gaza. #SaveSheikhJarrah"" in response to a post made by the Canadian author Naomi Klein calling the Israeli strikes ""war crimes.""
Thunberg was criticized then for not condemning Hamas' previous reported attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip. 
She later posted: ""To be crystal clear: I am not 'against' Israel or Palestine. Needless to say, I’m against any form of violence or oppression from anyone or any part. And again — it is devastating to follow the developments in Israel and Palestine.""
Thunberg is known for getting into public spats over her political views, often with high-ranking politicians, on X.

https://www.dw.com/en/thailand-russia-relations-remain-strong-but-at-what-cost/a-67159703,POLITICS,"Thailand-Russia relations remain strong, but at what cost? 21.10.2023","Despite the West's best efforts to isolate Russia on the international stage following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow still enjoys warm relations with countries in Asia — Thailand being among them.
This past week, at the Belt and Road summit in Beijing, Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin hailed Thailand and Russia's ""long-standing close relationship"" after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Srettha posted about his first meeting with Putin as Thai PM on X, formerly known as Twitter. Both discussed increasing trade and cultural ties, he said, and Putin accepted Srettha's invitation to visit Thailand next year.
Experts say Srettha, who is a real estate tycoon, is just focusing on business.
""To boost the Thai economy to like 4%, and above, you need some foreign exchange. You need some customers. I think it's not like he's turned to Putin at the expense of the West. He wants to do both,"" Thitinan Pondsudhirak, a political analyst in Bangkok, told DW.
""While the social media backlash has taken the shine off his recent visit with Putin at the BRI Forum, Srettha cannot afford to be limited by optics only,"" said Mark S. Cogan, Associate Professor of Peace and Conflict Studies at Kansai University, Japan.
""Thailand is still heavily tourism dependent, and while not as much so as it is on Chinese tourism, Russian attraction and investment in Thailand cannot be ignored,"" he said.
Thailand has continued doing business with the Russia despite Moscow facing Western sanctions and political isolation following its February 24, 2022, invasion of Ukraine. Bangkok abstained from a UN vote to condemn Russia for its so-called annexation of four territories in Ukraine, too. Complicating matters further is the fact that Putin is also wanted by the International Criminal Court with The Hague having issued an arrest warrant in March of this year, ""in the context of the situation in Ukraine.""

The Beijing meeting between the two leaders came right after Bangkok announced it would extend the length of time Russian tourists can stay in the kingdom. From November 1, Russian visitors will be allowed to stay in Thailand for 90 days — up from 30 — with the scheme effective on a temporary basis until April 30. Thailand hopes the move will boost its economy.
Gary Bowerman, a tourism analyst based in Malaysia, says the decision ""makes sense.""
""Thailand hopes that by extending the welcome, more Russian tourists will spend more time exploring more of the country,"" he said.
Thailand has long been a popular holiday destination for Russian tourists. According to Thailand's Ministry of Sport and Tourism, nearly one million arrivals had already entered the Southeast Asian country by October 1. This means Russian tourists rank fifth among international visitors to enter the country this year. Authorities expect that number to grow to two million Russian visitors in 2024.
""It's not just the one million or more Russians that visit Phuket or other exotic destinations, but the real estate investments that in some ways stabilize tourism in Thailand by creating Russian enclaves in select neighborhoods, like Russian restaurants and other cultural familiarities,"" Cogan added.
As for trade, Russia is Thailand's 30th largest partner. Exports to Russia include vehicles, machinery, electronics, vegetables and fruit. Imports include oil, fertilizer and steel. Last year, Moscow pledged to increase bilateral trade with Thailand to $10 billion (€9.44 billion).
Titipol Phakdeewanich, a political scientist at Ubon Ratchathani University, says Thai-Russian relations don't appear to be changing under Srettha Thavisin, compared with his predecessors.
""I don't just look at Prayut [Chan-o-Cha], but I also look at Thaksin [Shinawatra] as well, because you know, Pheu Thai is Thaksin's Party... he had good relations with Russia. Thavisin, perhaps, is not much different from Prayut when he was in power, because Thailand didn't make any comments on the Ukraine situation.""
Srettha has been keen to boost Thailand's economy, one of the main campaign issues during the country's general election in May. But the Pheu Thai party's reputation took a hit from its supporters after forming a coalition that included pro-military parties in order to form a government.
""He only just thinks of economic policy and that is because that is the ticket that Pheu Thai is hoping to use to gain more popularity and change its reputation. If the economy is doing well, then they would have more opportunities to gain more seats in the next election,"" Titipol said.
To that end, Pheu Thai has also pledged to handout $10,000 Thai Baht (€259, $274) in digital money to every Thai citizen over 16-years of age. With a population of over 70 million, of which more than three-quarters fit into that age bracket, the move could prove costly.
""There is a big question about the source of money for their populist policies,"" Titipol said.

Allowing for more Russian tourism and investment is one way of producing further income for Thailand. ""By doing everything to show that they are also trying to generate more revenues for the government,"" Titipol said.
But with Russia's international reputation tarnished because of its war in Ukraine, Srettha cozying up to Putin may also come at a reputational cost, the political scientist added.
""I don't think this is good for Thailand's reputation as a supporter of democracy and human rights. And it will also destroy the reputation of his [Srettha's] government. He had a choice not to have that picture with Putin, but then it was his choice to actually show it. He doesn't really care about reputation and also indicated he doesn't quite understand geopolitics and how to actually balance and improve Thailand's reputation.""

https://www.dw.com/en/hamas-learning-about-drone-warfare-from-the-war-in-ukraine/a-67169578,POLITICS,Hamas: Learning about drone warfare from the war in Ukraine 20.10.2023,"Using military drones has been part of modern warfare for some time now. But Russia's war on Ukraine marked a new milestone in drone warfare. Remodeled commercial drones deemed inappropriate for combat until recently were used for targeted, large-scale attacks for the first time.
Military experts say Hamas terrorists used these types of drones to facilitate their October 7 attacks on Israeli border towns.
The militants deployed adapted commercial quadcopter drones developed by the Chinese firms DJI and Autel, they say.
Hamas wreaked serious strategic damage on the Israel Defense Forces in its October 7 attacks, which killed more than 1,400 people. Hamas is classified by the United States, the European Union, Israel and some Arab states as a terrorist organization.
Hamas video footage shows drones dropping explosive devices that disabled or ""blinded"" surveillance towers along Israel's entire border fence with the Gaza Strip. Until now, these structures were considered impenetrable.
To fully understand these attacks, it helps to look to the Ukraine war. Almost from the get-go in its 2022 invasion, Russia deployed commercial drones carrying explosive devices. These days, the weapons are used by both sides.
While in Russia's invasion of Ukraine these drones are used against soldiers and armored vehicles, Hamas used them on Israeli military infrastructure.
""The way Hamas has used drones is new. We haven't seen that before,"" Carlo Masala of the University of the Bundeswehr (the German Armed Forces) in Munich told the German news magazine Der Spiegel. Hamas terrorists closely copied methods used in Ukraine, he said.
Hamas propaganda videos also show drones dropping shells on an Israeli tank crew, even hitting a $3.5 million Merkava 4 tank, which at 63 tons is considered the world's heaviest in production.
Liran Antebi oversees high-tech programs and national security issues at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv. She has studied the deployment of drone technology in conflicts for over a decade and closely follows Russia's war against Ukraine. But even she was ""surprised by the unexpected and complex use of Hamas drones,"" she said.
""This proves that, even if they are technologically quite primitive, they can be much deadlier in a complex mission than we previously would have admitted,"" the researcher told DW.
The fact Hamas has drones at its disposal is nothing new. But the group clearly built up its arsenal ahead of the lethal assault on October 7.
Commercial drones are ""cheap, easy to snap up on the market and can be set off from anywhere in a few seconds along a precise route with virtually no prior knowledge,"" said drone technology expert Yair Ansbacher in comments to the Israeli business newspaper Globes. ""But the number and scale of the use of drones in the Middle East does not come close to that in Ukraine.""
Liran Antebi recalls that it was originally in the Middle East that such drones were converted for combat purposes — the Islamic State (IS) terrorist organization used very basic ones against US forces.
""Later we saw it in Ukraine, and now we see it here as well,"" Antebi said.
Hamas confirmed the use of 35 ""Zouari"" drones in the October 7 attacks. These drones, which are made by Hamas, are named after the former head of the terror group's drone program, Tunisian engineer Mohamed Zouari.
Zouari was killed in 2016. His death has been widely attributed to Mossad, Israel's national intelligence agency. 
Many experts are convinced that Hamas' entire weapons program is funded from abroad.
Iran transfers $100 million to the group every year, according to the US State Department's 2020 Country Terrorism Report. Hamas has never disputed this, but has said the amount is less.
According to the Washington Post newspaper, Iranian allies have supported Hamas terrorists with military training, logistical and financial aid. This information can however not be verified.
Some observers suspect that Russian forces could also be involved in the training of Hamas fighters.
""All of them — Islamic Jihad, Hamas and others — get trained in Syria. It is clear that Russians as trainers with unique experience are involved,"" Ihor Semyvolos, the director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies in Kyiv, told DW.
Russia is an ally of the Syrian regime but there is so far no evidence of direct Russian support for Hamas. Israeli journalist Nadav Eyal, however, reports that Russian weapons were left behind by Hamas fighters at the site of the October 7 terrorist attacks.
According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Iran has armed the Hamas assault unit Nukhba to the teeth with Russian-made weapons - from Kalashnikov assault rifles to Strela anti-aircraft missiles. 
""We have seen the direct and indirect consequences of the connection between Russia, Iran and Hamas on the streets and in the homes, in the once idyllic clearings of cities and towns in the areas bordering the Gaza Strip which now have become ruins,"" the paper’s columnist Yossi Melman writes.
There’s been no official Israeli statement on the issue. The military is currently preparing for a ground operation in the Gaza Strip.
Frank Ledwidge, a former British intelligence officer with experience in crisis areas, told DW that he expects the Israel-Hamas war to be a high-tech conflict ""with heavy use of drones, tunnels, artillery fire and air strikes.""
Security expert Liran Antebi suggests already paying attention to AI technologies available to the general public. She warns that in the near future, terrorist groups around the world might begin using them for deadly ends.

https://www.dw.com/en/nigeria-taps-into-the-global-lithium-market/a-67135006,BUSINESS,Nigeria taps into the global lithium market 18.10.2023,"Nigeria is tightening rules around mining its lithium minerals countrywide following the rush for it by foreign mining companies.
The government said no company would be allowed to mine and export raw lithium unless they set up processing and refining plants in Nigeria.
Dele Alake, Nigeria's Minister of Solid Materials, told DW that the government would ""do everything possible to discourage the carting away of our solid minerals without value addition.""
The much-coveted mineral lithium is used in the production of rechargeable batteries and electric vehicles. With discoveries of large lithium deposits in Nigeria, Africa's largest economy wants to profit from the billion-dollar global lithium market.
Lithium is currently mined in Nassarawa, Kogi, Kwara, Ekiti, and Cross River States.
The mineral is also being mined extensively in Zimbabwe, Africa's largest producer, as well as in Namibia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, and Ghana.
""I want to emphasize the fact that the era of exporting raw solid minerals from Nigeria is over. Any company wishing to come and invest in the solid minerals industrial sector in Nigeria henceforth must add local value,"" Alake said.
With new licensing requirements, mining companies must show business plans that benefit local communities before being granted licenses.
Alake said that the move is critical to help create jobs. ""I am glad to mention that such an initiative is already on stream as some companies have already commenced operations in Nigeria.""
Ganfeng Lithium Industry Ltd., a Chinese company, is building a lithium processing plant in the central Nasarawa state.

The plant is to process about 18,000 tons of lithium ore per day to manufacture batteries for electric vehicles. The government said this is an example of the desired type of investment.
Nigeria, Africa's top oil producer, is also rich in gold, limestone, and zinc, but its mining industry is underdeveloped. It contributes less than 1% to the country's gross domestic product.
The government wants to diversify the country's economy, shifting away from its massive reliance on oil.
But it is not only the revenue from lithium that is a focus for Nigerian authorities. They say they also want to ensure that the mineral isn't mined to the detriment of the environment.
They have already warned foreign nationals like the Chinese to avoid engaging in the illegal mining of lithium. 
Still, the government has previously been blamed for disregarding the impact of illegal mining of some other minerals across Nigeria.
The country's mining association said the federal government must crack down on illegal mining activities that destroy the environment.
Dele Anyoleke, president of the Miners Association of Nigeria, told DW that health and safety issues involved in mining newly discovered materials are not always addressed. In addition, ""whenever there is a discovery of a new mineral, all these artisanal miners would swing into such a place. They don't need to dig. They don't need to blast.""
He said governmental agencies often fail to end such activities.
According to some environmental experts, uncontrolled mining leads to environmental degradation with dire consequences for the population.
""When mining, you need to protect the environment. How do we protect the environment? There are five ways to make mining more sustainable: lower impact mining techniques, reusing mining waste, eco-friendly equipment, rehabilitating the mining site, and shutting down the illegal mining site,"" Nafisatu Mohammed Sani, a geological consultant in Abuja, told DW.
Minister of Solid Materials Alake said the mining industry is being modernized and that the government is investing more than $19.6 million (€18.6) over seven years to generate data on the mining sector through the National Integrated Mineral Exploration Project (NIMEP).
""The preliminary reports from this project have unraveled massive discoveries which have literally put Nigeria on the world map of lithium-rich countries,"" Alake told the gathering at the Nigeria Mining Week event this week.
The Nigerian government said that controlling mining and not having a repeat of events in the oil-rich Niger region — where oil activities destroyed the environment — is critical.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-more-women-join-executive-boards/a-67134587,BUSINESS,Germany: More women join executive boards 18.10.2023,"As old as the issue of gender equality for women in the professional world may be, it remains so urgent that just recently, the Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to a woman who researches this very topic.
The latest report by the AllBright Foundation, released on Wednesday, provides current insights into the situation of women in leadership positions. The result: there is some progress, but there's still a long way to go.
The Swedish-German nonprofit organization with headquarters in Stockholm and Berlin works to promote more women and diversity in executive business positions. This year's survey found that at least 37% of newly appointed board members were women in the past year.
""And finally, albeit quite late, we've reached a point where there are fewer all-male boards than mixed-gender ones,"" the two directors of the AllBright Foundation, Wiebke Ankersen and Christian Berg, wrote.
""I'm pleased that an increasing number of German companies are now promoting women to executive positions,"" said Sven Hagströmer, the initiator of the foundation.
However, Hagströmer, best known as the founder of Avanza Bank and investment company Creades, also said he suspects that companies are mainly trying to get out of public criticism by hiring more female board members. His suspicion was reinforced by the fact that the vast majority of German companies have only one woman on their executive boards.
Almost 83% of board members are men. In the German blue-chip stock index DAX, there are even two companies whose boards consist solely of men: Adidas and Porsche Holding — still an improvement over last year, when there were seven such companies.
For example, there are more female board members in the United States than Germany. AllBright figures show that women occupy over a third of seats there. When comparing 40 companies from France, the UK, Poland, Sweden, the US and Germany, Germany's businesses rank second to last.
AllBright said that to change ""boardroom dynamics"" and make a difference in company policy, women must take up at least one-third of board seats. In the US, this is the case for every second company, while in Germany, it's only valid for 28% of the 40 largest enterprises.
Surprisingly, American women are successful despite less favorable conditions than in Germany. There is no legal quota for women on executive boards, let alone paid parental leave and adequate and affordable childcare options. Apart from that, women in the US work less frequently. However, it's usually full-time when they do work, and they are more consistently promoted to leadership positions.
There is no legal quota in the UK either. Still, the business sector has set voluntary targets — with success, as the 350 largest listed companies achieved a 40% female representation on their boards three years earlier than planned. By 2025, they aim to have 40% women in the top two levels of leadership as well.
French women benefit from a legal quota for executive boards, which mandates that by 2026, at least 30% of board members must be women, increasing to 40% by 2029. In supervisory boards, the quota requires at least 40% female membership. Most French women work full-time and utilize state-provided childcare from an early age.

Germany remains entrenched in traditional gender roles, according to the AllBright report. While many women work, it's often in part-time jobs, making the path to executive positions challenging.
However, women are eager to take on more responsibility in their careers. ""Studies show that women are equally striving to obtain leadership positions. It's only that they often hit a 'glass ceiling,'"" said economist Marcel Fratzscher, referring to a colloquial term for the social barrier preventing women from being promoted to top jobs in management.
He noted that more German men would wish for equal opportunities for their female partners in the workplace and were willing to assume more family and childcare responsibilities.
That is why the AllBright directors Ankersen and Berg demand a faster and more consistent expansion of daycare centers and all-day schools in Germany. In addition, incentives like tax benefits for married women to work part-time should be abolished, and parental leaves should be more equally split between men and women.
If progress on gender equality in Germany continues at the pace of the past five years, the report said, it will take another 18 years for every second executive position in publicly listed companies to be held by a woman.

https://www.dw.com/en/molotov-cocktails-thrown-at-berlin-synagogue-police/a-67134803,POLITICS,Molotov cocktails thrown at Berlin synagogue — police 18.10.2023,"Attackers threw two Molotov cocktails at a synagogue and a Jewish community center in Berlin overnight, police said on Wednesday.
Following the attack, Chancellor Olaf Scholz vowed that the government would fight antisemitism in Germany.
The attack comes as a conflict rages between Israel and the Islamist militant group Hamas, which Germany, the EU and several other countries classify as a terrorist organization.
Berlin police said they were probing the attack in the city's Mitte district. There were no reports of injuries or damage.
The attack occurred around 3:45 a.m. local time (0145 GMT).
""Two unidentified people came on foot and threw two burning bottles filled with liquid in the direction of the synagogue on Brunnenstrasse,"" police said in a statement.
""The bottles landed on the pavement and broke, extinguishing the fire.""
After the attackers ran away, security forces managed to put out a small fire that had been left, ""preventing further consequences,"" according to the statement.
The Kahal Adass Jisroel group that runs the synagogue confirmed that ""people and the building, fortunately, were unharmed.""
Police said that a man attempted to approach the synagogue at around 8 a.m. and began shouting anti-Israel slogans after officers stopped him.
The man has been released, and a probe has been opened against him on charges of incitement of racial hatred and an attempted attack on an officer.
Germany's chancellor posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, condemning antisemitism without mentioning the Molotov cocktail incident specifically.
""Attacks against Jewish institutions, violent riots on our streets — this is inhumane, disgusting and cannot be tolerated,"" Scholz said.
""Antisemitism has no place in Germany. My thanks go to the security forces, especially in this situation,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Israel's embassy called for Germany to address antisemitic attacks with ""unwavering severity.""
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said that the protection of Jewish institutions in Germany had the ""highest priority"" and called the attack on Wednesday a ""despicable act.""
Berlin's Jewish Community called for solidarity with the targeted synagogue.
""85 years after Kristallnacht, synagogues in Germany's capital are set to burn again,"" said community chair Gideon Joffe, referring to mass looting and arson of Jewish businesses and institutions under Nazi Germany.
""The anti-Jewish violence on the streets of Berlin has thus taken on a new dimension.""
Joffe said that Jews in Berlin still felt unsafe despite increased security measures.

https://www.dw.com/en/daniel-noboa-hope-for-ecuador/a-67127822,POLITICS,Daniel Noboa: Hope for Ecuador? 17.10.2023,"Ecuador will soon have the youngest president in Latin America. In Sunday's run-off election, Ecuadorian voters cast their ballots for 35-year-old Daniel Noboa. He is two years younger than the Chilean president, Gabriel Boric, previously the great hope of Latin America's social-democratic left.
Daniel Noboa's father Alvaro is a business magnate and the richest man in the country. He too ran for president, five times — without success. Now his son has succeeded on his first attempt.
The president-elect previously held various positions at the Noboa Corporation, and was elected to the National Assembly in 2021. It came as a surprise when he placed second in the first round of voting. At the start of the campaign, neither the political pundits nor the pollsters thought he had much of a chance.
Noboa has little political experience, and none at all of running public institutions. He was the chosen candidate of Accion Democratica Nacional (ADN), an electoral alliance of several centre-right parties. But his alliance will only have 14 MPs in the newly elected parliament. The main opposition force will be the left-leaning Revolucion Ciudadana party, which is close to securing the 50 seats it won in the first round of voting, out of a total of 137 MPs. This is not a good basis for stable government.
Ecuador is also facing huge challenges. According to the media platform openDemocracy, in a mere two years, between 2020 and 2022, the murder rate increased by 245%, transforming the country from one of the most peaceful in the region to one of the most violent. Daniel Noboa first came to the attention of a wider public when he appeared in a televised debate wearing a bulletproof vest, after his political rival, Fernando Villavicencio, was assassinated.
But what does Noboa actually stand for? Is he really just a spoilt playboy, as he is sometimes portrayed? Or can he actually make a difference, in a country increasingly mired in violence?
""During the election campaign, Noboa himself defined his political orientation as 'centro-izquierda' [centre-left]. Nonetheless, he stands for business-friendly politics and conservative values, and can be classified as belonging to the right-wing camp,"" says Constantin Groll, head of the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung's office in Ecuador.
It is also important to note, he pointed out, that Noboa's vice-presidential candidate, Veronica Abad, espouses ""openly extreme libertarian and conservative-reactionary positions."" Groll comments: ""Noboa avoided appearing with her too often in the election campaign. All the same, she had a not insignificant role as a 'procurer' of votes from the very conservative segment of the electorate.""
However, Noboa can only hold the office of head of state and government for about 18 months, starting in mid-December. This is what remains of the term of the incumbent, conservative president, Guillermo Lasso, which is due to end in May 2025. Lasso dissolved parliament in May 2023 after two years in office: It had initiated impeachment proceedings against him on charges of embezzlement. Early elections had to be held as a result. Lasso decided not to run again, partly because of his disastrous standing in the opinion polls.
So why did voters decide in favor of another candidate from the right-wing camp, despite their disappointing experience with the incumbent? Noboa's main opponent, Luisa Gonzalez, belongs to the left-wing camp of former president Rafael Correa (in office 2007-2017). Correa was convicted of corruption, and now lives in exile in Belgium. Constantin Groll thinks voters simply didn't trust the left to provide forward-looking solutions for the country.
""Through his appearance, discourse and aesthetics, Noboa succeeded in presenting himself during the election campaign as a young and, above all, a new alternative for politics beyond the old, entrenched divisions. This was largely due to a skillful campaign on social media, and the avoidance of direct confrontation,"" says Constantin Groll.
However, Jorge Vicente Paladines, an expert in criminal law and professor at the Central University of Ecuador, comments that the very short term in office will severely limit the new president's room for maneuver. ""Eighteen months is really too short for him to keep his election promise to significantly reduce the homicide rate and minimize the fundamental problem of insecurity,"" says Paladines.
Constantin Groll from the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung in Quito shares his fear. ""Very little about the security situation will change in the short term,"" he says. Groll thinks it likely that the president will try to initiate security policy reforms through referendums. He has already announced one of these, during the election campaign.

The 20-year-old and hundreds of people were near the InterContinental London Park Lane hotel during the ""Oily Money Out"" demonstration, called by pressure groups Fossil Free London and Greenpeace, blocking all entrances to the venue.
Images showed Thunberg wearing a badge with the protest slogan and standing calmly as two police officers spoke to her. One was seen holding her arm.
Other pictures showed the activist being searched and placed in the back of a police van.
""Behind these closed doors, spineless politicians are making deals and compromises with lobbyists from [the] destructive fossil fuel industry,"" Thunberg told the media ahead of her detention.
The demonstrators accuse fossil fuel companies of intentionally slowing the global energy transition to renewables in order to make more profit.
""The world is drowning in fossil fuels. Our hopes and dreams and lives are being washed away by a flood of greenwashing and lies,"" Thunberg said. ""It has been clear for decades that the fossil fuel industries were well aware of the consequences of their business models, and yet they have done nothing.""
""We cannot let this continue. The elite of the oil and money conference. They have no intention of transition,"" she said.
""We have no other option but to put our bodies outside this conference and to physically disrupt. And we have to do that every time. We have to continue showing them that they are not going to get away with this.""

Meanwhile, environment groups have said they will continue to protest throughout the conference, which is scheduled to run until Thursday.
On Tuesday, two Greenpeace activists scaled the hotel building to unfurl a giant banner reading ""make big oil pay."" 
London's Metropolitan Police are yet to provide a statement on Thunberg. However, in a statement on social media platform X, they said that they had made 20 arrests in connection with protests outside the hotel.
This year, Thunberg has been detained by police or removed from protest rallies in Sweden, Norway and Germany.

https://www.dw.com/en/100-years-of-disney-catapulting-cartoons-to-global-fame/a-65360595,FILM,100 years of Disney: Catapulting cartoons to global fame 16.10.2023,"""Just remember, it all started with a mouse,"" Walt Disney declared in a TV program in 1954.
At that time, his film production company had already been in business for more than 30 years and was one of the most successful in the US — with cartoons!
Mickey Mouse had not only become a screen hero, but was already smiling on T-shirts, footballs and toothbrush cups. One year later, in 1955, the cartoon mouse even came to life at the first Disneyland to open in California.
Walt Disney, who was born in 1901 and grew up on a farm in Missouri, started out as a commercial artist and then discovered animated films. With just $40 in his pocket, he set off for Hollywood and, on October 16, 1923, founded the Walt Disney Company, today a billion-dollar enterprise.
""It's kind of fun to do the impossible,"" was one of the cartoon pioneer's convictions.
Hidden behind this carefree statement was an intense, almost manic work ethic and workload, but also an unwavering belief in his own ideas. Time and again, the farm boy was on the verge of bankruptcy. His projects were considered too daring; with the latest film technology always being tested and and perfected. Driven, Walt Disney was soon sleeping on a couch in his studios, hardly seeing his own children, yet working hard in order to enchant other, unfamiliar children with his on-screen fairy tales.
Walt Disney made film history in 1937: ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was the first full-length animated film to hit theaters — Mickey Mouse and Co. had previously only starred in short films. At the time, no one could have guessed that an additional 60 feature-length films would follow to this day.
After all, the daring producer Walt Disney had made a dramatic miscalculation: Instead of $250,000 (approx. €228,000), $1.5 million were required to complete the film; instead of 18 months, his cartoonists worked for three years on an idea that was considered complete lunacy in Hollywood. A feature-length animated film? Who's going to line up at the box office for that?
As became apparent after the film's release, it turned out that quite a few people would: ""Snow White"" grossed around $8 million — at a time when a movie ticket cost an average of 25 US cents.
Translated into 10 languages, the film went on to be a box office smash in 46 more countries.
Disney received an honorary Oscar at the following year's Academy Awards — or more precisely, and true to the film's title, eight: one normal-sized, plus seven miniature Oscar statuettes.
Working at Walt Disney Studios, on the other hand, was allegedly not always a fairy tale.
Requirements to work overtime, poor wages and a boss who micro-managed every stroke of the pen: those were the working conditions at the company, along with a boss whose creative ego demanded one name be shown in the opening credits — that of he himself, Walt Disney.
Even today, his signature adorns the logo of the billion-dollar corporation.
Yet it wasn't Walt Disney's talent alone that led to the success of the company.  He founded the studios together with his brother Roy, who later took over the finances.
The mouse that started it all was designed by art director Ub Iwerks, but apparently according to the strict specifications of the character's inventor.

Incidentally, Mickey Mouse was also created during an entrepreneurial low point: during a train journey back to Los Angeles. In New York, Walt Disney had been unable to reach an agreement with a distributor, who snatched his then successful short cartoons, ""Oswald the Lucky Rabbit,"" from right under his nose.
Walt Disney was both a visionary and a businessman. And he had a knack for discovering talented people.
Oddly, it was during the Great Depression at the end of the 1920s, when companies went bankrupt and many families became desperately poor, that merchandising was born.
With the ingenious advertising manager Kay Kamen on board, Mickey Mouse's likeness was emblazoned on socks, cereal boxes and footballs from the 1930s onward. Disney Studios soon earned considerably more from their advertising products than from the films themselves.
They are still a central source of income for the company, worth billions of dollars today.

Following ""Snow White,"" ""Pinocchio"" (1940), ""Dumbo"" (1941) and ""Bambi"" (1942) were among the films Disney Studios released. But the films were unable to match the success of ""Snow White"": The anticipated revenues failed to materialize, partly because the European sales market collapsed due to the Second World War.
Since hardly any banks could be found to provide the necessary loans for new productions, the company went public.
Today, according to the Institute for Media and Communications Policy, the Walt Disney Company ranks sixth among the world's most successful media groups and is part of the Dow Jones stock index, which lists the 30 most successful US companies.
During World War II, Disney Studios became an instrument of US propaganda. The studios produced numerous short films and cartoons that glorified US warfare and reproduced stereotypical images of the enemy.
For example, in the well-known propaganda film ""Der Fuehrer's Face"" (1943), Donald Duck is forced to work in an armaments factory in Nazi Germany and goes crazy hearing shouts of ""Heil Hitler.""
Likewise, Disney produced educational and training films for the US Army. Critics complained that the company would have been better off spreading pacifist and humanist messages instead of war propaganda.
In the post-World War II years, Disney built on the success of his feature-length films — with ""Alice in Wonderland"" (1951) and ""Peter Pan"" (1953).
In 1955, Walt Disney had another crazy idea: his fairy tale worlds were to become reality, and so the first Disneyland was built in the US state of California. Later, offshoots followed in Florida, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Walt Disney was awarded 26 Oscars during his lifetime — an unprecedented record. However, he did not live to see the premiere of his last film, ""The Jungle Book"" (1967), as he died of lung cancer in 1966.
Still, the Disney brand lived on, despite a massive financial crisis during the early 1980s. In 1986, Walt's nephew Roy E. Disney took over management of the animation studio and, together with Jeffrey Katzenberg, led a ""Disney renaissance"": ""The Little Mermaid"" (1989), ""Beauty and the Beast"" (1991) and ""The Lion King"" (1994) were born.
""I think when you relate Disney to anything, you relate it to magic, and imagination and creativity, and I think that's what's so different about our company: It's that we tell stories and we make magic in everything that we do,"" Betty Cline, director of the Walt Disney Archive, told DW.
From the 2000s onward, the former cartoon company set its sights on expansion. First, it bought the successful animation studio Pixar (with whom it had already produced films such as ""Toy Story"" and ""Finding Nemo""), then swallowed the numerous superhero films with Marvel, and finally, the long-running box office hit company Lucasfilm with the ""Star Wars"" series. TV series and several prequels, sequels and spin-offs followed.
Of course, in the spirit of its founder, Disney continues to keep pace with technological innovations. Although its own streaming platform Disney+ started somewhat late in 2019 and stumbled at first, its quarterly figures for 2022 now position it in third place worldwide behind Netflix and Amazon Prime.
While the billion-dollar corporation may be able to safely overcome financial hurdles, its former core business — fairy-tale films — has come under fire. Following allegations of racist depictions in classics such as ""Dumbo"" or ""The Jungle Book,"" Disney began adding warning labels to its films.
In response to criticism of cultural appropriation, such as in the marketing of the Swahili saying ""Hakuna Matata"" (loosely: ""No worries"") from the 1994 film ""The Lion King,"" the corporation is also now trying to deal more sensitively with the cultural attributes of other nations and peoples. So on the occasion of the 100th anniversary, it launched the long-awaited live-action film version of ""The Little Mermaid"" — with leading Black actress Halle Bailey.
The ""Disney 100"" international exhibition tour is currently on show in London, and opens in Chicago on November 18.

https://www.dw.com/en/poland-election-what-do-businesses-supporting-the-countrys-pink-economy-expect/a-67010429,POLITICS,Poland election: What do businesses supporting the country's pink economy expect? 14.10.2023,"Poland's capital, Warsaw, has become a center for multinational companies and global investment banks to set up offices, as the country aims to become Central Europe's financial hub.
But, a few streets away from the bustle of Warsaw's business district, in the basement of a residential building, Sebastian Wareluk's sewing machine whirs constantly.
Wareluk and his partner, Wojciech Ostrowski, are the owners of backpack company Dwa Borsuki. While they make a range of bags for big companies like haircare brand Garnier, their business also has a sizeable clientele from Poland's LGBTQ community. 
""We started this business about four and a half years ago with an aim to make colorful backpacks. We're also a gay couple and don't want to hide our identity, so we started focusing on making rainbow bags and backpacks that cater to customers from the LGBTQ+ community or anyone who supports the community in Poland,"" Ostrowski told DW.
The rights of people from the LGBTQ community in Poland have been threatened in recent years by the anti-LGBTQ narrative of the country's ruling Law and Justice party (PiS).
Two years ago, several communities in the country declared themselves to be ""LGBTQ ideology free zones."" However, some places have rescinded this status after the EU condemned such discrimination.
Despite these challenges, businesses like Dwa Boruski haven't shied away from catering to the community or realizing the potential of Poland's ""pink money,"" a term for the purchasing power of the LGBTQ community.
Ian Johnson, chief executive of Out Now, a global marketing firm that specializes in LGBTQ research and marketing, told DW that among the 10 largest EU economies, Poland's ""pink economy"" is ranked seventh and accounts for almost 165 billion zloty (€36 billion; $38.2 billion) a year.
""Given that 'pink money' represents the combined incomes earned by Poland's almost two million LGBTQ adults — and that these consumers are responsible for earnings of almost €36 billion each year — it's logical that businesses would be interested in building an advantageous position to attract more of this income,"" Johnson added.
From big multinational companies like ice cream brand Ben & Jerry's, which made a rainbow hologram to support LGBTQ rights, to Wareluk and Ostrowkski's small business, the potential of Poland's ""pink money"" has been an incentive to continue catering to the community, despite politics.
But Ostrowkski says that their business is also about attracting clientele who support the LGBTQ community. Dwa Borsuki customers even get a rebate if they show they've made a donation to an LGBTQ organization.

An hour and a half away from Warsaw, in the former textile manufacturing city of Lodz, Waclaw Miklaszewski, the co-founder of Kubota, a Polish flip-flop brand that also supports the LGBTQ community, shares a similar view.
""We don't wait for the government to understand these things because society understands things much faster. It was just normal for us to support the LGBTQ community in Poland,"" Miklaszewski told DW.
Kubota's colorful flip-flops have been famous in Poland since the mid-1990s. Now they have a turnover of over €6 million per year and listed on the Polish stock exchange last year.
Miklaszewski says that as a public company, supporting the LGBTQ community is not only about sporting the rainbow logo. ""It's also about practicing support in every product that is a part of our rainbow collection,"" he said. ""We do so by giving quite a big amount of income generated from these products to the NGOs that support the LGBTQ movement.""
While businesses like Kubota and Dwa Borsuki remain outspoken about supporting the LGBTQ community, not everyone in Poland has come to terms with it. 
""My mother stopped talking to me when she heard about who our business caters to. She supports the Law and Justice party and their ideologies,"" Ostrowski said, adding that in small towns and villages, such feelings are common.
A young Polish woman on the streets of Warsaw told DW that while the current government or any new government has to make choices based on politics and economics, people can still make a difference.
""We have a choice as people to support the LGBTQ community and their business and help our economy grow. I personally like simple colors and not rainbow colors so won't buy rainbow products. But I have no issue supporting the businesses,"" she said.
Poland heads to the polls on October 15. Migration, women's and LGBTQ rights, and the war in Ukraine are among the major campaign topics.
While the pink economy contributes about 5% of Poland's nearly €700 billion in annual GDP, Ostrowski thinks that as long as a business brings in money governments are happy.
Meanwhile, Piotr Arak, director of the Polish Economic Institute, told DW that it is wiser for politics to simply stay out of the economy. To make a country thrive they should just create regulations that enable individuals and businesses to grow.
But Out Now's Johnson argues that Polish politicians should care about the pink economy, because LGBTQ voters comprise almost 2 million votes in total, a figure that can be important in a tight contest.
""We anticipate that political candidates choosing to demonstrate support for equal treatment of LGBTQ people should expect to find the 2023 electoral landscape much more favorable than during the 2019 national parliamentary election, when support for LGBTQ people across Polish society was far less widespread,"" Johnson said.
Meanwhile, for flip-flop maker Kubota, the results of the upcoming election aren't going to stop their LGBTQ support.
""Elections or no elections, as a business we're here to support the LGBTQ community. There is no place for confrontation. If any politician is against it, we'll just send them our flip-flops and some flowers,"" Miklaszewski said.

https://www.dw.com/en/jewish-communities-in-germany-we-are-afraid/a-67094833,SOCIETY,Jewish communities in Germany: 'We are afraid' 14.10.2023,"Esther K., a real estate agent based in Berlin, who prefers not to share her real name, says she will never forget the moment she got a text message from a friend on Saturday morning reading: ""Look what's going on in Israel.""
K's first thought was: ""We're all used to something happening in this crazy little country."" But then she read the news that the Islamist militant group Hamas had unexpectedly attacked Israel from Gaza and armed fighters were advancing into the country by land, sea and air, killing people and taking hostages. Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by the US, EU and others.
Her cellphone was suddenly flooded with photos from Israel and calls for help from people asking for assistance in finding relatives who had disappeared. 
Esther K. says she has felt nothing but a black void since.
""The bodies of parents who were shot dead, next to the dead bodies of their children, video games on the Playstations still running ... those are images I can't forget,"" K. says.
Like many others, she said she stared at her phone and thought, ""what is this? What is this? Where is the military?"" 
Along with having one of the strongest armies in the world, Israel is secured by the Mossad intelligence service and Iron Dome missile defense system.
Leo Latasch, a board member and head of security for Frankfurt's Jewish community organization, is one of the many people stunned as to why the terrorist attack was not discovered in time. 
From afar, the medic watched helplessly as Israelis tried to save lives without any military protection.
""I don't know how this will end. We don't know how many more people will die,"" Latasch says in reference to Israel's possible ground offensive in Gaza. 

It is seen as especially significant that more than 100,000 Jews reside in Germany today, and that Jewish life — with its festivals, customs, schools and sports clubs — is possible just decades after 6 million Jews were killed at the hands of German Nazis during the Holocaust.
Still many Jewish institutions have reinforced secuirty, with police guards and protective fences. 
""There has been an increased security level for our facilities for quite some time,"" the spokesman for Berlin's Jewish community organization Ilan Kiesling told DW in an email.
""Since the 1970s, for example, our community members have become accustomed to community life taking place behind protective fences and monitored by surveillance cameras. Due in no small part to the alarming rise in attacks on Jewish institutions and individuals across Europe, we continue to be compelled to provide a high level of protection for our members and facilities."" 
For a long time now, large portions of Jewish community organizations' budgets have been devoted to security. Most have their own security departments, working closely with police and state criminal investigation departments. 
But now, after the attacks on Israel by Hamas, which Germany, the US and other countries consider a terrorist organization, many Jews have lost faith in those security measures. 
""The parents are scared, just scared,"" a staff member at a Jewish daycare center in Berlin told DW. In many Jewish kindergartens, children stayed home this week. 
Leo Latasch has been in charge of security for the Jewish community in Frankfurt for 37 years.
He said he has been trying to reassure parents, explaining again and again that the conflict is taking place in Israel, not Frankfurt. He says he is advising them not to panic at every — possibly fake — news report.
But he is finding it harder and harder to reassure them. ""We've never been in a situation like this before,"" Latasch says.  
The Islamist terrorist group Hamas has been seeking to mobilize the Arab and Muslim world for protests. Latasch says he doesn't blame Jewish parents if they prefer to keep their children close to them during this time. 
Antisemitism, however, is by no means only an Arab-Muslim problem in Germany. In 2022, the American Jewish Committee (AJC) commissioned a representative study by the Allensbach Institute for Demography looking into attitudes of the population as a whole. The survey showed that antisemitism is not exclusively a problem of the political fringes, but ""deeply rooted"" in the middle of society.
This is a very real threat to all Jews in Germany, says founding executive director of the OFEKcounseling center and head of the Competence Center for Antisemitism, Marina Chernivsky.
She says Jews in Germany are currently facing a twofold burden. On the one hand, there is the deep-rooted antisemitism in Germany, which is a very real threat, she said. In addition, she added, ""they are experiencing the most massive violence against the civilian population in Israel since the Shoah. This is re-triggering a deep-seated trauma. And they now have to deal with that too."" 
Since the attacks, the OFEK counseling center in Germany has been very busy. There has been a sharp increase in the number of people calling its crisis hotline for advice. Some include parents trying to understand how to talk to their children about war. 

When Russia attacked Ukraine, Esther K. was one of the helpers organizing clothing and housing for the Ukrainian refugees. Now, she has been trying to quickly find accommodation for Israelis stranded in Germany since the suspension of air traffic with Israel. Many are women with children. 
However, only one elderly lady responded to K's request for help.
""For the Germans, this is just one more disaster in the world,"" she says. She said she feels disappointed and completely alone in Germany.
When members of Samidoun — a front for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) group, widely considered a terrorist organization — distributed sweets in Berlin-Neukölln in apparent celebration of the Hamas terrorist attacks, Berlin's Jewish community in Berlin demanded the group be banned. 
""We don't want to see such images in Berlin anymore,"" Ilan Kiesling stressed. 
On Thursday, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced bans on Hamas-affiliated activities in Germany and a ban on the Samidoun association.

https://www.dw.com/en/can-indias-ancient-stepwells-solve-its-water-crisis/a-67091265,CULTURE,Can India's ancient stepwells solve its water crisis? 13.10.2023,"Stepwells, subterranean structures built into the ground to store water, were once the focal point of village life in drought-prone areas of India, providing a stable source of water for domestic use and irrigation. 
The ancient storage pools were quickly forgotten with the advent of modern water systems, and many remain disused and decrepit.
Of the 3,000 stepwells documented by experts in India, only around 400–500 are in usable condition.
But the long-overlooked architectural wonders are making a comeback, as a growing number of conservation architects, historians and urban planners fight to restore them to their original state.
Their aim is to preserve the stepwells' architecture and history — and provide a solution to India's growing water crisis.
Stepwell restoration has ""the potential to solve a lot of water availability issues at the village level, by really going back to the basics,"" said conservation architect Ratish Nanda, CEO of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), a philanthropic foundation working to preserve heritage sites across the world.
""Essentially, what we're trying to do is demonstrate how a rainwater harvesting system could have a significant impact in a micro community.""
Some 17% of India's groundwater aquifers are overexploited, according to the country's Central Groundwater Board, meaning that water is being extracted at a greater rate than it is able to recharge.
The issue of depleting water tables is being worsened by India's increasingly erratic monsoon seasons.
As a result, many states that were already prone to drought and highly dependent on groundwater are facing acute water shortages, highlighting the importance of water conservation.
In the northern Indian state of Rajasthan, one of the world's most water-stressed regions, the state government paired with the World Bank to design a roadmap to revitalize heritage sites — including several stepwells.
Not only does their restoration help the self-sufficiency of towns in drought-prone areas, many of the sites have also drawn in tourists, boosting the local economy.
One of the most prominent examples of this is in Jodhpur, a city in Rajasthan that relies heavily on tourism. In 2017, the restoration of the Toorji Ka Jhalra, a stepwell in the center of the old city, was taken on by the owners of the Raas hotel chain whose converted mansion overlooks the stepwell that had long been abandoned.
The restoration uncovered engravings of elephants and cows and scriptures of deities, its carved steps and inverted pyramid design exemplifying the Marwari architectural style of the era, preserving a key part of the city's history.
Many stepwells, ""are unique in terms of the history or the legends associated with them,"" said heritage educator and author Vikramjit Singh Rooprai, who has written a book on stepwells. ""As long as a structure stands, there is a possibility that we hold on to the correct story.""
The Toorji Ka Jhalra is now one of the most popular tourist sites in Jodhpur and has attracted fashion boutiques, cafes and other businesses looking to capitalize on the influx of tourist money in the area. 

Tourism and the conservation of key heritage sites often go hand in hand, said Nanda, who pointed out that the money generated from tourists can go towards the upkeep of the monuments.
The stepwell that sits beside the Nizamuddin Dargah, the shrine of one of the world's most famous Sufi saints, is one example of a site that continues to have religious significance — many believe the water here to be sacred.
The AKTC undertook restoration work on the stepwell — an arduous, decade-long process that involved removing 40 feet of sludge, explained Nanda. In 2021, the Nizamuddin Basti conservation project received a UNESCO Award for Excellence.
The Nizamuddin stepwell is just one of 16 stepwells that have been restored in New Delhi.
Stepwells are just the beginning of efforts to revive water bodies for the benefit of the local community however, said Rooprai.
""The same thing has to happen for all the rivers, lakes and all the water structures that we have — starting from small ponds in towns to our entire ocean.""

https://www.dw.com/en/japan-takes-funerals-into-the-metaverse-for-convenience/a-67087091,SOCIETY,Japan takes funerals into the metaverse for convenience 13.10.2023,"Companies in Japan are looking to provide innovative new products and services to meet the demands of a market that has undergone rapid and dramatic change in the last half century.
Tradition has been replaced in many sectors by technology — and firms that are slow to embrace that evolution lose ground to their rivals.
The same rule holds true even in death care industry, where demand is rising.
There were a record 1.58 million deaths in Japan during 2022, up from 1.26 million in 2012, continuing a long-term trend as Japan's population ages and declines.
And as elsewhere, companies in the funerals and memorials business are delivering convenience for consumers.
Alpha Club Musashino specializes in event services, although its eight wedding venues and 80 funeral halls indicate the latter part of its business is becoming increasingly important.
Based in Saitama Prefecture, just north of Tokyo, the company is putting the finishing touches to a digital graveyard that can be accessed by the family of the deceased at any time.

""A lot of people do not live near their family grave site any more and are very busy, which makes it difficult for them to visit and pay their respects,"" said Kie Ishii, who heads the digital project's rollout. 
""People will be able to access our metaverse cemetery through their computer or mobile phone and see their avatar with other people,"" she told DW.
Users will be able to see photos of their deceased loved ones, deliver virtual flowers, leave messages in books of condolence and communicate with other people paying their virtual respects through a chat function on the site.
Another benefit of remembering a loved one online is that there is no need to buy a plot of land at a temple, erect a gravestone and then pay for its upkeep.
""My grandfather died three years ago and my father now takes care of the family grave, but it's in a little village in the mountains of northern Gifu Prefecture and it takes me more than three hours to drive there,"" said Yae Oono, a housewife who now lives in Kawasaki, south of Tokyo.
""I do want to pay my respects and we always go during the Obon season to clean the grave and leave new flowers,"" she added, referring to the festival period when many Japanese take their summer vacation.
She is not, however, completely sold on the idea of falling back on technology to pay her respects instead of being there in person.
""It would be more convenient and quicker to do everything online, but that's not really the point,"" she said.
""It is where my grandparents' ashes are kept and where their family came from originally so I do think it is important to make an effort and keep a connection with that part of my family history. But I am not sure if my children will feel the same in the future.""
Change is undoubtedly afoot in the grounds of Japan's temples, with a survey this year by Tokyo-based communications firm Planet Inc showing that 36% of Japanese no longer visit their family graves, the Yomiuri newspaper reported, with the majority saying they simply do not have time to go in person because they live so far away.
There were nearly 119,000 applications to relocate a family grave to a new site in 2021 — up 55% from 10 years previously, a government study indicated.
In the city of Takamatsu, in Shikoku, there are cemeteries where 40% of the graves have been abandoned, the Asahi daily said in an editorial, with local authorities at a loss as to how to deal with the forgotten tombstones and cremated ashes in funeral urns.
But companies are not being put off by reservations linked to a sense that the old traditions need to be preserved and protected.

Smart Senior, a telecommunications company, has developed a system whereby a gravestone has a QR code embedded in it that when accessed provides access to video clips or still images of the deceased and the family.
Tokyo's Shinkyoji Temple can trace its history back to the 1460s but has leaped into the modern day with the construction of robotic columbaria, niches inside a wall that hold funeral urns.
Mourners use an electronic key card that delivers images of their loved ones on a screen while the automated system collects the urn from its resting place and delivers it to the altar where visitors can pay their respects.
It appears likely that future generations of Japanese will have little need for physical graveyards and will be recalling their ancestors on their mobile phones and the metaverse.

https://www.dw.com/en/poles-in-germany-record-number-to-vote-in-polish-election/a-67087770,POLITICS,Poles in Germany: Record number to vote in Polish election 13.10.2023,"""Of course we're going to vote. This might well be the most important election ever,"" says Elzbieta, who is shopping at the outdoor market in Berlin-Charlottenburg. Although she's lived in Germany for 40 years, she's still very interested in what goes on in her native Poland.
""I have friends and family in Poland,"" she says, ""I want things to be good for them. And I just don't like what's going on there right now."" Elzbieta feels that the ruling national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, which has been in power for eight years, is ""driving the country into the ground.""
Grazyna, who runs a mobile Polish delicatessen, nods in agreement: ""Of course I'm going to vote,"" she says. ""The country has to be saved.""
She too has lived in Berlin for a long time but still wants to have a say in Poland's future and has been following the election campaign closely.
Like many Polish expats, however, the two women are worried their votes in the parliamentary election on October 15 will not count.
According to Poland's electoral rules, all votes cast must be counted within 24 hours of the polls closing, otherwise all votes cast in that polling station will be deemed null and void.
An electoral reform adopted in early 2023 introduced a new method of counting that slows down the process: every member of the district electoral commission must view each ballot during the count. Although the idea was to increase transparency, this change will also hold up proceedings.
And that could prove a problem, especially for those electoral commissions with a very large number of votes to count. The situation will also be exacerbated by the referendum taking place on the same day. Votes cast in the referendum also have to be counted within 24 hours.
Ludwik Wasiak, chairman of a district electoral commission in Berlin, told DW that the electoral reform relating to the vote count could turn out to be an ""own goal.""
""We're worried about certain aspects,"" he said. ""Time is sure to be tight, but we'll work hard to ensure everything is done by the book.""
Wasiak is also chairman of the National Party (Stronnictwo Narodowe). On the last Sunday before the election, he was outside Berlin's Basilica of St. John the Baptist, seat of the Polish Catholic mission, handing out flyers and brochures for the candidates of the United Right alliance and the ultra-right Confederation party.
""Everyone seems to know that this is a very important election, perhaps one of the most important in our recent history.""
He encouraged people to vote in the referendum too, but admitted that many were reluctant.
Pensioner and PiS supporter Janina intends to go straight from mass to the polling station on Sunday. When talking to DW, she made no secret of her dislike for Donald Tusk, leader of the opposition Civic Platform (PO).
""If he wins, Poland will be sold off. We've got to save the country,"" she says. She intends to vote in both the election and the referendum, where she says she is ""going to vote 'no' four times.""
Among other things, voters will be asked: ""Do you support the admission of thousands of illegal immigrants from the Middle East and Africa, in accordance with the forced relocation mechanism imposed by European bureaucracy?""
The other three questions are about the sale of national assets to foreign entities, raising the retirement age, and the removal of barriers on the Polish–Belarusian border.
Voters who back the opposition are likely to boycott the referendum. Monika, a 53-year-old kindergarten teacher in Berlin, left Poland in 1992 but still has a close bond with the country.
She intends to vote in the parliamentary election, but won't be accepting ballot papers for the referendum in an attempt to reduce turnout. She considers the questions ""tendentious.""
""As someone who lives in Germany, it really angers me that Germany is being spat on in the Polish election campaign,"" she says. She feels that Germany should recognize Poland's right to war reparations, even if ""it would have to be paid out of our taxes.""
Nevertheless, she is appalled by the way the Polish government is asserting its claim and exerting pressure. ""More diplomacy is needed, not spitting,"" she says.
Poles living abroad had to register to vote in the election and referendum by October 10. Almost 109,000 Polish expats — a record number — registered in Germany alone. The 47 district electoral commissions across Germany expect long lines outside polling stations on Sunday.
In 2019, about 46,000 people cast their votes in 23 district electoral commissions.
Maciej Kowalski, coordinator of the Polish citizens' election-monitoring initiative in Germany is delighted that the Polish community is so keen, but points out that this is just a small proportion of Poles living in Germany.
Various sources estimate that 1.5–2 million Poles live in Germany. According to the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, there are about 881,000 Polish citizens in the country. It is estimated that there are over two million people ""with a Polish migration background"" in Germany, many of whom hold dual citizenship.
""When you compare these numbers with the number of registered voters, there is still huge potential for political activity,"" says Kowalski.
At present, votes cast by Polish voters abroad are counted as being cast in Warsaw. Kowalski feels that a separate constituency for expats with its own lawmakers and senators — as in France — could increase turnout among overseas voters.
""The Polish diaspora has its own interests in Poland. Many are considering moving back; what happens in Poland matters to them; they have businesses and property there.""
Kasia works in a Polish supermarket in Essen. She hasn't yet decided who she'll vote for on Sunday, but is worried that Poland could leave the EU if PiS is reelected. ""That would be it, then,"" she says. ""But it's also about women's right to choose,"" she adds, referring to Poland's restrictive abortion laws.
For 21-year-old Dominika, the situation for women in Poland is the main issue. The country's abortion law prohibits pregnancy termination even if there are medical indications of irreversible damage to the fetus or an incurable disease that poses a threat to the life of the child. This is why Dominika, who has lived in Germany for five years, will be voting.
""This will be a very important election,"" she said. ""It's about the future of our family in Poland and how they're going to live.""
Agnieszka Lada-Konefal of the German Poland Institute in Darmstadt says that Poles in Germany are interested in different issues than voters in Poland, where inflation and the health system are at the top of the agenda.
""For Poles abroad, the rule of law and membership of the European Union are key,"" she told DW, adding that issues surrounding Poland's relations with the EU may motivate Poles living abroad to vote.
In the last parliamentary election in 2019, Polish expats — including those in Germany — voted very differently to their compatriots back home.
In Poland, the ruling PiS got 43.6% of votes and the opposition PO 27.4%. Overseas, it was a very different story: PO was ahead with 38.95% of the vote, with PiS trailing on 24.85%.

https://www.dw.com/en/hawaiis-ironman-goes-ironwoman/a-67075961,SPORTS,Hawaii's Ironman goes Ironwoman 13.10.2023,"You could argue that it would be more fitting to refer to the 2023 triathlon in the small municipality of Kailua-Kona on the island of Hawaii as the ""Ironwoman."" For the first time since the Ironman made its debut in 1978, only women will be competing in the race that features a 3.8-kilometer (2.4 miles) swim, a 180-kilometer bike ride and a marathon.
""The energy and the vibe around town is going to be different – I'm looking forward to it,"" said Britain's Laura Siddall ahead of what will be her fifth Ironman in the Pacific US state.
It's an ""opportunity to get more women here, there are so many first timers, so (it's) really bolstering the female side of the sport,"" Siddall added.
However, four-time winner of the Hawaii Ironman, Daniela Ryf, who is again among the favorites, doesn't seem quite as enthusiastic about the new format.
""I'm going to miss the guys a little bit. It will change the race dynamic. And the vibe before the start,"" said the Swiss athlete, who set a new world record at the Ironman in Roth, Germany, in June.
""Now we women have the stage completely to ourselves.""
However, this isn't the first time the men and the women have been separated – last year they competed on two different days. While this did have the desired effect of putting the women in greater focus than previously, it didn't solve the problem of what had become an unmanageable number of visitors to the island. The number of participants had grown to around 5,500, more than double that of the previous edition prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. That's not to mention the athletes' partners and supporters.
It proved to be simply too much for Kailua-Kona and its 23,000 inhabitants.
""The infrastructure isn't designed for that,"" said DW reporter Tobias Oelmaier, who was in Kailua-Kona as a triathlete himself at last year's Ironman. ""At times, the local grocery store ran out of pasta and bottled water,""
This was not to the liking of the athletes ― or the locals.
""They were angry because they had to close their businesses for longer than usual, angry because they couldn't get to work because athletes were everywhere and acting like they owned the place,"" said Canadian former triathlete Sara Gross of last year's event.
""We learned… that more than one race day during IRONMAN week is too many for the community to manage,"" concluded Hawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth.
Organizers came to the same conclusion, which led to the decision to separate the men's and women's races not only in time, as in 2022, but also in space. Now the plan is for the men and women to alternate between Hawaii and Nice on the French Riviera until at least 2026. This year's men's Ironman World Championship was held in Nice on September 10.
The change is not without its critics, among them, two-time Hawaii winner Patrick Lange. The German, who took silver at the premiere in Nice, insists that ""this race belongs in Hawaii.""
""I have adjusted to the challenge of Nice by necessity,"" he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper.
More than 2,100 triathletes from 73 nations will compete in Hawaii this Saturday ― 53 of them in the professional category. Among the contenders on the professional side is Germany's Anne Haug, who won the women's event in 2019, and finished third in 2018 and 2022.
""The island likes me. I always win a medal,"" the 40-year-old said in the run-up with a wink. 
Like Ryf, it seems German contender Laura Philip will miss the men a bit.
""It feels weird, I have to be honest,"" the 36-year-old Philipp said. ""But also in a good way. I'm sure it will be really cool.
""I heard from Nice that there was an excess of testosterone without the women. I can't say yet whether I feel like there's a surplus of estrogen here,"" added the 2021 and 2022 European champion.
Her preference, she said, would be for the event to be held in the future at a location in which women and men could compete together again – just on different days.
Incidentally, equal pay has never been an issue at the Ironman in Hawaii. Starting in 1986, when prize money was first awarded, the men and women have always received the same amount. This year, the winner in Hawaii will receive $125,000 (€118,000) – exactly the same amount as Frenchman Sam Laidlow, who finished first in Nice.

A special court responsible for corruption and organized crime granted a request by public prosecutors to have the 79-year-old confined to his apartment in the capital Tirana until further notice, the ATA news agency reported.
""No criminal charge or new evidence supported this new request,"" Berisha's lawyers  Genk Gjokutaj and Sokol Mengjesi said. ""None of the legal criteria required for imposing or escalating such restrictions are met in this case.""
Berisha's legal team plans to appeal the decision, which also bans any foreign travel.
Albanian media outlets reported that several police officers arrived at Berisha's apartment building in downtown Tirana on Saturday.
Berisha has been accused by prosecutors of abusing the power of his office during his first term as prime minister, between 2005 and 2009.

The case involves the privatization of a sports center in Tirana, from which his son-in-law is said to have profited.
The public land was used to build 17 apartment buildings. 
Berisha denies the allegations and has accused current Prime Minister Edi Rama of carrying out political repression to silence the opposition.
Albania's parliament lifted his immunity earlier this month, paving the way for the criminal investigation to proceed.
Lawmakers loyal to Berisha tried to disrupt the session and boycotted the vote.
Two years ago, Berisha was added to US and UK sanctions lists due to suspected corruption and links to organized crime.
He is barred from entering both countries.
Berisha was elected as Albania's first freely elected president in 1992 after the collapse of communist rule. He served as head of state until 1997.
He was prime minister from 2005 to 2013.
Until 2013, Berisha also led the Democratic Party of Albania (PD), currently the country's largest opposition party, a post which he returned to last year.

https://www.dw.com/en/turkish-super-cup-final-postponed-over-t-shirt-row/a-67857079,SPORTS,Turkish Super Cup final postponed over t-shirt row 30.12.2023,"The Turkish Super Cup final in Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh, on Friday was postponed because of a disagreement between organizers and the Galatasaray and Fenerbahce football clubs.
According to Turkish media reports players from the clubs wanted to wear shirts featuring the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, during their warm-up.
Friday's match between Turkey's league champions and cup winners would have coincided with the centennial anniversary of the proclamation of the Turkish Republic by Ataturk.
They also wanted to use banners bearing Ataturk's words ""Peace at home, peace in the world"" during the game but were reportedly denied permission by the Saudi organizers.
The Turkish Football Federation and the clubs blamed the postponement on ""some problems"" with the event's organization.
Saudi Arabia has recently moved to stage international games and tournaments ahead of the men's World Cup it is all but certain to host in 2034.
""We were looking forward to holding the match on time in accordance with the international soccer rules and regulations that require the sport to be presented without any slogans outside its scope, especially since this was discussed with the Turkish (Football) Federation in the framework of the preparatory meetings for the match,"" organizers said in a statement cited by Saudi media. 

""Despite this agreement, it was unfortunate that the two teams did not adhere to what had been agreed upon, which led to the match not being held.""
It was unclear where or when the final would be staged, but Turkish football supporters urged the clubs to play the match on home soil.

https://www.dw.com/en/top-subsidiaries-of-property-giant-signa-file-for-bankruptcy/a-67842317,BUSINESS,Top subsidiaries of property giant Signa file for bankruptcy 28.12.2023,"Signa Prime Selection AG, a key subsidiary of the now insolvent Austrian Signa Holding that owns prestigious real estate in Germany, filed for bankruptcy on Thursday.
The company announced that it had filed for debtor-in-possession reorganization proceedings with the Vienna Commercial Court. It said the Signa Development Selection AG would follow suit on Friday.
""The aim is the organized continuation of business operations within the framework of self-administration and the sustainable restructuring of the company,"" the company said in a press release.
The online sporting goods division Signa Sports United had already filed for insolvency in October, while Signa Holding itself and several smaller subsidiaries announced their insolvency in recent weeks.

Signa Prime Selection owns the luxury KaDeWe department store in the German capital, Berlin, the Elbtower in Hamburg, and properties of the Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof department store chain, among other things.
It builds and lets properties, leaving the retail operations of the department stores to other businesses.
According to the company website, it owns properties worth a total of €20.4 billion ($22.7 billion). Its annual report for 2022 listed liabilities of almost €10.8 billion at the end of the previous year.
Signa Development focuses on residential and commercial urban development projects. The current balance sheet total is stated on its website as €4.6 billion.
Signa Holding, a network of some 1,000 companies, is owned by Austrian real estate and retail mogul Rene Benko.
The network has recently been beset by the higher building costs, energy prices, and interest rates that have dogged the entire property sector of late, while the brick-and-mortar retail sector is also struggling, partly against online competition.
The holding firm filed for insolvency in November this year.

https://www.dw.com/en/tourettes-syndrome-no-barrier-to-golfing-passion/a-67804089,SPORTS,Tourette's syndrome no barrier to golfing passion 28.12.2023,"Robin Smiciklas is about to tee off. With his spikes dug into the fairway, he takes aim at the green. A brief moment of calm to collect himself. Then his left arm twitches. Once. Twice. Then even more violently a third time. Smiciklas just lets it happen. His concentration seems unbroken. Moments later, he sends the ball on its way down the fairway with a textbook drive.
""It's often the case that a few more tics just have to come out,"" he tells DW. ""It took me a few years to get to the point where neither that nor what others may be thinking about me can break my concentration,"" says Smiciklas, who suffers from Tourette's syndrome.
The syndrome has caused his muscles to twitch abruptly since he was eight years old. Despite this impairment, he turned pro a year ago.
""I'm happy with the season I've had and have shown that I can play at the front of the pack,"" he says.
His goal? To make it to the upper echelons of the golfing world in the next two to three years.
At 31, Smiciklas is a late bloomer. Tourette's held him back for a long time, his doubts were simply too great.
""It's only now that I'm in a mental state that allows me to say that this is no longer a reason for me not to give it a try.""
With sponsors who are ""going along with this crazy story,"" he is now pursuing his dream. By turning pro he also made a conscious decision to make his Tourette's syndrome public.
""Self-protection was one motive,"" Smiciklas says.
He has been used to getting funny looks since childhood. Now he figures that there are bound to be fewer of these if his competitors and the public know about it. At the same time, he wants to help destigmatize the ailment.
""Through the media, people tend only to know the extreme form of the syndrome, with swear words and blatant obsessive-compulsive disorders,"" he says.
On the other hand, there is much less awareness of the non-verbal variant that he is afflicted with.
""I want to change that.""
You may think that somebody with Tourette's trying to make it as a professional golfer is a crazy idea. Not so, says Professor Markus Raab, head of the Performance Psychology Department at the German Sport University in Cologne. One factor that works in favor of golf, he says, is that it is a ""discrete sport"" in which the athlete is free to decide when he or she strikes the ball. This stands in stark contrast to a sport like tennis, in which the athlete is forced to react to a ball played by the opponent.
""With Tourette's, it's not possible to suppress everything 100%,"" Professor Raab tells DW, ""but those affected have the option of temporarily influencing their tics.""
Smiciklas confirms this from his own experience. After many a successful round, the tics return with a vengeance and leave him barely able to rest in the hours that follow. Nevertheless, sport has always provided him with balance and reassurance.
""In this respect, the studies are quite clear,"" Raab explains. ""If you don't overdo it, exercise has positive effects on our motor skills, our perception, but also on our emotions."" This applies equally to people with Tourette's and other psychological and neurological impairments.
In fact, there are athletes with Tourette's syndrome who have made it into the world elite. Tim Howard, the starting goalkeeper for more than a decade at Manchester United and Everton in the Premier League and the US men's national soccer team, is one such case.
Another example is Mahmoud Abdul Rauf, who went up against the legendary Michael Jordan in a nine-year NBA career. His variant of Tourette's is the one that doesn't just cause muscles to twitch, but also results in uncontrollable swearing – known as vocal tics.
He also suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder during his years as a player. Only when he felt his shoes were tied perfectly could he take to the court. To finish his shooting training, it was not the number of hits that was decisive for him but hearing precisely the ""right"" sound of the ball hitting the floor. All that practicing made the now 54-year-old one of the best long-range shooters in the game. 
When asked about the ""advantages"" that Tourette's has brought him in his sport, Smiciklas doesn't have to think twice.
""In difficult situations on the golf course, I posess a certain creativity about how I can still get the ball to where I want it to go,"" he explains.
This is a skill he developed during his difficult years as a teenager, when he was always looking for ways to conceal his tics to make it seem like he was like everyone else.
Although Tourette's is so closely interwoven with his personality, it's clear that it's not something that Smiciklas likes to dwell on. His performance on the links and promotion to the Challenge Tour are what he's focused on.
If it works out, Smiciklas will have proven his idol, the late NBA legend Kobe Bryant, right, when he said: ""You just can't underestimate the power of showing up every single day and doing the work.""

https://www.dw.com/en/sports-psychology-in-german-football-making-progress/a-67831510,SOCCER,Sports psychology in German football making progress 27.12.2023,"Regardless of who is winning, losing or playing, the major narratives in German football are often attributed to Kopfsache – literally translated as a ""mind matter.""
About 5% of athletes in elite sports suffer from depression, roughly in line with the general population. German football is already extremely aware of mental illnesses like depression after the tragic death of Robert Enke in 2009, so how is the current sports psychology system in Germany faring?
In September, Rene Paasch, one of Germany's most prominent sports psychologists, suggested the role was in need of a ""paradigm shift"" because ""outdated thought patterns and approaches"" had left little room for innovation. Many others in the field however, have said otherwise.
Johanna Belz, a sports psychologist at Germany's most famous sports university in Cologne, has spoken positively of her time working at Cologne's football academy, commenting on the club's comprehensive approach to sports psychology.
""My experiences were with very open academies that do a lot more than the minimum,"" Belz told DW. ""But, of course, in academies where one sport psychologist is in charge of 10 teams, that's just not possible. Some need to take a look at themselves in the mirror, but we also need to celebrate those academies that go above and beyond.""

There are others who feel the perspective expressed by Paasch does not reflect the current reality.
""Another problem for sports psychology in German football at the moment is that there is still a stereotypical, conservative image of psychological work in a high-performance context,"" Christoph Herr, the coordinator of psychology at the German soccer federation (DFB), told DW.
""That's why it's very important how we publicize our trustworthy work. It's not always about us being louder, it's about listening more closely to our experienced colleagues who are established in football.
""And I would sometimes like to see fewer sweeping statements and more collegial, ethical behaviour. Then the image of sports psychology wouldn't be so distorted.""

Another thing often forgotten is that it's only been five years since the DFB made sports psychologists compulsory at academies — and that time included a global pandemic. With that in mind, progress has been solid, with Herr saying he increasingly hears academy bosses talking about sports psychology with an extensive concept behind their words.
Naturally, some old-fashioned approaches remain, but Herr believes one of the best things sports psychology in German football can do now is to become more involved with the decision-makers in the game.
""We don't have the only correct truth, but rather want to enter into dialogue with coaches and decision-makers [through training and further education]. The involvement of sports psychologists and psychological expertise within the football system is fundamental to the healthy development of young people. Raising awareness of this should be promoted during the ongoing development of sports psychology. Some clubs are supplementing this topic with additional modern coach developers.""
The field has long evolved beyond the firefighter role it's often reduced to, but German academies are not yet ready to meet that demand, often because of cost or a lack of knowledge.
Timo Heinze is one of two academy sports psychologists at Leverkusen and has worked with some of the best young players in Germany. For Heinze, a former player himself, the change has not been rapid, but it is happening.
""Compared to many professional fields in football, we are still in the relatively early stages,"" Heinze told DW. ""However, the quantity and quality of sports psychology is growing from season to season, and I am convinced that this trend will continue in the future. The need is there and is also recognized by clubs and managers. Compared to other areas of a player's football performance such as technique, tactics or athleticism, mental skills certainly offer the greatest potential for development.
""In the end, it's about the players. It's about creating a space in which their mental health is protected in the best possible way despite the tough business of football. It's about bringing them closer to individual solutions in different areas of life in the sense of holistic personal development. And, of course, to show them ways in which they can improve their performance through mental strategies.""
Employing more sports psychologists is absolutely necessary, particularly in women's youth football given, as Johanna Belz highlighted, more psychological provision was required there. But changes to the environment are also necessary to improve psychological safety.
""Why does a person often have to deal with hundreds of problems when they could actually focus on the essential issues by improving the environment?"" Herr asked.
Another suggested improvement has been educational reforms, although Belz felt she got a lot of opportunities to learn more than just the theory through the 100 contact hours required to complete the course. She did, however, notice a deficit in her abilities at the end of the qualification and so completed a course with the goal of learning conversation techniques so as to feel more capable in the job.
But the German soccer federation appears to have recognized some of these gaps, firstly by offering a specific six-month course to sports psychologists working in football in recognition of the unique demands of the sport. And secondly, by introducing six regional hubs so that sports psychologists from different academies can meet and exchange ideas.
Sports psychology in German football has made strides in the short time it has been compulsory, but like any constantly evolving field it's greatest challenge now is to keep up. If it can, there is every reason to believe a more multidimensional, holistic approach is possible.

https://www.dw.com/en/how-is-climate-change-affecting-europes-ski-season/a-67757334,TRAVEL,How is climate change affecting Europe's ski season? 27.12.2023,"Anton Bodner was relieved when it snowed heavily in Kitzbühel, Austria, just in time for the start of the ski season.
""This has taken a lot of pressure off,"" said the CEO of Bergbahn AG Kitzbühel, which operates 57 lifts around the small Austrian ski resort town. When there's snow, the lifts transport about 1.5 million tourists each winter.
""This year, nature gifted us this good start to the season,"" said Bodner. ""One which we haven't had for a long time.""
Despite the strong start of the ski season in Kitzbühel, the consequences of climate change are clear to see in the Alps. Rising temperatures are causing glaciers to melt, and that means less snow, making ski tourism an increasingly unpredictable business. In Kitzbühel, for example, during the famous Hahnenkamm ski race in January 2023, skiers raced down the legendary challenging ski run known as the ""Streif"" on artificial snow. Brown meadows flanked the snowy strip.
""Of course we are aware of climate developments,"" said Bodner. ""It would be crazy not to be."" He assumes that the snow line, the level on a mountain above which snow is found for most of the year, will recede by about 200 meters (660 feet) by 2050. But, thanks to the possibility of making artificial snow, ""there will still be skiing in Kitzbühel in decades to come,"" he said. Bodner doesn't believe that ski tourism will vanish in the area. 
Robert Steiger, an associate professor in the public finance department at the University of Innsbruck, has been studying the effects of climate change on the industry for years. He is currently working on the basis of the most pessimistic climate scenario, according to which 80% of ski resorts in the Austrian Alps will still have enough snow in 2050 — although it won't be all natural snow. He believes there will be an increase in water use of up to 100% to account for artificial snowmaking.
""Some ski resorts will still be operational at the end of the century,"" he said. ""For others, however, it will already be difficult in 20 years.""
First and foremost, operators need to be aware of climate-related risks. The specific impact of climate change varies from case to case, and it's not possible to make blanket statements about what can be done to mitigate change.
""However, it has to be said that most destinations are primarily concerned with how they can safeguard their snow-related tourist business,"" said Steiger. 
The vast majority of companies in the industry are focusing on winter sports enthusiasts and providing enough artificial snow to keep them coming, said Werner Bätzing, a professor emeritus of cultural geography at the Friedrich-Alexander University in Erlangen-Nuremberg.
That's because winter sports enthusiasts bring in significantly more money than other vacationers, he said. Plus, as the market shrinks, competition increases. ""This has led to merciless cut-throat competition,"" said Bätzing.
Many Alpine destinations continue to rely on ski tourism, as the demand for winter breaks remains high and a lack of snowfall can still be offset through artificial snowmaking.
But there have also been calls for change. The aim of the EU-funded Beyond Snow project is to encourage a rethink in the industry. ""For many cable car companies, climate change is still a taboo subject,"" said Giovanni Vassena of Alpine Pearls, an organization that represents various regional destinations that focus on sustainable tourism.
The municipality of Werfenweng, near Salzburg, offers alpaca hikes, toboggan runs and horse-drawn carriage rides — alongside stellar ski slopes.
Other regions have accepted that they are increasingly dependent on artificial snow. Every January, Ruhpolding in the southern German state of Bavaria hosts the Biathlon World Cup. Gregor Matjan, head of the city's tourism board, said officials were well aware of the possibility that each year might bring less snowfall. Their solution is to rely on artificial snow to prepare cross-country ski trails used by tourists.
""I assume that this will continue to be the case for at least the next decade,"" said Matjan. Other regions are creating ski trails made of plastic mats, which could make cross-country skiing a year-round activity.

""We are thinking very hard about how our tourism model needs to change,"" said Bodner, of the Kitzbühel cable car company. The resort town is considering creating tourism offerings outside of the winter season, which could include mountain tours on electric bikes, among other activities.
At the moment, however, Bodner and others are simply hoping for colder temperatures and fresh snowfall.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , in particular, has often been the target of smear campaigns. One video in September allegedly showed Zelenskyy belly dancing in a skin-tight golden costume. But DW research determined the video to be a deepfake that had superimposed the president's face on a dancer's body.
In July, ""news"" circulated worldwide that Sweden had declared sex a sport and was organizing a tournament. Many international media outlets also reported on it, including the Times of India, one of the country's most respected newspapers. One report said Sweden wanted to organize a tournament in which participants would have sex with each other for up to six hours a day to see who was the best.
This claim was false, DW fact check research showed. Göteborgs-Posten, one of Sweden's major daily newspapers, had reported that Dragan Bratic, the owner of several strip clubs in the country, had applied to have sex classified as a sport. However, the Swedish Sports Confederation rejected this application in May, he confirmed to DW.
Along with dozens of photos of what appear to be used condoms, several Facebook posts earlier this year claimed that six students from Kenya had been arrested for cleaning used condoms and selling them as new.
But a reverse image search showed that the claim was false. However, according to a 2020 news report, almost 324,000 used condoms were indeed cleaned and resold — but in Vietnam, not Kenya. And not by six students, but rather by employees at a small factory.
In May 2023, various Facebook users wrote that a patient X-rayed in a Kenyan state hospital was found to have a live cockroach in his chest. But the image with the alleged evidence was photoshopped, a reverse image search showed. The original X-ray image was published on a radiology website — sans cockroach.
As more people get easy access to artificial intelligence, there have been an increasing number of videos in which AI-generated ""doctors"" give health tips. One such video, in which an AI doctor claims chia seeds can help control diabetes, recently went viral.
However, both the doctor and the claim are fake. According to studies, chia seeds can have a positive effect on health and also have anti-diabetic effects, but experts say they can neither control nor cure the illness.
At 81 years of age, US President Joe Biden has faced repeated claims that he is too old to hold office. In June 2023, an alleged photo of him kneeling on the floor with a diaper peeking out of his trousers circulated in some countries.
But a reverse image search showed that the photo was manipulated. While Biden did actually fall down at a US Air Force Academy ceremony later that month, numerous videos and photos of the incident showed no evidence of a diaper.
Back in 2022, TikToker Kass Theaz made a video in which she claimed to be suing her parents for not getting her consent to bring her into the world. In another video from June 2022, she said she had won the lawsuit. And in November 2023 she claimed her parents now have to pay her $5,000 ($4,540) in damages each month. That video now has over 3.5 million views.
Though comments under it show that many users believe her, Theaz's TikTok profile clearly states that she is running a satire account.
A viral Facebook post claimed that an airplane took off from New York in 1955, went missing, and landed again 37 years later in Miami, Florida.
But research by the fact-checking team at French news agency AFP showed that there is no evidence of this ever happening. Not only do US authorities have no data showing that an airplane took off from New York and disappeared in 1955, the story was also originally published by a US tabloid known for its fictional content.
On June 18, five people set off to view the Titanic — which sank in 1912 — in a mini-submarine operated by the company OceanGate. But shortly after it was lowered into the sea, communications with the crew ceased, triggering a massive rescue operation that captured the world's attention.
An alleged screenshot of a CNN article claiming the submersible had been found empty went viral. But DW research showed it was clearly a fake.
A closer look at the screenshot revealed that it does not mirror the news channel's current design format. The alleged cover image also showed a submersible called ""Cyclops 1"" rather than the ""Titan"" submarine that was later found destroyed, and text in the article was also incorrect.
Fake news about Disney has been popular for years. In November, a website claimed the Disney World amusement park in Orlando, Florida, had torn down Cinderella's famous castle in the course of a single night. This claim spread in a TikTok video that was viewed more than a million times.
However, both the article and video were satire — as a glance at the website's legal notice shows. And for anyone still in doubt, recent footage of the amusement park shows that the castle, the park's landmark, still stands.

https://www.dw.com/en/olympics-a-huge-challenge-for-frances-security-agencies/a-67801883,SPORTS,Olympics a 'huge challenge' for France's security agencies 22.12.2023,"A carefree stroll along the Seine on a warm summer evening or a saunter over to the Eiffel Tower will hardly be possible during the Olympic Games in Paris. New security measures simply won't allow it.
The city will be divided into districts — visitors and even residents will need QR codes to pass through police barriers. Traffic will be severely restricted and subway stations will be closed. Any resident receiving visitors in the restricted areas will probably have to have them registered.
""Some of the measures are extremely unpopular, which is why many Parisians are not at all happy that the Games are taking place in their city,"" Mathieu Zagrodzki, a lecturer on internal security at the University of Versailles, told DW.
At the same time, he described the task ahead of security agencies in the French capital as a ""huge challenge.""
Now, those security agencies are using social media to try to get residents mentally prepared for the restrictions and large-scale, artificial-intelligence-supported video surveillance that will be coming their way next summer.
However, despite the extreme security precautions, Sylvia Schenk believes it will be possible to enjoy a carefree Games. The former track-and-field athlete has attended several Summer Olympics as an official, and was an athlete at the 1972 Games in Munich when Israeli athletes were victims of a terrorist attack. Schenk does not expect anything like that to happen in Paris.
""The French security forces should be able to prevent [something like] that,"" she told DW. ""That was a targeted attack on the Israeli team at the Games, not terrorism directed against specators or others.""
However, Schenk isn't without her concerns. The conflict in the Middle East, she noted, has led to ""terrorism threat levels being raised in almost every country.""
Even without the Olympics, France has often been the target of terrorist attacks in recent years, the biggest having come in Paris in 2015 and Nice a year later. Early this December, a German tourist was killed in a suspected Islamist-motivated attack near the Eiffel Tower in which the assailant injured two more victims with a hammer. The attack provided fresh impetus to the security debate surrounding the Olympics.
The main focus will be on the spectacular opening ceremony. For the first time in history, it will not take place in a stadium. Instead, athletes will travel down the Seine by boat, across the French metropolis between the Pont d'Austerlitz and the Pont d'Iena bridges — a distance of about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) — with more than half a million spectators expected to line the banks.
""There will be 40,000 police officers and around 20,000 private security personnel on duty. Plus support from the military,"" said Zagrodzki.
French Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera has rejected calls from critics who argue that the Olympics should be postponed.
""We don't have a plan B, we have a plan A in which there are several B plans,"" she said in a recent radio interview.
One option, depending on the threat level, could be to reduce the number of spectators.
Zagrodzki sees the Olympics as an opportunity for the French security forces to spruce up their battered reputation.
""France doesn't have the most positive image when it comes to the smooth running of sporting events,"" he said.
Police misconduct surrounding the 2022 Champions League final at the Stade de France has made an impact.
""The problem is that the French police have so far viewed large groups of fans, especially in sport, not as guests to be managed and escorted, but as a threat,"" said Zagrodzki, arguing that communication between the emergency services needs to improve significantly.
""The international observers will pay close attention to how this is handled.""
Undeterred by security concerns, Schenk, a lawyer by profession, will be among them.
""I have a ticket for the Games and will therefore be traveling to Paris. We cannot let the threat of terrorism take away our freedom,"" she stressed.
Zagrodzki believes many Parisians will see things differently, particularly in view of the reported 10 million visitors expected to flood into the French capital — coupled with the planned security restrictions.
""I'm hearing people say: 'It's going to be hell!'"" he said.
""Many are hoping to rent out their apartments at a high price and travel until the Olympics are over.""

He cited deadly extremist attacks that hit Paris in 2015 as an example of the type of severe crisis that could force a rethink of the July 26 ceremony.
""You're 15 days from the Olympic Games. You have a series of terrorist attacks. What do you do? Well, you don't organize [a ceremony] on the Seine,"" he said in a television interview with France 5 on Wednesday.
""Since we are professional, there are obviously plan Bs, plan Cs, et cetera,"" Macron said. ""You have to be prepared for everything.""
Paris is due to host the Olympic Games from July 26 to August 11, 2024.
The opening ceremony is due to take place on the Seine instead of inside the Olympic stadium, and hundreds of thousands of people are expected to watch from the banks of the river that flows through Paris.
It would be the first Summer Games opening ceremony held outside of a usual stadium setting.
""We are preparing an opening ceremony that is unique, which I hope will make the French very proud,"" Macron told the public broadcaster. ""It will be a moment of beauty, of real art, of celebrating sport and our values, with the Seine and the capital as the theater.""

France raised its security alert to the highest level after a knife-wielding attacker stabbed a teacher to death outside a school in the north of the country in October.
Earlier this month, a German tourist was killed in a suspected terror attack close to the Eiffel Tower in central Paris. The perpetrator has reportedly pledged allegiance to the so-called ""Islamic State.""
Paris 2024 organizers ruled out a change of plans after that incident.
""There is no single fallback plan, but rather a variety of adaptation measures - what we call in our jargon contingency plans - which are not intended to be public in any other way,"" Paris 2024 said.

""The FIFA and UEFA rules making any new interclub football project subject to their prior approval, such as the Super League, and prohibiting clubs and players from playing in those competitions, are unlawful,"" the court said. ""There is no framework for the FIFA and UEFA rules ensuring that they are transparent, objective, non- discriminatory and proportionate.""
The court did, however, add that the ruling did not mean the Super League would be approved.
Case C-333/21 was brought by the Spain-based ""European Super League Company"" and the sports marketing agency ""A22,"" backed by Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus.
They had argued UEFA was in breach of European law by abusing its market dominance of competitions to ban the creation of an alternative continental football competition, the European Super League.
""UEFA organizes the competitions and at the same time can reject other competitions – that's a conflict of interest,"" A22 boss Bernd Reichart explained.
In a statement responding to the ruling, UEFA said: ""This ruling does not signify an endorsement or validation of the so-called ‘super league’; it rather underscores a pre-existing shortfall within UEFA's pre-authorization framework, a technical aspect that has already been acknowledged and addressed in June 2022.
""UEFA is confident in the robustness of its new rules, and specifically that they comply with all relevant European laws and regulations.""
In a statement responding the ruling, sports marketing agency A22, which represents those clubs still in favor of a Super League, said:
""The UEFA-monopoly is over. Football is free. Clubs are now free from the threat of sanction and free to determine their own futures.""
A22 CEO Bernd Reichart said new proposals for a Super League would be announced today, reported to be a midweek competition for both men's and women's football.
Promoters later announced plans for a '64 club' tournament with promotion and relegation with fans able to view live matches for free on a new digital streaming platform.
Unusually, the ECJ judges have ruled contrary to a prior non-binding recommendation made by an ""advocate general.""
Back in December 2022, Advocate General Athanasios Rantos of Greece had concluded that the actions of UEFA and FIFA were indeed compatible with European law. Not only that, he actually said the status quo should be strengthened.
He said that, although the Super League ought to be allowed to start its own operations in principle, the clubs should not be able to demand simultaneous participation in the associations' competitions if they refused to give their consent.
The exclusions from competitions for Super League clubs and their players envisaged by UEFA, FIFA and national associations would therefore be legally compliant, according to Rantos.
Unusually, however, the court has reached a different conclusion, potentially due to a lack of clarity over the ruling following several postponements or different advocate general now being in charge.
In April 2021, 12 clubs announced their intention to establish a European football Super League that would run alongside the UEFA Champions League and the continent's domestic competitions.
However, the vociferous opposition of fan groups, numerous national football associations and the European Club Association (ECA) quickly led to the plan being put on ice. European football's governing body UEFA announced that it would look into the possibility of barring the clubs behind the Super League concept from its competitions, including the Champions League.
The Madrid-based court then referred the case to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg, the highest judicial authority in Europe, which has now ruled in those clubs' favor.
As mentioned above, the ruling merely concerns the legality of UEFA's market position within European Law. It does not necessarily give a European Super League the green light. The Grand Chamber judgement’s interpretation of EU law will now be passed back to a Madrid commercial court to make a decision, after the Spanish jurisdiction made the referral in 2021.
Since the original breakaway attempt in April 2021, the European and global football landscape has changed somewhat.
Partly in an attempt to appease the Super League rebels, UEFA has signed off on a reformatted Champions League competition which will get underway next year. The traditional pre-Christmas group stage featuring several mini-leagues of four teams each is to be replaced by a ""Swiss model"" which will see all participating clubs compete in one single league table, playing more games against each other, before the majority of them progress to a knock-out stage.
In England meanwhile, the Premier League has just announced a new domestic television rights deal worth a record €7.73bn ($8.46bn) to its clubs. Any new Super League competition proposed by A22 would have to be seriously lucrative to convince the top English clubs.
Furthermore, English football’s new ""independent regulator"" established by the UK government partly in response to the original Super League breakaway attempt, is set to forbid clubs from joining unapproved competitions under its licensing conditions.
Elsewhere in Europe, it has also been reported that CVC, the private equity firm which has recently invested in France's Ligue 1, inserted a compensation clause into the deal to cover the eventuality of a French club participating in a new Super League.
In Germany, club ownership structures also constitute a major obstacle. Indeed, the Federal Competition Regulator (Bundeskartellamt) recently concluded that the so-called 50+1 club ownership rule, which stipulates that members retain majority voting rights in clubs and thus prevents majority takeovers, does not contravene German competition law.
However, the ECJ's ruling that UEFA's dominant position within the European market effectively constituted a monopoly could encourage opponents of the 50+1 rule to take a similar case to the European Court.
Nevertheless, Bayern Munich CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen said after the ruling a European Super League would be ""an attack on the importance of national leagues"", before reaffirming ""the door to the Super League remains closed at Bayern.""

https://www.dw.com/en/uefa-super-league-row-europes-top-court-to-rule/a-67768633,SOCCER,UEFA Super League row: Europe's top court to rule 19.12.2023,"In April 2021, 12 clubs announced their intention to establish a European football Super League that would run alongside the UEFA Champions League and the continent's domestic competitions. The idea was to guarantee that the best clubs in Europe would play against each other more often – for a lot of money.
However, the vociferous opposition of fan groups, numerous national football associations and the European Club Association (ECA) quickly led to the plan being put on ice.
Europe's football governing body UEFA announced that it would look into the possibility of barring the clubs behind the Super League concept from its competitions, including the Champions League. FIFA, the world governing body, also threatened sanctions and the exclusion of any player who appeared in Super League matches.
As a result, nine of the 12 clubs announced their intention to withdraw from the Super League, while the remaining three (Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus) obtained a temporary injunction against possible sanctions from a Spanish commercial court. This was overturned on appeal. The Madrid-based court then referred the case to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg, the highest judicial authority in Europe.
On Thursday, December 21, the ECJ is to hand down its ruling on case C-333/21, concerning the establishment of the Super League and possible consequences for the participating clubs. The defendants are UEFA and FIFA.
The court case was brought by the Spain-based ""European Super League Company"" and the sports marketing agency ""A22,"" backed by Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus.
They argue that UEFA enjoys a monopoly when it comes to organizing European football competitions and who is allowed to take part.
""UEFA organizes the competitions and at the same time can reject other competitions – that's a conflict of interest,"" A22 boss Bernd Reichart explained.
Before ECJ judges hand down a decision, the case in question is examined by an ""advocate general,"" who in turn publishes a recommendation. In his opinion, published in December 2022, Advocate General Athanasios Rantos of Greece argued that the actions of UEFA and FIFA were compatible with European law.
Although the Super League would be allowed to start its own operations in principle, the clubs would not be able to demand simultaneous participation in the associations' competitions if they refused to give their consent. The exclusions from competitions for Super League clubs and their players envisaged by UEFA, FIFA and national associations would therefore be legally compliant.
No, because the advocate general's proposal is not binding. The court is free to hand down a different verdict. However, in most cases in the past, the ECJ judges have followed the opinion of the advocate general involved.
Whether this will also be the case in the Super League dispute remains to be seen – especially as the ruling, which was supposed to be handed down last spring, has already been postponed several times. In the meantime, the advocate general responsible has also changed.  Maciej Szpunar of Poland has since replaced Rantos on this case.
The original plan was for an American-style closed league made up of 20 clubs. Now, though, the idea is for several divisions involving between 60 and 80 clubs, complete with promotion and relegation – as is the norm in Europe. Under the new format, all participants would be guaranteed a minimum of 14 European matches per year.
The revenue is to be distributed to all participating clubs. In addition, at least €400 million ($438 million) annually is to be made available for non-participating clubs and for social purposes. Access to the Super League would be via the national leagues.
UEFA believes that the danger of a Super League being founded is no longer very great following the opinion published by Advocate General Rantos one year ago. In a statement in response to the opinion, UEFA said it welcomed the support for ""our central mission to govern European football, protect the pyramid and develop the game across Europe.""
A22 appear equally confident. 
""We are fundamentally optimistic and have great confidence in the European legal system,"" A22 CEO Bernd Reichart told the DPA news agency. ""It is an important milestone because we will then find out whether the market will be opened up. If the ECJ makes it possible for the clubs to gain sovereignty over their own competition, they will also have a hand in it. I am convinced of that.""

https://www.dw.com/en/iran-women-attend-tehran-derby-but-equality-fight-goes-on/a-67750852,SOCCER,"Iran: Women attend Tehran derby, but equality fight goes on 18.12.2023","For the first time since the Iranian revolution 44 years ago, women were allowed to attend the Tehran derby. 
FIFA President Gianni Infantino hailed the admittance of 3,000 female football fans into the Azadi Stadium to watch the 1-1 draw between Persepolis FC and Esteghlal FC on Thursday as ""progress.""
However, for Iranian activist Maryam Shojaei, who founded the #Noban4Women movement, it was a far cry from the victory Infantino and others were celebrating.
""It's true, yes, this is the first time since the revolution that women were able to watch the derby in the stadium,"" Shojaei told DW.
""The more important thing is that the Football Federation of the Islamic Republic of Iran (FFIRI) still will not give up control completely. 
""To me, it's a question of ego. Even though they promised to FIFA and everybody that they would allow women to attend football matches freely, it is like somehow they still don't want to accept defeat,"" she said. 
""If you can give 3,000 tickets, they can give more in a stadium with a capacity of more than 78,000.""
For the women who did attend the derby, it was a special moment that went smoothly.
This came in stark contrast to March 2022, when women were barred from entering the Iranian men's World Cup qualifying game against Lebanon in Mashhad. Video footage later emerged from that game, showing female supporters being pepper-sprayed outside the stadium.
But while women were welcomed into the stadium in Tehran, they were forced to enter through a separate entrance from the men and sit in a cordoned-off section.
""I'm not announcing victory,"" Shojaei said. ""Of course, it was moving. I saw a picture of an old woman covering her body with a flag of her favorite team. After decades, she was able to go to the stadium.
""But we want what happens around the world, even in another Arab Muslim country like Saudi Arabia and other countries, where tickets are sold equally (to men and women)."" 
Part of this, the activist said, would be for a girl to sit and watch a game with her father. 
""Imagine in that big (Azidi) stadium that you have to go and watch the match on one side of the stadium, and your father is on the other side.""
Shojaei noted that while the campaigning of her and other Iranian activist groups had borne fruit just three months ago, she had still been writing letters to FIFA calling on them to enforce their own laws.
In 2019, football's governing body called on Iran to allow women into stadiums per the rules the FFIRI accepts as a member of FIFA. The alternative would have been to face a ban from international competition.
While the FFIRI may have complied with the rules on paper, they have continued to make excuses for excluding female fans at football matches — a difficult pill for Shojaei to swallow.
""For me personally, it's not just about the sport, it's about standing (up) for your rights,"" she said.
""It was a bittersweet experience watching those (women and girls) go to the stadium because I also think of all those, like Jina Mahsa Amini, who have died. And Sahar Khodayari (known as ""the blue-haired girl"") couldn't go there and watch the derby, and she was a big fan of one of those teams.
""Others, too, have paid the price. One girl is in exile in Turkey only because of trying to [go] to the stadium many times. She had to leave the country as if she had committed a crime,"" Shojaei said. ""So I'm happy, but at the same time, I thought about all the lost time (spent fighting for the right to attend a football match) and all the women who were not there.""
International scrutiny of the treatment of women has died down more than a year since Jina Mahsa Amini died in custody after being arrested by the Iranian ""morality police"" for incorrectly wearing her hijab.
However, Shojaei says that women continue to engage in active resistance, even if they do so out of view of the rest of the world. 
Describing a picture of a young girl who attended the Tehran derby, she spoke with pride of a fan wearing sweatpants, a sweatshirt and a woolly hat that left much of her hair showing.
""Girls inside Iran who are not even activists, just football fans, show up outside the stadiums for every game,"" she said, noting that the fight against the ban on attending football is just one part of a broad movement of civil resistance.
Another issue is the mandatory wearing of the hijab, which, Shojaei believes, the government is not willing to relent on for fear that this might open the door to other demands from Iranian women.
""If you walk the streets of Iran, you see there is resistance. There are millions of Iranian women in every single corner of Iran who don't cover their hair anymore,"" which Shojaei described as ""one of the biggest joys of my life.""
""I'm witnessing history,"" she said. ""Seeing these young teenagers gives me lots of energy and makes me proud of being (an) Iranian woman.""

https://www.dw.com/en/serbias-ruling-populists-claim-sweeping-election-victory/a-67747456,POLITICS,Serbia's ruling populists claim sweeping election victory 18.12.2023,"Serbia's governing populists claimed a sweeping victory in Sunday's snap parliamentary elections.
According to a near-complete preliminary tally published Monday by the state election commission, President Aleksandar Vucic's Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) won 47% of the vote.
The largest opposition group, Serbia Against Violence (SPN), picked up 23%.
Vucic's name was not on the ballot, as it was not a presidential election, but the vote was widely seen as a referendum on his leadership after a turbulent year for the country.
Tensions with neighboring Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008, have escalated. And two back-to-back mass shootings claimed the lives of 18 people in Serbia. 
The shootings rattled Vucic's support, yet his right-wing populist SNS maintained a commanding position following the vote.
""We will have an absolute majority in [the 250-seat] parliament with 127 seats,"" President Aleksandar Vucic told reporters. 
The Kremlin welcomed the result, saying Moscow hoped it would lead to the ""further strengthening of friendship"" between Russia and Serbia.
Some electoral observers and independent media reported irregularities on voting day.
One report claimed that ethnic Serbs from Bosnia and Herzegovina gathered to vote in a sports hall in Belgrade that was not an official polling station.
Observers from the Center for Research, Transparency and Accountability expressed ""the highest concern"" over allegations that illegal voters were bussed into Belgrade from other countries.
""The concentration of buses, minivans and cars was observed on several spots in Belgrade, transferring voters to polling stations across the city to vote,"" the civil society watchdog said.

Monitors, including some from the Organization for Security and Co-operation (OSCE), reported cases of ""vote buying"" and ""ballot box stuffing.""
""Election day was smooth but marred by isolated instances of violence, procedural irregularities and frequent allegations of organizing and busing of voters to support the ruling party in local elections,"" said a statement by the International Election Observation Mission.
The opposition said it would lodge official complaints and called for a street protest in Belgrade on Monday night.
Authorities have rejected claims of any wrongdoing, and acting Prime Minister Ana Brnabic dismissed the reports as ""lies that are intended to spread panic.""
The parliamentary vote coincides with local elections taking place in most municipalities, the capital Belgrade, and the northern province of Vojvodina.
The Belgrade vote is shaping up to be a crucial battleground between the SNS and the centrist SPN coalition.
The movement was formed in the wake of the mass shootings, which pushed hundreds of thousands of anti-government protesters to the streets for months.
Vucic has dismissed the rallies as a foreign plot, often warning that Serbia would be left directionless without him.
""It's not about me leaving power, but about them destroying everything,"" he told supporters at a recent rally. 
""It would take us 20 years to fix everything ... That's why we'll beat them more convincingly than ever.""

https://www.dw.com/en/why-people-love-and-hate-last-christmas/a-67711782,MUSIC,Why people love (and hate) 'Last Christmas' 17.12.2023,"It hits us without mercy every year, nearly impossible to avoid: It's on the radio, it's at the top of the singles charts, it's blaring from the loudspeakers at Christmas markets or supermarkets and department stores. No Yuletide playlist is complete without ""Last Christmas.""
Along with the original recording by British pop duo Wham!, there are endless cover versions to choose from, sung in Spanish, German, French, Italian, Japanese, Swedish, Portuguese and numerous language dialects. The musical styles of those covers range from salsa to metal, folk to R & B.  
New ones are being recorded all the time, most recently by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette.
The video for the original version tells a sentimental story: A group of friends gather for Christmas at a cozy chalet in the snowy mountains. There's an obvious tension and longing between one of the men (Wham! vocalist George Michael) and one of the women, both of whom have arrived with different people.
Through a flashback, we learn that the sparkly brooch worn by the woman's boyfriend (played by the other half of Wham!, Andrew Ridgeley), was given to her the previous Christmas by Michael. He, wounded by her careless handling of his heart, vows to only give it to someone special, hoping to spare himself further tears. 
This short-format drama is the height of 1980s kitsch — not just because of the main characters' yearning gazes, but also thanks to its lavish use of soft focus and the blow-dried hairstyles that were all the rage at the time.
Fun fact: The video was shot in the Swiss winter sports resort of Saas-Fee. But the chalet where the action is set is only seen in exterior shots. The cast and crew couldn't get in, because no one in the village had the key. So the interior shots were filmed in Saas-Fee's cultural center. 
According to pop music legend, in the summer of 1984, the then 21-year-old George Michael jotted down a few lines in a notebook as he and bandmate Ridgeley were on a bus on their way to visit Michael's parents. As Wham!, the duo were already in the pop charts, with their single ""Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"" having reached No. 1 in both the UK and the US.
But even pop stars can be lovelorn, and Michael decided to write a song inspired by his own heartbreak. As Ridgeley recalled in a November 2023 interview with Smooth Radio, Michael disappeared into his old room at his parents' house and emerged later as excited as if he'd discovered gold. Which he had: He played Ridgeley a melody that would become one of the best-known pop songs in the world. 
""George had performed musical alchemy, distilling the essence of Christmas into music,"" recounted Ridgeley. ""Adding a lyric which told the tale of betrayed love was a masterstroke and, as he did so often, he touched hearts."" The song was released on November 30, 1984, just in time for Christmas.
It quickly became clear that the song touched a nerve, expressing the pain of countless people spending the holiday season alone, mourning a lost love. The melody Michael wrote is so ingeniously catchy you can easily miss the fact that it consists of only four chords. 
That makes it an almost instant earworm, which has made the track not only one of the most-played Christmas songs of all time, but also — along with Mariah Carey's ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" — among the most annoying. It can hardly be avoided at this time of year, but that doesn't stop some people from trying.
In 2016, the comedy page ""Whamageddon"" on Facebook launched a challenge that has since spread far beyond the realm of that social media platform. To play, people do everything they can to avoid listening to the original Wham! version of the song (cover versions don't count) between December 1 and 24. If you make it to Christmas Eve without hearing it, you can say you survived ""Whamageddon."" Losers are sent to ""Whamhalla."" 
The rules state that deliberately playing the song to knock people out is frowned upon — as a DJ at a UK sports stadium learned recently when he played the song as a joke at a soccer game attended by some 7,000 people. He apologized after coming under fire, saying he hadn't realized people took the challenge so seriously.
It doesn't take a prankster to send you to ""Whamhalla,"" since the chances of hearing ""Last Christmas"" unintentionally are huge. In the first decades since its release it never quite made it to the very top spot in the charts, but that changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The song went to No. 1 in the UK on January 1, 2021, followed by Germany at the end of that year.
This year, too, it's in hot rotation on numerous radio stations — not to mention being used in countless social media reels. It's become harder than ever to avoid ""Last Christmas.""
Help comes in the form of radio stations like Germany's Radio Bob, which has declared itself a ""'Last Christmas'-free zone.""
Next year will mark 40 years since Wham! released ""Last Christmas,"" and its longevity and ubiquitousness are surely also due in part to the universal nature of its subject. Heartbreak on the holidays will exist for as long as people fall in love and celebrate Christmas.
George Michael's success went on long after that song. He was a talented and beloved musician, songwriter and performer, whose career survived the end of Wham! in 1986 and continued until his death. He died at the age of just 53, on Christmas Day, 2016.

https://www.dw.com/en/moldovan-school-fights-for-survival-with-eu-help/a-67746177,EDUCATION,Moldovan school fights for survival with EU help 16.12.2023,"Decent living conditions, better-paid jobs, a normal health care system, clean cities, a well-functioning infrastructure: These are just some of the things that people in the Republic of Moldova would like, and the reason why many would prefer to live in a different country.
Corruption and poverty are fueling people's desire to leave. Those who can often opt for the European Union, where they hope to find a better, more welcoming world. Those who are forced to stay are doing their best to make ends meet.
In the village of Drujba (which means friendship in Russian), not far from the border with Romania, a school is fighting for its survival. The village is relatively young; it was founded only 50 years ago, when Moldova was part of the Soviet Union. But there has been a steady population drain since the early 1990s after the fall of the communist regime, as people seek better lives elsewhere.
The local high school was converted into a kindergarten and elementary school of four classes in 1993.
There are currently only 29 pupils at the school, and thus a high risk that the establishment will be closed down. So, staff members are doing their best to prove that it can survive on minimal resources.
There are limited funds provided by the government for maintenance, and the school has not been able to attract any other project funding because of the small number of pupils. It was slated to be ""optimized,"" or closed, but before this happened, school director Angela Chitoraga contacted several embassies in the capital Chisinau, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) away, and asked them for help. 
And help came, including from Germany. ""As part of the 'New energy infrastructure for Drujba' project, the German embassy gave us 400,000 lei [around €20,000/$22,500] in financial support,"" Chitoraga told DW.
This money was used to install a photovoltaic system. The heating system was also modernized, and the walls thermally insulated. The school is currently the only public institution in the whole district that runs on solar power.
""I'm so proud about this project. Several educational establishments in the district called and asked me if it was true that we had a photovoltaic system. Nobody believed that such a small school could be saved,"" said Chitoraga.
Before, the kindergarten and school were spending around 100,000 lei (about €5,000) on electricity, wood and coal each year. Since the solar-powered system was introduced, there has been a significant reduction of expenses. The energy generated is used to heat the school, kindergarten, and library, as well as to prepare meals.
When energy consumption is low, during the summer vacations, for example, the surplus production is fed into the electricity grid, which generates additional income for the establishment. The school has been able to employ additional staff with the money saved.
There are 35 children in the kindergarten, while the school has five children in year one, seven in year two, eight in year three and nine in year four.
""It's not the children's fault that more and more families are leaving their village,"" said Chitoraga. ""But the children who live here want to learn! As these children are far away from the city, they are still marginalized and disadvantaged. They can't attend art or sports schools; they can't go to the theater or the cinema. They at least have the right to a school in their village.""
It's nice and warm in the kindergarten. The few children there have just eaten and are playing on the floor. Though they surely don't understand how the solar panels on the roof work in detail, they do know it is the sun that keeps them warm in summer, and now in winter. The teachers explain that they have taught the children about green energy and protecting the environment.
Locals were curious when the solar panels were installed, with many stopping by to see if they could put in similar systems to avoid using wood or coal to make fires. There is no gas supply to the village, and thus most households have a pile of wood waiting to be burned.

Employees from the company that installed the photovoltaic systems came to inform the villagers. During their breaks, the children would also listen in to find out just exactly how the panels on the roof could generate electricity and heat.
Ana Caracas, who lives directly opposite the school, works as a guard there. One of her boys is in first grade and another is in kindergarten. She said that lots of people showed interest in the solar panels after they were installed, but the price was usually too high and most could not afford to install such systems at home.
The school director's family is considering installing a photovoltaic system on their house in the spring. Chitoraga said her children, who volunteered abroad, had taught her that she had to actively look for projects that make a difference. Her main goal is to find ways to prevent her school from being closed down.
This year, she and another teacher attending a football training session so that she could acquire footballs for the school. ""Most of the people there were men but I played football with them and ended up bringing the kids back a whole sack of balls. Now they have something to play with,"" she said.
Chitoraga's son, who lives in France, also helps. Every year, he comes over with a group of volunteers, bringing school equipment and clothes for the children. When a big storm damaged the roof, he collected donations for a new one.
""I never thought that as a small village with a small school, we would receive so much help. It is an investment in the future of these children, in the future of this village and in the future of this country,"" said Chitoraga.

On December 11, 24 of 36 teams between the two divisions voted in favor of a plan to secure private equity investment in return for a share of TV rights over the next two decades.
Fans from all 36 teams announced they would remain silent for the first 12 minutes of their matches across the weekend, with multiple matches interrupted by further protests.
Union Berlin fans went on to throw tennis balls and chocolate coins on the pitch, forcing a short interruption of their match at VfL Bochum.
Striker Takuma Asano ate one of the chocolate coins during the cleanup, and went on to Bochum's opener shortly before the break.
Protests on Friday had a more serious outcome, with the game between second division sides Paderborn and Hansa Rostock interrupted after Rostock fans threw pyrotechnics onto the pitch.
Rostock fans and police officers were also injured, and there was an estimated damage of €100,000 ($109,085) reported by Paderborn.
""A total of eight stewards and 12 police officers suffered injuries, one policewoman had to be treated in the hospital for a cut,"" Paderborn and the police said in a joint statement.
""It's not enough to apologize and distance ourselves, there will be severe punishment. We will have to talk about clear consequences,"" Rostock CEO Robert Marien told the Bild newspaper on Saturday. 
Elsewhere on Friday, the start of the Bundesliga clash between Borussia Mönchengladbach and Werder Bremen was  delayed for five minutes after fans threw fake coins on the pitch. This came in addition to the 12 minutes of silence at the start of the match.
""It was no fun at all, it reminded me of the coronavirus,"" Bremen midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt said of the fans' silence, referring to the games played with no paying spectators during the pandemic.
The DFL have said they are aiming to boost its business model and international marketing with the income they will receive from the strategic partner, who will have no saying in sporting matters such as fixtures lists.

Crowds streamed toward the Belgrade Arena, one of Europe's largest sports venues, to attend the main election rally of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) . One man commanded all the attention: Serbia's autocratic president, Aleksandar Vucic.
""Our village leader organized the trip to Belgrade,"" said one man sitting on a nearby bench, swigging from a beer can. He said he was from a village in the country's north. ""Of course I support Vucic. He gave us all money, most recently 10,000 dinars (€85/$94) for welfare recipients,"" he told DW.
Election gifts are common in Serbia. This time, Vucic decided to make one-off state budget payments to pensioners, young people and the unemployed ahead of the parliamentary and local elections on December 17. Sometimes, these payments amount to 10,000 dinars, other times a little more or a little less.
For many in Serbia, this is a lot of money. After all, the average Serbian salary is only €725 (about $800) after taxes, and an average €330 ($360) for pensioners.
Vucic has promised to raise pensions in January, provided his party wins the election. The president himself is not standing for election, as he secured a second term in office last year. That said, this entire election revolves around him. Every SNS electoral list, even in the smallest village, bears his name.
Belgrade weekly magazine Vreme has described Vucic as the ""beggar king,"" saying he casts himself as a man of the people who distributes money, builds roads and railroads and creates jobs.
The opposition, in turn, has accused Vucic of ruling Serbia with an iron fist and playing off the European Union, Russia and China against each other. Critics have said Vucic's government maintains close ties with the mafia, and is deeply corrupt. Yet in his near daily television appearances, Vucic has accused his critics of being traitors and thieves desperate to take power.
At the election rally at Belgrade Arena, Vucic boomed: ""Serbia is one of the few countries in Europe today that has an independent agenda."" But despite the roaring applause that filled the venue, not everyone here attended out of their own volition.

A young man who said he works in a hospital in a small town told DW he was pressured into attending the rally. To keep their jobs, he and his colleagues were forced to attend the rally and vote for SNS.
 ""It's disastrous, but what can I do?"" he said.
Recent polls have shown that SNS in the lead. Although the party is unlikely to secure a landslide victory, it should be enough for SNS to continue its coalition with the Socialists and other smaller parties.
The main opposition, the pro-European Serbia Against Violence bloc, hopes to take second place in the election after the SNS. It was formed after two mass shootings in May 2023 shook the country to the core, sparking mass protests. The alliance has accused Vucic and his media outlets of fueling a violent atmosphere by broadcasting questionable reality shows and lambasting the opposition.

Pervasive violence and abuse of power are the most important issues ahead of the election, political scientist Srdjan Cvijic told DW. Serbia's opposition has stopped making the country's EU accession a campaign promise, in part because the process is taking too long.
""Putting the EU issue at the forefront would be political kamikaze,"" Cvijic told DW. ""All pro-government media outlets are spreading anti-Western vitriol. What good does it do the opposition to be pilloried for this, too?""
The EU is also losing popularity in Serbia because of disagreements over Kosovo. Serbia does not recognize the independence of the former southern province, despite pressure from Berlin and Brussels.
According to the 2013 Brussels Agreement, Serbia should recognize Kosovar documents and stop blocking Kosovo's path to UN membership. Pristina, in return, is to allow a Serbian association of municipalities in Kosovo.
Right-wing conservative and nationalist splinter parties, constituting the third key player in the elections, are campaigning on the Kosovo issue alone. They have accused Vucic of practically giving up Kosovo by signing off on various agreements.
Yet Vucic's biggest problems are connected to Russia's war in Ukraine, said Belgrade historian and political analyst Stefan Radojkovic. Serbia has one of the highest inflation rates in Europe, owing to high fuel costs, which undermines Vucic's narrative of economic success. Also, the EU and US want to maintain control in the Balkans and force Serbia into reaching a compromise with Kosovo, Radojkovic told DW.
There is relatively little campaigning to be seen in Belgrade, with only a few billboards here and there. And the SNS is almost the only party with enough cash to pay for television ads.
A recent petition by the ProGlas pro-democracy movement did, however, cause a stir. Dozens of intellectuals, actors and athletes called on Serbians to cast their ballots on December 17. Around 170,000 people signed the petition online.
""We don't have a reasonable state in Serbia, "" Vladica Cvetkovic, a well-known professor who was one of the first to sign the petition, told DW. ""We lack democracy, justice and equality, we can only change that if we raise our voices.""
The election will be a tight race, especially in Belgrade. Polls suggest the opposition could triumph in the capital, which would be seen as an important symbol. After all, former autocrat and warlord Slobodan Milosevic also lost Belgrade and other major cities in 1996, before being voted out of office in 2000. Both times, Milosevic only gave in after continuous protests. At the time, Vucic served as his information minister.
Yet many things would have to fall into place for Vucic to lose power. Pro-European and pro-Russian forces would, for instance, need to form a coalition against Vucic. But looking back at the 1990s should make one cautious, Sofija Mandic, a lawyer who sits on the election committee on behalf of the opposition, told DW
There is considerable evidence the government is preparing to commit election fraud, Mandic told DW. ""Voters must be able to freely express themselves,"" she said. ""And they must be prepared to stand up for their political beliefs aside from voting, if necessary.""

https://www.dw.com/en/ukrainian-sports-minister-calling-russian-athletes-neutral-means-supporting-murder/a-67733566,SPORTS,Ukrainian sports minister: Calling Russian athletes 'neutral means supporting murder' 15.12.2023,"Ukraine's acting sports minister believes the decision of Vladislav Larin, a Russian taekwondo fighter, to appear in a video that calls on residents of his home region to donate money for medicine and ammunition for Russia's invasion of Ukraine should cost him a spot at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.
""He is an example of the complicity of Russian athletes and Russian occupiers,"" Matviy Bidnyi said in an exclusive interview with DW. ""Even if athletes in no way expressed their opinion about the war, they express silent solidarity with the killers.""
Larin, a gold medalist at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, said in the video: ""Friends, let's unite and help those who are defending our motherland.""
The 28-year-old was banned for three months by his sport's governing body, World Taekwondo, which said it ""accepted"" his testimony. Larin, who couldn't be reached for comment, secured his Paris berth at the season-ending Grand Slam Champions Series in China on December 16.
The IOC will permit individual Russian and Belarusian athletes to take part in the Paris Olympics as neutrals — without their national flag or anthem — as long as they haven't actively supported the war or aren't contracted to the military.
However, Bidnyi said any neutral athlete who participates will be a ""resource and a tool for Russian propaganda.""
""When one nation has unleashed the largest aggressive war in Europe since World War II and is trying to destroy another nation, calling these people neutral means supporting murder.""
In all its recent communication, the IOC has sought to play up the ""peace mission"" of the Olympic Games. In early December, it held a flurry of meetings and consultations to prepare the ground for its decision.
During a conference call with athlete representatives, for example, Cheick Cisse, the head of World Taekwondo's athletes' committee, welcomed Larin's return to competition, saying it ""corresponded to the spirit of the Olympics,"" according to people on the call.
For Vladyslav Heraskevych, a Ukrainian skeleton racer who has campaigned for the total exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from international sport, such statements invite ridicule.
""If these athletes are allowed to participate in the Olympic Games, will there be a spirit of peace and friendship at the competition?"" he wrote in a message to DW.
""Or will the Olympics and all athletes be involved in the propaganda of war? Do we, as the Olympic movement, want to be associated with terrorism? The admission of these athletes will [create] a strong crack in the values that we stand for.""

Cases like Larin's underscore the problems the IOC is likely to face in the lead-up to the Paris Games. Even when Russian and Belarusian athletes have been cleared to compete by their sports, questions persist about their connections to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine.
To ensure those athletes meet its eligibility criteria, the IOC has said it will draw on information from each sport's governing body, as well as seeking an ""independent evaluation"" of each qualified neutral athlete.
Pressed for more detail by DW, an IOC spokesperson said the organization's vetting process would be ""on top of"" what the international federations have done, stressing the need for ""consistency"" across all sports. The spokesperson wouldn't speculate on specific cases or situations, including sanctioning the same athlete twice, saying only: ""We'll handle it when it comes our way.""
While Russia continues to maintain that the criteria are ""unacceptable,"" sports minister Bidnyi — who hasn't ruled out a Ukrainian boycott of the Games — said Ukraine will do ""everything possible to make the International Olympic Committee listen to common sense.""
""We will prove that the vast majority of Russian athletes are connected to the bloody regime,"" he said. ""Russian athletes have the same passports as Russian occupiers who are killing Ukrainians.""

Only seven Russian athletes have qualified for Paris so far. That includes four wrestlers, two of whom — Olympic champions Zaurbek Sidakov and Zavur Uguev ― have also been accused of supporting Russia's invasion by attending a televised pro-war rally in Moscow last year.
Explaining why it hadn't stopped them from taking part in Olympic qualifying competitions, United World Wrestling told The Associated Press in September that their ""participation in certain events is not [of] their own will.""
Skeleton racer Heraskevych pointed to this as another example of a governing body failing to follow what he considers ""weak IOC guidelines,"" which he said discriminate against Ukrainian athletes.
With teams from Russia and Belarus not allowed, the IOC has suggested that ""only a very limited number"" of neutral athletes will get to Paris. Some estimates have said the final number will be in the dozens, nowhere near the 300-plus who turned out in Tokyo.

https://www.dw.com/en/bundesliga-deal-what-does-private-equity-want-in-football/a-67732274,SPORTS,Bundesliga deal: What does private equity want in football? 15.12.2023,"The vote was close but, at the second time of asking, the German Football League (DFL) this week finally secured the two-thirds majority required to enter into negotiations with a ""strategic partner"" from the private equity sector with whom it hopes it will be able to boost the value of its international broadcasting rights.
Of the 36 clubs which make up the Bundesliga and Bundesliga 2, the two top divisions of German football, 24 voted in favor of handing DFL co-CEOs Steffen Merkel and Marc Lenz a mandate to negotiate a deal which could see up to €1 billion ($1.08 billion) of investment in digitalization, internationalization and global marketing in return for an 8% share of TV rights revenues over a period of 20 years.
The four front-runners interesting in sealing a deal with the DFL are all from the private equity sector: Blackstone, Advent, EQT and CVC.
Private equity firms set up funds and raise money from wealthy individuals and institutional investors such as pension funds. They usually buy companies and bring in managers who increase efficiency, often by aggressive cost-cutting and restructuring.
""After about five years, they try to sell them again for a large profit,"" explained Michael Grote, professor at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management and director at its Institute for Private Equity and Mergers and Acquisitions.
According to unconfirmed media reports, EQT from Sweden has offered to pay €1 billion for a 7.9% stake in DFL's yet to be set up marketing firm, DLF Media. Luxembourg-based CVC is said to want 8% for the same amount, while the offers of Blackstone and Advent seem be less than €1 billion.
CVC is no stranger to investments in global sports, having already negotiated similar deals with France's Ligue 1 and Spain's La Liga, plus Premiership and Six Nations Rugby, the Women's Tennis Association and Indian Premier League cricket franchise Gujarat Titans in recent years.
""Sports is an asset class that has not attracted too many investments until now,"" said Grote, suggesting that some European football leagues are not making the most of their potential when compared to other sporting competitions around the world.
""There's more turnover possible than is currently being realized. That makes it a particularly interesting target for private equity, so they can level up management and increase returns.""
Kieran Maguire, lecturer in football finance at the University of Liverpool in the UK, agrees.
""Private equity funds are particularly interested in football because it is seen as part of an entertainment industry in which prices for theaters, musicals, concerts etc. are going through the roof, and they believe there is room for such increases in football, too,"" he told DW.
""The value of NFL and NBA franchises in the United States is far higher than most European football clubs, so there's a view that, given that football is a vastly more popular game globally, it could potentially be worth even more.""
So far, so logical. But the deal which Germany's DFL is now hoping to secure, with stringent ""red lines” restricting investor influence to financial matters and preventing an investor from having any say on sporting or competition issues, is unusual from a private equity point of view.
""Typically, a private equity firm would own the whole company they invest in and they would have a very active hand in it, but this will not be the case with the DFL, so they won't be able to decide anything without the clubs' consent,"" said Grote. ""Nevertheless, it's in all parties' interest to increase the Bundesliga's market share globally and they will bring good ideas to the table.""
And Maguire has an inkling as to what those ideas might look like.
""We saw with the proposed private equity financing of the Super League [the European Super League is a planned breakaway competition, and the initial project was scrapped in 2021 — Editor's note] that they were keen to suggest splitting matches into four quarters, global TV-friendly kickoff times and games abroad, so these sorts of ideas will surely be dropped into the conversation in German football, even if they can't directly force any such ideas through.""
Another unusual element of the deal is the length of the proposed engagement.
Traditionally, private equity firms will look to take over a business and sell it on within three to five years, but the proposed DFL engagement is set to last 20 years. CVC's deal with La Liga is over 50 years.
""This is an untypical case for private equity,"" said Grote. ""However, the share of untypical private equity deals has risen. Investing in infrastructure over the course of long-term investments, investing in anything that delivers constant returns — this is becoming a new normal.""
Given the unique structure of German football, Grote considers private equity investment a logical step. ""With 36 different stakeholders, coordination is a major problem,"" he said. ""Investing in the Bundesliga is a risky endeavor, and bank loans will be either very expensive or not feasible.""
The DFL consists of 36 independent clubs, the vast majority of which are bound by the so-called 50+1 rule, which stipulates that the clubs themselves must retain majority voting rights in the commercial companies which generally run their professional football operations. Great for the fans, who can ensure that their matchday experience remains affordable and prevent their clubs simply being sold off to the highest bidder, but a turnoff for investors.
After recent attempts to challenge the legality of the 50+1 rule on competition grounds failed, the DFL has committed to the regulation and insists that a private equity deal at league level actually helps protect and preserve member-control at club level. ""If this deal goes well, both clubs and private equity will understand each other better,"" said Grote.
Maguire is also confident that the deal will achieve its aims in bringing about an increase in the value of the DFL's international TV right, but said any attempt to eat into the Premier League's advantage is going to be ""very difficult.""
""The Premier League horse hasn't just bolted; it's emigrated and started a new life far, far away,"" he said.
According to Maguire, Premier League clubs have been doing overseas tours for decades, and have the advantage of the English language, making them the first choice for football fans in most countries.
For German clubs, competing for attention will be hard. ""Fans only have a limited number of 90-minute slots available per weekend and once they've been locked into the Premier League ecosystem, watching Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea on a regular basis, where is the room in their life to watch Werder Bremen vs. Eintracht Frankfurt?""
Maguire added: ""It will be very difficult, in my view, even for the skills and wily ways of private equity to break into that market.""

https://www.dw.com/en/uk-prince-harry-partially-wins-phone-hacking-lawsuit/a-67732640,LAW AND JUSTICE,UK: Prince Harry partially wins phone-hacking lawsuit 15.12.2023,"Britain's Prince Harry on Friday gained a partial victory in his lawsuit against a newspaper publisher over allegations of phone hacking and other unlawful acts.
The High Court in London ruled that Harry was a victim of unlawful information gathering by Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN).
The judge sided with the UK royal on 15 of the 33 articles in the lawsuit and awarded him 140,000 pounds (€163,000, $179,000) in damages. The prince had sought 440,000 pounds.
The court ruled Harry has been a victim of ""modest"" phone-hacking and other unlawful information gathering by journalists at MGN.
Piers Morgan, the former editor of the British tabloid Daily Mirror who now works for News Corp's Talk TV and writes articles for its papers, knew about phone hacking at the newspaper — according to the judge.
Morgan has always denied any involvement in, or knowledge of, phone-hacking or other illegal or unlawful activity.
He said on Friday: ""I've never hacked a phone or told anybody else to hack a phone and nobody has produced any actual evidence to prove that I did.""
Speaking outside his London home, Morgan added: ""I wasn't called as a witness... by either side in the case, nor was I asked to provide any statement. I would have very happily agreed to do either or both of those things had I been asked.""
Justice Timothy Fancourt found that phone hacking was ""widespread and habitual"" at Mirror Group Newspapers over many years and private investigators ""were an integral part of the system"" to gather information unlawfully.
He said executives at the papers were aware of the practice and covered it up.
Harry had claimed he was targeted by MGN for 15 years from 1996 and that more than 140 stories that appeared in its papers were the result of unlawful information gathering. The trial only considered 33 of these.
The prince became the first senior royal to appear as a witness in court for 130 years at the trial in June.
The UK royal family has traditionally shied away from litigation but Harry has been outspoken in his criticism of the UK media's tactics in obtaining exclusive stories.
The other claimants included actors, sports stars, celebrities and people who simply had a connection to high-profile figures who had stories published.
In a statement read by his lawyer, the prince said he was happy to have won the lawsuit, calling the outcome ""vindicating and affirming.""
""I've been told slaying dragons will get you burned. But in light of today's victory and the importance of doing what is needed for a free and honest press — it's a worthwhile price to pay. The mission continues.""
""I respectfully call on the authorities, financial regulator and the police to do their duty, to investigate and bring charges against the Daily Mirror Group [MGN],"" Harry said.
A spokesperson for MGN reacted to the ruling by saying, ""gives the business the necessary clarity to move forward from events that took place many years ago."" 
""Where historical wrongdoing took place, we apologize unreservedly, have taken full responsibility and paid appropriate compensation.""

""A lot of the people that accuse us of that haven't been to Saudi, or seen what we are doing,"" Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud recently told the BBC. Depending on how you interpret the government's decisions, the immense amount of financial investment in sport is just part of the country's ""Vision 2030"" plan created by the crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman to modernise the country and make it less dependent on oil income. 
Bin Salman is the chairman of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund PIF (Public Investment Fund), that according to reports has made as much as $778 billion (€710 billion) available for investment. Some of its highest-profile acquisitions to date have been in sport. For years, the PIF has been pumping money into sport, such as in LIV golf, Formula One and also football. 
In 2021, PIF purchased an 80% stake in Premier League club Newcastle United. Since last June, the sovereign wealth fund also controls 75% of the shares of top domestic clubs Al-Ittihad, Al-Nassr, Al-Hilal and Al-Ahli, which made the spectacular arrivals of Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and Karim Benzema possible.
With his team Al-Ittihad, Frenchman Benzema is at the Club World Cup, the tournament in which all continental champions play against one another. This year is the final time the competition will be played in its current format, with the 2025 edition in the USA set to be played with 32 teams.
Favorites to win the final on December 22 are Champions League winners Manchester City, who are hoping Erling Haaland returns from injury. 
Human Rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have for years accused those in power in Riyadh of attempting to distract from blatant human rights abuses by hosting prestigious sporting events such as the Club World Cup.
""The human rights situation in Saudi Arabia is worsening in many different ways,"" said the interim Amnesty Director Stephen Cockburn. ""Repression is on the rise, especially against those who dare to criticise the authorities.""
FIFA President Gianni Infantino has no problem with Saudi Arabia hosting the tournament.
""This tournament in Saudi Arabia will be the best FIFA Club World Cup ever and will inspire boys and girls, men and women all over the world,"" said Infantino back in September when the draw for the competition was made. But Saudi Arabia's biggest coup is yet to come. The Gulf State is also set to host the 2034 World Cup.
Saudi Arabia is now the only country applying to host the competition, something made possible after the 2030 tournament was awarded to three continents at once and following the withdrawal of the Asian association's application for the 2034 tournament.
The approval of the FIFA Congress in the final quarter of 2024 appears a mere formality after Infantino announced Saudi Arabia as hosts on social media.
""The next tournaments will be as follows —  2030 in Africa (Morocco), Europe (Portugal, Spain) and three anniversary games in South America (Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay) and in 2034 in Asia (Saudi Arabia),"" he wrote on Instagram.

https://www.dw.com/en/enzo-ferrari-a-life-of-triumph-and-tragedy-hits-big-screen/a-67624953,FILM,Enzo Ferrari: A life of triumph and tragedy hits big screen 13.12.2023,"""If you get into one of my cars, you get in to win,"" Enzo Ferrari says in a new movie about the entrepreneur and founder of the Scuderia Ferrari Grand Prix motor racing team.
Ferrari's determination to win did have a price, though. He and his team faced financial ruin, and some of his drivers paid with their lives in the race to finish first.
Directed by Michael Mann and written by Troy Kennedy Martin, ""Ferrari"" is based on the 1991 biography ""Enzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races, the Machine"" by Brock Yates. The sports drama follows the personal and professional struggles of Enzo Ferrari, played by the aptly named Adam Driver.
Those struggles include the death of his son Dino, his deteriorating marriage with his wife Laura, portrayed in the film by Penelope Cruz, and his company's potential bankruptcy.
Born in Modena in northern Italy in 1898, Enzo Ferrari grew up with little formal education. A seminal moment occurred when he was just 10 years old, as he witnessed Felice Nazzaro win at the 1908 Circuito di Bologna. The event had a profound effect on Enzo, and inspired him to one day become a racing driver.
World War I would delay those ambitions, as Enzo served under the 3rd Mountain Artillery Regiment of the Italian Army. Though Enzo survived the war, he endured the loss of both his older brother, Alfredo Jr., and his father, Alfredo, with the pair dying due to a flu outbreak in Italy in 1916.
Enzo himself would be struck down during the 1918 flu pandemic and was consequently discharged from the Italian military.
A year later, Enzo fulfilled his dream of becoming a racing driver, and in 1920 joined the Alfa Romeo team.
But it wouldn't be long before he experienced tragedy again, with the deaths of two racing pioneers, Ugo Sivocci in 1923 and Antonio Ascari in 1925. Deeply affected by the loss of his good friends and colleagues, Enzo Ferrari went on racing half-heartedly, and started looking more towards the organizational aspects of motor racing. 
The birth of his son Dino in 1932 led him to retire from racing. From then on, he rather concentrated on managing his team of superstar drivers, called Scuderia Ferrari, which Enzo had founded in 1929. 
""Ford v Ferrari"" (titled ""Le Mans '66"" in the UK and other territories) is a new sports biopic about a team of US engineers who challenged in 1966 Ferrari, the perennial winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the world's oldest active endurance sports car race. Starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, it portrays the golden era of sports racing and how the will of individuals can beat bureaucracy.










While still working with Alfa Romeo, the Ferrari brand did emerge in the 1930s, with the now famous Prancing Horse logo beginning to show up on the cars.
With the outbreak of World War II, Ferrari's factory was forced to undertake war production for Mussolini's fascist government. After relocating from Modena to Maranello in 1943, the factory bombed during by the Allies, but the rebuilt workshop and remains the home of the Formula One team to this day.
After the war, Ferrari decided to start making cars bearing his name, produced for the Ferrari S.p.A. company, which he had founded in 1939.
When the first season of the Formula One World Drivers' Championship took place in 1950, the Ferrari team was an obvious entrant. Within two years they had their first world champion driver in Alberto Ascari (the son of late Antonio Ascari), and the Ferrari legend was born.
There would be trouble ahead, though, as portrayed in the film, set in 1957.
He was still devastated by his son Dino's early death in 1956, at the age of 24, from the degenerative disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The loss didn't help his rocky relationship with his wife Laura. 
It is also around that same period that his empire began to crumble. Financial ruin was on the horizon. 
""How?"" Enzo asks incredulously in the movie, highlighting a sense of losing touch with reality.
""You spend more than you make,"" comes the dry response from his financial advisor.
While his feet may not always have been on the ground, keeping four wheels on the asphalt was an obsession that was only bettered by his desperation to go faster.
That same year, Ferrari had one last throw of the dice, entering his racing team to the 1957 Mille Miglia, a race held on a course totaling roughly 1500 km — or a thousand Roman miles — made up entirely of public roads around Italy. 
At the iconic race, the victory delivered by driver Piero Taruffi (played in the biopic by Patrick Dempsey) saved the team from bankruptcy.
But again, the price was a hefty one, as the race was marred by the death of Alfonso de Portago and his co-driver, as well as 10 spectators, including five children, after his Ferrari 335 S crashed near the village of Guidizzolo. A tyre had burst while driving along a dead straight road at 250 kilometers per hour (160 mph), flinging Portago's Ferrari into the air, toward the watching audience.
Three days after the race, the Italian government put an end to the Mille Miglia and banned all motor racing on the public roads of Italy. Enzo Ferrari was charged with manslaughter, though he was finally dismissed in 1961.
The focus on this period in Ferrari's life would appear to be a logical one, as it brings to a head the tumultuous life of the car manufacturer, in the form of controversy, death, tragedy, and a win-at-all-costs mentality that still lives on in the sport today.

https://www.dw.com/en/when-sporting-passion-turns-to-addiction/a-67688069,SPORTS,When sporting passion turns to addiction 13.12.2023,"Eleven hours, 21 minutes and 15 seconds — that's how long it took Flora Colledge from jumping into the Hardangerfjord in Norway to celebrating at the top of the 1,883 meter Gaustatoppen mountain.
""It was a dream come true,"" the 37-year-old Briton said of her Norseman triathlon victory this year. ""It was my fifth attempt to win this event.""
After two second-place finishes in 2019 and 2021, Colledge finally reached the top of the podium and can now call herself a XTri world champion. XTri stands for extreme triathlon and along with the distance of an Ironman race — 3.8km swim, 180 km cycle and a 42.4km run — is the extra challenge of the course. In the Norseman, around 3,000 metres of altitude have to be overcome on the bike and it's more than 1800 metres in the marathon.
Flora Colledge is not just an extreme athlete though, but also a sports scientist who is currently researching the phenomenon of sports addiction, specifically looking at the ideas of compulsiveness, excessive sporting activity and a behavioural addiction.
""I didn't start looking at it because I had the feeling that I would be at risk myself. The topic chose me,"" Colledge tells DW and laughs. ""As an athlete at a high level, I find it exciting to explore the differences between sports addiction as a disorder and training with a high workload in a healthy way.""
Colledge herself trains around 25 hours a week. In her research, she has identified a mark of around seven hours a week as the threshold for a possible sports addiction.
""For someone who has a full-time job, a family and other commitments, one hour a day is not a small amount. If they still do sport and neglect other commitments to do so, you can talk about sports addiction from around seven hours of training per week,"" explains the scientist, who works at the University of Lucerne in Switzerland.
The phenomenon of sports addiction was discovered in passing in 1970. The New York doctor Frederick Baekeland wanted to investigate whether a lot of exercise promoted deep sleep. To this end, he offered money to passionate runners who trained daily. In return, they were to give up their sport for a month. Most of them refused, even when the scientist offered them large sums of money. Baekeland coined the term ""exercise addiction"". There are now more than 1,000 scientific articles on the phenomenon, and research has really taken off in the last five years.
In contrast to gambling and betting addiction, sports addiction is not yet recognised as an independent psychiatric disorder. Colledge admits that some studies should be treated with caution, stating that some forms of measurement used to identify sports addiction are ""far too simple"".
In a frequently used questionnaire, athletes are asked whether they have increased their training workload and whether they use sport to improve their mood. These are two of six questions. ""An athlete will clearly answer yes to both questions,"" explains Colledge. ""Of course you increase your training workload. And it's no problem at all that physical activity leads to a good mood. That's why we recommend sport.""

But when does passion start to become addiction?
""Sport can play a central role in life, but it shouldn't be the only priority,"" says Colledge. People who are committed to sport have clear goals but, unlike addicts, can also cope well with breaks from training.
""Taking a day off is fine and does not lead to withdrawal symptoms. Sports addicts, on the other hand, report severe anxiety and severe depressive symptoms and even suicidal thoughts if they are unable to exercise regularly,"" says Colledge. This inner compulsion to exercise at all costs and never to reduce the intensity is one of the main warning signals.
That's why amateur athletes are potentially at even more risk.
""Professional athletes generally understand that you don't just get fitter through training, but that you also need recovery phases to compensate for the intensive training phases,"" says Colledge, who has a professional triathlon licence herself. ""Sports addicts don't understand this. It's not about getting better, faster or fitter, it's just about completing a daily training programme. And that shouldn't be less tomorrow than it is today, maybe even a bit more.""
Opinions differ among scientists as to how many active people are addicted to sport. Endurance sports are considered to be particularly at risk. In 2022, for example, researchers identified a high risk of sports addiction among cyclists at six per cent. The risk among marathon runners was just under seven per cent.
However, a high risk does not necessarily mean a pathological disorder. An estimate by Simone Breuer and Jens Kleinert from the German Sports University of Cologne is often quoted in this context. According to this estimate, around one in a hundred athletes exhibits isolated abnormalities, one in a thousand tangible signs of a disorder. And one in ten thousand is probably in need of treatment. This also applies, for example, when symptoms of an eating disorder coincide with those of a sports addiction.
""It becomes pathological when sport has become a psychological burden,"" says Flora Colledge, citing the following example to highlight the point at which people should seek treatment. ""I don't actually have time for two hours of training today because I have to work or look after my family. But I do it anyway, even between two and four in the morning if necessary, because there's no other way.""
People who simply ignore illnesses or injuries and continue to train are also in need of treatment, says the sports scientist. ""There are sports addicts who carry on despite a fatigue fracture or high fever. They are no longer able to listen to their body.""
How do you treat a behavioural addiction that is not yet officially recognised as a psychiatric disorder?
""We are still at such an early stage of research that we haven't even been able to test forms of therapy,"" replies Colledge. ""There is no clinical trial for sports addiction therapy.""
However, there is evidence that so-called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be helpful. ""You learn to deal with your feelings about sport in a different way.

https://www.dw.com/en/how-nigerias-victor-osimhen-became-africas-best-footballer/a-67696441,SOCCER,How Nigeria's Victor Osimhen became Africa's best footballer 12.12.2023,"Five years ago, Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen was let go after failing to impress at Bundesliga side Wolfsburg, but on Monday night, he won the most prominent individual men's prize in African football, the CAF Footballer of the Year award.
""It's a dream come true for me,"" Osimhen said after beating out Egypt's Mohamed Salah and Morocco's Achraf Hakimi to the golden ball at a lavish ceremony in Marrakesh, Morocco. 
""I appreciate Nigerians for their support. I appreciate Africa for putting me on the map, encouraging me and defending me, regardless of my shortcomings.""
But the story could have been very different.
Osimhen grew up in poverty in Olusosun, a run-down neighborhood in Nigeria's commercial capital of Lagos. The pungent smell of the nearby landfill was a constant in the life of the young footballer, whose mother died when he was a young boy. As the youngest child, he was raised by his father and supported by his oldest brother, Andrew, who sold newspapers to help him achieve his dreams of playing football.
His first pair of football boots were picked up from the Olusosun dumpsite, and he dreamed of playing among the elite like his idol, the Chelsea and Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba. He sold bags of water and snacks in Lagos traffic and worked as a laborer carrying mixed concrete on his head at a construction site near his home. Poverty toughened him up.
""The place where I came from, nothing is promised,"" Osimhen said in a recent interview. ""I am so happy about my breakthrough because nobody gave me a chance of making it out of the trenches. Not just me but my whole family. For me to work my way up, I have shown the kids there that when you work hard and you're focused, anything is possible with God.""
Coach Emmanuel Amuneke was one of the first to spot his talents, selecting him for Nigeria at the FIFA U17 World Cup 2015 in Chile. The lanky striker took his chance and scored ten goals in seven matches to lead Nigeria to their fifth title, but his family was so poor that they had to go to a neighbor's house to watch the live matches.
Amuneke remembered how Osimhen stood out from hundreds of other players. ""I think for Victor, probably because of the [tough] early life that he spent when he was young, that helped him,"" said Amuneke at the beginning of this year. ""He's someone that wanted to succeed. Even when you look at him today with Napoli, he doesn't like to lose. He always wants to win, one quality that singles Victor out.""
When major European clubs, including Arsenal, tried to sign him, he and his family chose Wolfsburg for the calm environment and the club's ability to develop young players. But a series of injuries limited him to 14 Bundesliga games without a goal before he was shipped off on loan to Charleroi in Belgium.
""Wolfsburg condemned him,"" his older brother Andrew told DW. ""They said he was not fit, that he was not good. But Charleroi gave him that platform."" Former Wolfsburg sporting director Jörg Schmadtke later admitted it was a ""poor decision"" when Osimhen joined Napoli from Lille for over €60 million ($64.8 million).
It took him two years to settle down in the south of Italy. His father died during the COVID-19 lockdown, and he caught the virus when he attended the funeral. Osimhen has also battled severe injuries, including breaking his cheekbone and eye socket back in 2021, which is why he wears a protective mask to this day.
It was last season, his third in Naples, that Osimhen hit the peak of his powers to help crown Napoli Serie A champions for the first time since Diego Maradona led them to glory in 1987 and 1990, finishing as the league's top scorer with 26 goals.
""I think he was the most important element of that title challenge,"" Kristen Schlewitz, author of the book ""More Than Maradona,"" told DW. ""He has this graceful elegance that contradicts his reputation as a physical player.""
Only Maradona is more revered than Osimhen in the city of Naples. Like the Argentine legend, the young Nigerian's face adorns murals across the city, where they worship their football stars like gods. Fans stand in front of his home every night singing his name. They hang around restaurants until the early hours for autographs. Their adulation matches his boisterous spirit.
""For a boy from Olusosun, who would have thought I would have my picture beside Maradona's,"" said Osimhen. ""It's like a dream.""
But his relationship with the club was strained in September when Napoli's official TikTok account posted a video mocking the player after he missed a penalty against Bologna.
He deleted several photos of him wearing the club's shirt from his social media. His agent, Roberto Calenda, threatened to sue Napoli over the ""I am not a boy, I am coconut"" controversy after a second club Tiktok video mocked him with the viral song by the Swedish YouTube channel Coconut Hen.
Much of the tension has arisen because Osimhen has refused to extend his contract, which expires in 2025. Napoli have reportedly quoted sums upwards of €200 million ($216 million), scaring off potential buyers and including suitors from the Saudi Premier League in the summer. 
Despite his club success, Osimhen has yet to win a senior title with his country. He missed the last Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon through injury and failed to lead Nigeria to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, as they fell short in their final qualifying match against Ghana. Barring any late injuries, Nigeria coach Jose Peseiro expects the player, who scored ten goals in qualifying, to play a vital role in their Africa Cup of Nations challenge in Ivory Coast next month.
""Victor is a fantastic player and striker,"" Peseiro told DW. ""He is a player with the capacity to score and to create offensive-defensive pressure.""
Nigeria won their last AFCON title a decade ago in South Africa and are keen to return to the continental pinnacle. They have begun a social media campaign titled ""Let's do it again,"" inspired by a strong crop of talent that is now spearheaded by Africa's Player of the Year.

https://www.dw.com/en/referee-attack-stuns-turkey-super-lig-suspended-after-violence/a-67696442,SPORTS,Referee attack stuns Turkey: Super Lig suspended after violence 12.12.2023,"The Turkish Football Federation (TFF) has suspended the Super Lig after a referee was punched in the face by Ankaragucu's president Faruk Koca on Monday.
Koca entered the pitch and hit referee Halil Umut Meler when the final whistle blew after opponents Rizespor scored a 97th minute equalizer in the 1-1 draw at the Eryaman Stadium.
Koca's punch floored the referee, leaving him with a black eye.
Ankaragucu fans invaded the field after the game and Meler was kicked when he fell. It was, however, not clear who the attackers were.
The match official was able to get into the dressing room with the help of the police.
""This vile attack was not only made against Halil Umut Meler,"" the TFF said in a statement. ""Today, this inhumane and despicable attack was made against all stakeholders of Turkish football”
""The related club, the club chairman, club officials and all those guilty of attacking referee Umut Meler will be punished in the strongest terms possible,"" it added.
""By the decision of the Turkish Football Federation Board of Directors, matches in all leagues have been postponed indefinitely,"" the TFF said.
A detention order has been issued for Koca, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on social media platform X, formerly Twitter.
The minister added that two people have already been detained as part of a judicial probe into the incident.
On Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan denounced the attack on Meler.
""Sports means peace and brotherhood. Sport is incompatible with violence,"" Erdogan posted on X.
""We will never allow violence to take place in Turkish sports,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/are-women-football-players-getting-a-raw-deal/a-67683241,SOCCER,Are women football players getting a raw deal? 11.12.2023,"The scene has become rapidly less remarkable: 59,402 paying fans watching a women's football match. On this occasion, it's in London, a Women's Super League clash between Arsenal and Chelsea in mid-December. But it's happened and continues to occur in Australia, the USA and several European nations.
Such attendance is further proof of the surging growth in women's sport, driven by football above all else. A recent report by accounting firm Deloitte predicted that women's sports would cross the $1 billion (€928 million) global revenue threshold in 2024 for the first time, with football accounting for $555 million.
But such rapid growth has raised significant questions about its cost for the players union FIFPRO, who released their own report on the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand on the same day. It revealed that the players, whose impact on growing the game was evident on the pitch, in the stands and at the merchandising stalls, may be paying an unfair price.
The report surveyed 260 players from 26 of the 32 teams and found that one in three earns less than $30,000 a year from football (not including FIFA's World Cup bonus), and one in five needs a second job as a result.
Though the change is relatively recent, those on the pitch in London, and in the WSL in general, are fully professional. But that is only the case in a few leagues worldwide, and even then, players are well-paid at only the elite clubs. Even there, conditions are imperfect, with two-thirds of players admitting they felt short of their physical peak. Several of Arsenal's players made the last four of the World Cup in Australia and then faced a Champions League qualifier just over two weeks later.
Steph Catley was one of those. The fullback captained Australia in four matches as they fell at the semifinals and was back playing a competitive match in London, a 24-hour flight away, just 18 days after the third-place playoff. The recovery period was a day less for Arsenal's England internationals.
""Every break is very much welcomed at this stage,"" Catley told DW of the upcoming Christmas pause in the WSL. ""It is a lot of games, especially playing for Australia, where we do a lot of extra travel. That is something we're having to be careful of. That is something our medical and coaching staff do a really good job of managing. It's just important to know your body.""
Elite players like Catley at least don't have to balance second jobs or studies with their sporting careers and enjoy access to improved medical and fitness infrastructure, particularly at those clubs linked with major men's sides. But even for them, the effects of travel and match demands can quickly take a toll.
""If players don't have that secure period of at least three weeks, or ideally five weeks, after a long campaign before going into pre-season, then it's not only dangerous from the physical and physiological point of view but from a mental perspective as well,"" said FIFPRO's Chief Medical Officer Prof Dr. Vincent Gouttebarge.
That was not the case for Alessia Russo, Catley, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Caitlin Foord, and plenty of others in leagues around the world, who were back to playing high-profile matches, let alone training and traveling, so soon after the final in Sydney or third-place playoff in Brisbane. The introduction of a Nations League for women's football this year has further increased the number of matches squeezed into the calendar, and so too will upcoming changes to the UEFA Champions League.
Evidence of those demands was neatly present in this London derby. The scorer of Arsenal's first goal, Beth Mead, missed the World Cup with an anterior cruciate ligament injury that has become such a curse for the women's game while her teammate and England captain Leah Williamson has still not recovered from the same injury. Williamson's replacement as England skipper Millie Bright, missed the derby and the buildup to the World Cup after being the player who played the most minutes in the whole of Europe in the 2021-22 season.
""Our schedules are way more demanding now,"" she told DW earlier this year, before the World Cup. ""We're expected to do tournament after tournament after tournament while competing for every trophy when you play in those top-end clubs. It's impossible to keep going and we're not robots, our bodies are going to break down,"" she added, in prophetic fashion. 

The report did acknowledge the massive strides made at the top end of the women's game, with gender-equal conditions on accommodation, transport, and support staff negotiated for the World Cup and more money flowing into the game. But as Deloitte noted:
""This surge in fan and investor engagement is leading to new and improved opportunities for clubs and leagues, including greater commercial partnerships, increased participation and bigger matchdays. To ensure this growth remains consistent and sustainable, sports organizations must ensure that investment is directed to the right places, such as encouraging fan loyalty, player welfare, and maintaining competition across leagues.""
Women's football, at the very top level, is now at something of a crossroads: to grow in the way the men's game has, with money as its main driver or to go a little slower and look after those that made it interesting in the first place.

https://www.dw.com/en/omar-marmoush-egyptian-slays-bayern-ahead-of-salah-reunion/a-67679623,SPORTS,Omar Marmoush: Egyptian slays Bayern ahead of Salah reunion 09.12.2023,"Six years after moving to the Bundesliga, Omar Marmoush is cementing his reputation as one of the league's emerging talents.
The opening goal, and a pair of assists, in Eintracht Frankfurt's seismic 5-1 victory over Bayern Munich just before the Bundesliga's winter break will have caught the attention before a likely trip to the African Cup of Nations for the striker.
Marmoush moved to Germany from the Wadi Degla club, in his native Egypt, in 2017, finally making his Wolfsburg senior team debut three years later. Quick, mobile and with the ability to play across the front line, his performances drew admirers in Germany and abroad.
But much like another prolific African in the Bundesliga, Serhou Guirassy, Marmoush struggled to make a consistent impact, moving on loan to St Pauli and Stuttgart without quite delivering on his potential. But Frankfurt, who have forged a deserved reputation for talent spotting, had seen enough.
""In Omar Marmoush we have signed a player whose abilities will give our attack even greater flexibility,"" said Eintracht's board member for sport Markus Krösche when he signed the frontman on a free transfer ahead of the 2023-24 season. ""Omar has already proven his qualities in the Bundesliga, but at the same time he still has great potential to develop further.""
Krösche was quickly proved right, with six goals in Marmoush's first 10 Bundesliga games and four in five in the Europa Conference League. But a starring performance against Germany's perma-champions Bayern will elevate Marmoush's status to the next level.
""The goals that are coming for him at the moment are only a reward for the hard work he puts in for us,"" Marmoush's coach Dino Toppmöller said earlier in the season. ""Because of his speed, he always has moments that are uncomfortable for a defender when he makes that deep run. 
""But he now also has a feeling for getting into dangerous areas again and again and helping us with his footballing technique,"" he added.
Frankfurt will likely have to do without that dangerous combination of work rate and technique soon, with Marmoush likely to be named in the Egypt squad for the Africa Cup of Nations in January.
The 24-year-old started Egypt's defeat on penalties to Senegal in last year's final and forms part of a frontline that revolves around Liverpool star Mohamed Salah. The pair have been in touch since before Marmoush found his feet in Germany.
""We're in touch. The contact between the Egyptian players in Europe is very good,"" Marmoush told the St. Pauli website when he was on loan there in 2021. ""We try to support each other because we know it isn't easy to make the transition to Europe.""
It may not be easy, but Marmoush is increasingly making it look so. He's not got a bad role model to follow.

The athletes will only be allowed to participate in the event as neutrals. They cannot display any flags, emblems or anthems during their participation. 
""The Executive Board (EB) of the IOC has decided that Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) who have qualified through the existing qualification systems of the International Federations (IFs) on the field of play will be declared eligible to compete at the Olympic Games Paris 2024,"" the Olympic body said in a statement.
The IOC initially banned Russia — and its ally Belarus — from international sports events after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Over the past year, a number of Olympic sports have eased restrictions, allowing Russians and Belarusians to return as neutral athletes in individual events and under strict conditions.
Athletes from the two countries will now be allowed to compete in individual sporting events in Paris 2024, but no teams will be allowed.
""Athletes who actively support the war"" as well as ""athletes who are contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies"" will be prohibited from competing at the Olympics, the IOC said.
""Only a very limited number of athletes will qualify through the existing qualification systems of the (governing bodies),"" the IOC said.
So far, eight Russians and three Belarusians have qualified for the Olympics in Paris. More than 60 Ukrainians are among the approximately 4,600 athletes already eligible to take part.
Russia's Sports Minister Oleg Matytsin called the conditions ""discriminatory.""
""They are damaging the Olympic Games themselves, and not Russian sports. The approach is absolutely unacceptable,"" he said. 
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba condemned what he said was a ""shameful"" IOC decision.
""The IOC essentially gave Russia the green light to weaponize the Olympics. Because the Kremlin will use every Russian and Belarusian athlete as a weapon in its propaganda warfare,"" Kubla wrote on X, formerly Twitter. 
Athletes and officials from Ukraine, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have repeatedly urged the IOC to expel Russia and Belarus from the Olympics entirely.

Earlier this year, Thomas Bach, the IOC president, said he understood the call but added it contradicted the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the Olympic Charter.
""This puts us in a dilemma. If we set a precedent, it will destroy Olympic sport. We're talking about international competitions, which can then become a political pawn,"" Bach said.
The IOC did, however, suspend the Russian Olympic Committee after it ""unilaterally"" decided to recognize regional sports organizations in four annexed Ukrainian territories as members in October. 
The four regional organizations, namely in Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia, represent partially occupied and illegally annexed Ukrainian regions which, according to the IOC, fall ""under the authority of the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine.""
The step, taken by the ROC on October 5, therefore, ""constitutes a breach of the Olympic Charter because it violates the territorial integrity"" of the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
The Russian Olympic Committee has appealed that decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

https://www.dw.com/en/turkeys-erdogan-vows-new-era-in-ties-with-greece/a-67655942,POLITICS,Turkey's Erdogan vows 'new era' in ties with Greece 07.12.2023,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday made his first official visit to Athens since 2017, telling his Greek counterpart that he believes that ""a new era"" is dawning in relations between their two countries.
Greece and Turkey have long been regional rivals, but ties have recently become closer after Greece sent rescuers and aid to Turkey following a February earthquake that killed at least 50,000 people there.
Erdogan and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis signed a declaration on ""Friendly Relations and Good Neighbourliness"" in Athens.
""There is no issue between us that is unsolvable. So long as we focus on the big picture and don't end up being like those who cross the sea and drown in the river,"" Erdogan said after a longer than scheduled meeting with Mitsotakis.
""We want to turn the Aegean into a sea of peace. Through the joint steps we will take as Turkey and Greece, we want to be an example to the world,"" he added.
Mitsotakis said while relations had been ""dangerously threatened"" in past years it was now on a  ""calmer path.""
""Geography and history has dictated that we live in the same neighborhood ... But I feel a historical responsibility to utilise this opportunity to bring the two states side-by-side, just as our borders are,"" Mitsotakis said.
The two leaders signed more than a dozen deals including ones on energy, education, agriculture, sports, technology and tourism. 
Erdogan also met Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou in televised comments that he believed that ""the Turkey-Greece strategic cooperation meeting will lead to a new era"" in relations, adding that ""we need to be optimistic, and this optimism will be fruitful in the future.""
The Turkish president said, ""We will discuss what steps going forward we can take on all issues after preparations have been made by the relevant ministers. We will proceed in a more logical way.""   
""I believe it is best for the future of both sides to discuss looking at the glass half-full,"" Erdogan said.
Erdogan said he aimed to nearly double bilateral trade volume to $10 billion (€9.3 billion) from $5.5 billion currently.
Sakellaropoulou, whose role is largely ceremonial, said the natural disasters that hit both countries this year — wildfires and floods in Greece and the earthquake in Turkey — had brought the two closer together.  
She said it is now ""perhaps more necessary than ever for Greece and Turkey to work together to enhance prosperity, to preserve peace, stability and respect for international law, and to promote good neighborly relations for the benefit of both our peoples and the wider region.""
Ankara and Athens have long had territorial disputes and rows over expoitation rights in the Aegean Sea and eastern Mediterranean, with Erdogan last year accusing Greece of ""occupying"" Aegean islands and threatening to use force in return.
The disputes have led the two countries to the brink of war three times in the last 50 years.
Migration has also been a thorny issue, as many people fleeing conflict in the Middle East and elsewhere use Turkey as a point of departure for Europe via the Mediterranean, with Greece a frequent gateway to the EU.
A 2016 deal with the EU aimed to curb the number of people making the attempt, and one agreement to be signed in Athens during Erdogan's five-hour visit also focuses on migration, aiming to establish better communication between the coast guards of the two countries.
Greece is expected to put its weight behind Ankara's longstanding request to ease travel restrictions for Turkish nationals in the European Union.

https://www.dw.com/en/nigeria-legend-jay-jay-okocha-bundesliga-can-grow-in-africa/a-67638012,SOCCER,Nigeria legend Jay-Jay Okocha: Bundesliga can grow in Africa 05.12.2023,"The Bundesliga needs to do more to win hearts and achieve growth in the African market, according to former Nigeria midfielder Austin ""Jay-Jay"" Okocha.
""People didn't know how good the Bundesliga is because they failed for decades to market the Bundesliga [to Africa],"" Okocha, who serves as an ambassador for Germany's top division, told DW during a media roundtable over the weekend.
This year marked 30 years since Okocha scored his famous goal of the season for Eintracht Frankfurt against Karlsruhe and their legendary goalkeeper, Oliver Kahn.

""I am delighted now that they have realized they must reach out because that is what the Premier League did.
""When it comes to entertainment and good football, the [Bundesliga] is up there. Because people didn't get to watch the Bundesliga week in and week out before, they didn't understand how good the Bundesliga is. But I'm really delighted now and happy to be part of reaching out to the market.""
Okocha is part of a Bundesliga visit to Johannesburg this week, where the league will celebrate its 60th anniversary with events including match screenings. But the Bundesliga has yet to open an African office.
According to the DFL, 22 African players currently play in the Bundesliga, and 53 others have connections to the continent through at least one of their parents. African players have been thriving in the Bundesliga since Ghana's Ibrahim Sunday made a 45-minute appearance for Werder Bremem in 1976.  
But a visit by DW to some Bundesliga clubs last weekend showed that many still have not committed to the African market.
Former Bundesliga champion Borussia Mönchengladbach has had many African players in its 123-year history. The club has set up academies in China and Singapore. Still, its sole outreach to Africa was the donation of the team's shirts to a children's club during a Bundesliga event in Nigeria. 
""Right now, we are talking about touch points for different countries, and we are talking to several potential partners in Africa, but it has not come to the point that we can cooperate with them,"" Denise Pörtner, manager of global partnerships at Gladbach, told DW.
""The continent of Africa is a target for the Bundesliga, so it shows that it is really important for German football, and so we are thinking of how we can find a touch point for Africa,"" she said.
Current Bundesliga leader Bayer Leverkusen has five African players in their first team. Yet they don't have any academies in an African country.
""The business of sport is also finding good players,"" Simon Rolfes, the club's sporting director, told DW. ""We are looking at the African market and players playing in Europe. We have a good scouting department, and they are checking the market, and I think Africa will become more and more important for this.""
In April, Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich signed a five-year partnership with tourism group Visit Rwanda. Despite criticism in Germany, it showed opportunities in the African market beyond sporting talent.
""The African continent offers fantastic opportunities and, with the right strategy, many prospects and possibilities for Bundesliga clubs, regardless of the many talents that come from Africa,"" Sebastian Schächter, of sports consultancy Schächter Sports, told DW.
""However, building up the market environment and sufficient business opportunities in Africa requires time and perseverance for clubs. The return on investment is much faster in Asia or North America.""
Schächter has represented third-division side DSC Arminia Bielefeld in its partnership with South African second-tier club, Maritzburg United. This relationship was built on the back of former South African national team players Delroy Buckley and Sibusiso Zuma, who once played for Bielefeld.
""With a long-term youth training program in Johannesburg, coach training measures, many CSR (corporate social responsibility) measures and cooperation with the Chamber of Foreign Trade of Southern Africa and Maritzburg United, DSC Arminia has succeeded in generating a sustainable and credible impact that has had an extremely positive effect on the brand and now offers great opportunities,"" said Schächter.
Okocha, and many in Africa, are waiting for Bundesliga clubs to follow suit.

https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-students-fare-worse-than-ever-in-pisa-school-tests/a-67638952,EDUCATION,Germany's students fare worse than ever in PISA school tests 05.12.2023,"German pupils have performed worse than ever in a key international survey which found that standards of school education have slipped globally – with the exception of Asia.
In the first Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) report commissioned by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) since the COVID-19 pandemic, international average performance among 15-year-olds in reading and mathematics slumped dramatically.
Published on Tuesday, the report surveyed 81 countries and found that the average international math score fell by the equivalent of three-quarters of a year of learning, while reading scores fell by the equivalent of half a year, meaning that students struggle to perform basic arithmetic or interpret simple texts.
The setbacks spanned nations rich and poor, big and small, with few making progress, but the results in Germany were particularly concerning, with students in Germany recording their lowest scores ever and joining their Polish, Norwegian, Dutch and Icelandic counterparts in suffering a 25-point drop or more.
In math, German pupils achieved a score of 475, compared to 500 in the previous study published in 2019. In reading, they scored 480, down from 498 three years ago, and science was down to 492 from 503.
The results recall those of the first PISA study in 2000, which placed Germany, Europe's biggest economy, below the OECD average and also revealed worrying correlations between social background and educational opportunities.
On the social ramifications brought to light by the results, PISA director Doris Lewalter, an education researcher at the Technical University of Munich and chair of the Board of the Center for International Comparative Studies in Education, highlighted a lack of linguistic support among certain demographics.
""If we have pupils from immigrant backgrounds, we cannot assume that they have already mastered the German language of education when they come to Germany,"" she said.
This time around, Germany still remains close to the OECD average in math and literacy and just above average in science, but standards have dropped dramatically across the globe.
""Compared to 2018, mean performance fell by 10 score points in reading and by almost 15 score points in mathematics, which is equivalent to three-quarters of a year's worth of learning,"" the report concluded, adding: ""The decline in mathematics performance is three times greater than any previous consecutive change.""
""The PISA 2022 results show a fall in student performance that is unprecedented in PISA's history,"" OECD education analyst Irene Hu told reporters.
The PISA study is usually carried out every three years, the current edition, however, was put back a year due to the pandemic. While the OECD said the disruption of the pandemic was a factor in the global setbacks, it has cautioned against blaming everything on COVID-19.
It found that the link between school closures and academic setbacks was ""not so direct"" and pointed out that some countries were already trending downward in math, including Belgium, Finland, Canada and France.
A survey of students found about half faced closures of more than three months, but it didn't always lead to lower scores. There was ""no clear difference"" in performance trends between countries that had limited closures, including Iceland and Sweden, and those with longer closures, such as Brazil and Ireland.
""Many other factors impacted learning during this period, such as the quality of remote teaching and levels of support granted to struggling students,"" it said.
Bucking the trend once again were Asian countries, which dominated the top spots.
Singapore led the way, the island city-state scoring high in all three areas: mathematics, reading and science.
""These results suggest that, on average, Singaporean students are the equivalent of almost three to five years of schooling ahead of their peers,"" the report said, listing Macao, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea closely behind.
However, academic success doesn't necessarily translate into happiness, which has also been examined by the OECD for the first time using nine aspects of students' lives to measure well-being.
The report found that students in Singapore, Macao and Taiwan who performed best in math often reported ""a high fear of failure and limited engagement in extracurricular activities such as sports.""
In contrast, students in countries with lower average PISA test scores, such as Spain and Peru, were found to have ""lower levels of anxiety"" and placed ""greater focus on sports.""

https://www.dw.com/en/leverkuen-afcon/a-67621517,SOCCER,Bayer Leverkusen's AFCON headache risks wider fallout 04.12.2023,"Bayer Leverkusen striker Victor Boniface fondly remembers when Nigeria won their third and last Africa Cup of Nations title a decade ago. He is set to play his first tournament with Nigeria in January — even if it robs his German Bundesliga club of their main forward for a month of football games.
""It is the dream of every football player from Nigeria to represent their country and win a trophy for the country. So we're looking forward to the next AFCON,"" Boniface told DW after he scored his eighth Bundesliga goal in a 1-1 draw with Borussia Dortmund at the BayArena in Leverkusen.
The 22-year-old is one of five Leverkusen players, including Odilon Kossounou, Edmond Tapsoba, Amine Adli and Nathan Tella, who could head to the 2023 AFCON in the Ivory Coast in January.
The 2023 tournament was originally scheduled for June and July this year, but it was moved back because of fears the rainy season in the Ivory Coast could stop play. 
The absence of Boniface, who was voted Rookie of the Month for the first three months of the Bundesliga season, will hit Leverkusen hard as Xabi Alonso's side could win the Bundesliga title for the first time.
But Burkina Faso defender Tapsoba thinks the club will manage without their African contingent.
""For me as a footballer from Africa, the African Cup is a special competition,"" Tapsoba told DW.
""And even though we're leaving in January, we trust our teammates. Everybody is working hard, and you can see that the coach is trying to mix the lineup in every game. Everybody is ready to take their chance, so we're not so worried about it.""
Burkina Faso lost their only final against Nigeria, in 2013, by a narrow 1-0 scoreline. So, winning the AFCON is a big ambition for Tapsoba.
""For our generation, it is challenging because it is full of young talents. We are trying to do better than our [predecessors]. We are going to Ivory Coast to do better than the last time,"" he said.
Two trophies are proudly displayed in the foyer of the BayArena: a UEFA Europa League title won in 1988 under the tournament's old name of the UEFA Cup, and a German Cup (DFB Pokal) won in 1993. Leverkusen have gone 30 years without a title. 
The club's infamous string of second-place finishes in the 2001/02 season — in the Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup — earned the club the nickname ""Neverkusen.""
Club CEO Fernando Carro, desperate for a trophy, told German media it was ""unacceptable” that the AFCON was taking place in January.
But sporting director Simon Rolfes hopes that they will be able to deal with the situation.
""The thing with the African Cup is for sure it is not ideal, but we would love to have the African Cup in [the European] summer, at the summer break between the seasons,"" Rolfes told DW.
""I know that the players are proud to play for their country; I know that from my playing time, it was the same. And we are happy and proud that we have so many national team players representing their countries.
""We have to deal with this. We have a really good squad, and I think we can handle this situation, but it is not ideal. But in life, there are some situations where you have to deal with this, and we will do.""
The AFCON could lead to a change in where top Bundesliga clubs look to recruit players in the future. Champions Bayern Munich have three African players, although only Morocco defender Noussair Mazraoui is likely to leave for the AFCON.
High-flying VFB Stuttgart will lose top strikers Serhou Guirassy to Guinea and Silas Katompa Mvumpa to the DR Congo for the tournament.
But Leverkusen will be the worst hit. Rolfes bemoaned the fact that moving the AFCON to European summer — as happened in 2019 in Egypt — is not being repeated.
""You cannot have 15 African players in your squad, and then in January, you do not have any players anymore,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/as-economy-tanks-turkish-companies-eye-egypt/a-67606182,BUSINESS,"As economy tanks, Turkish companies eye Egypt 02.12.2023","Relations between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, have been icy for years.
When democratically elected Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi was removed from office by then General Abdel Fattah el-Sissi in 2013, Erdogan immediately sided with the jailed Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated leader, calling el-Sissi a putschist, murderer and tyrant.
Erdogan adopted the Muslim Brotherhood's signature hand gesture and often dismissively referred to Turkish opposition politicians as el-Sissis in an expression of loathing for the new Egyptian president.
Egypt, in turn, accused Turkey of supporting the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood and granting safe haven to its members.
The countries supported opposing sides in the Libya conflict.
Egypt and Turkey were also in disagreement over the extraction of gas in the Mediterranean Sea.
But, despite these differences, a thaw in Egyptian-Turkish ties is now happening as the world endures multiple crises and both countries' economies continue to struggle.
A year ago, Egyptian and Turkish business delegations met for the first time in nine years. Since then, ties have been growing ever stronger.
Turkish companies have been unhappy with the state of the Turkish economy for years, as President Erdogan's low interest rate policies have continued to drive up inflation, which is officially 61.5% right now. High fuel costs and uncertainty over central bank interest rate policies have compounded the problem.
Turkey's new finance minister, Mehmet Simsek; and the new head of the Central Bank of the Turkish Republic, Hafize Gaye Erkan, have also been unable to create stability — despite initiating a return to conventional economic policy. Both say the Turkish economy will regain stability and return to single-digit inflation rates in 2025 or 2026. Many companies, however, are unwilling to put up with such uncertainty.

Turkish companies face growing production costs, high fuel prices, and unpredictable foreign exchange and interest rate policies. Quite a few are therefore thinking about relocating abroad.
Egypt, for example, offers far lower labor and production costs than Turkey. What's more, in April, Egypt removed the need for Turkish citizens to acquire a visa before entering the country.
So far, Turkish investments in Egypt this year have totaled $2.5 billion (€2.2 billion). It is estimated they could grow to $3 billion (€2.7 billion) by the end of 2023.
Turkish companies operating in Egypt also have the opportunity to engage in tariff-free trade with third-party countries, allowing them to tap into new markets.
""Egypt was already an attractive country for doing business, but lifting the visa requirement for Turkish citizens marked a real turning point,"" the chairman of the Turkish-Egyptian Business Council, Mustafa Denizer, told DW. Turkish companies had been looking to move to other countries for many years in a bid to remain competitive, said Denizer, adding, ""With the [Egyptian] visa-free regime in place, there is now great momentum [for them to move there].""
Today, 35 Turkish industrial enterprises are operating out of Egypt and generating an annual turnover of more than $1.5 billion (€1.3 billion), the expert said.
Turkish companies based in Egypt could tap into a range of different markets, thanks to free-trade deals with US, EU, South America and some African countries, according to Denizer.
In Turkey, average monthly labor costs are around $500 (€459) per worker — in Egypt, labor costs are a pittance of that at a mere $150 (€137). Fuel costs are also far lower in Egypt. That is why major Turkish companies like Arcelik, Sisecam, Temsa and Yildiz Holding have already moved production there.
Temsa, for example, makes buses and vans in Egypt and exports them to the rest of the world, according to the company. Yildiz Holding's local confectionery brand Pladis is enjoying great success on the Egyptian market, the second largest in the Middle East/North Africa (MENA) region. Yesim Textil, in turn, operates apparel factories in Cairo, Alexandria and Ismailia, supplying its goods to many world-famous sports brands. Electrical giant Arcelik, known in Europe for its Beko brand, recently invested $100 million (€91 million) in a new Egyptian factory slated to begin operating by the end of the year. Iskefe Holding, LC Waikiki, Eroglu Group and many others have also announced additional investments.
Some 70,000 people in Egypt already work for Turkish companies, not counting those employed by suppliers. A third of all textiles and clothes in Egypt are now produced in Turkish factories.
Denizer, who works in the textile industry, says Turkish companies are receiving a warm welcome in Egypt. ""Our companies are very well received and looked after there.""
Turkish companies do, however, face a foreign currency shortage in Egypt. This shortage of dollars means Turkish companies producing goods for Egypt's domestic market often receive delayed payments. The Turkish and Egyptian central banks are currently negotiating a resolution to the problem, Denizer told DW.
In October, Turkish Minister of Trade Ömer Polat and a business delegation traveled to Egypt. Ibrahim Burkay, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in the economically potent city of Bursa, accompanied him.
""Our goal is to increase Egyptian-Turkish trade volume to $15 billion (€13.7 billion) in the next five years,"" Burkay said. Last year, it totaled $7 billion (€6.4 billion).
Bursa companies are focusing on two sectors in particular: the automotive and textile industries, according to Burkay. ""We also have the opportunity to cooperate with Egyptian companies in other countries,"" he added. Burkay said he sees great potential in Egyptian trade fairs, too. ""We can benefit from many years of experience in this field,"" said Burkay, adding that plans for a large textiles and fabric trade fair were already in the works.

https://www.dw.com/en/under-17-world-cup-light-in-german-football-darkness/a-67594994,SOCCER,Under-17 World Cup: Light in German football darkness? 30.11.2023,"""I told the boys they'd make themselves immortal!"" head coach Christian Wück told Sky immediately after Germany's U17 side clinched World Cup glory. ""We are Europe and world champions! I'm so grateful to be able to coach this age group. And today was our last game together. Words fail me. It's just an incredible feeling of happiness.""
Germany were forced to show a lot of resolve as they clinched a nervy penalty shootout win over France, after being pegged back in the final against their European counterparts having taken a 2-0 lead after 51 minutes.
When Winners Mark Osawe's was given a second yellow card on 69 minutes and Mathis Amougou’s then equalized for the French five minutes from time, it looked like a disappointing end was on the cards.
But, a second successive penalty shootout ended once again in victory for Germany and jubilation for Wück.
""If anyone got to know the character of the team, it was in this game today,"" he added. ""To fight against such opposition, to be behind again in the penalty shoot-out, to always believe in yourself. That's incredible and so everything is perfect. We are absolutely delighted.""
That Wück's team have reached this point is not a huge surprise. They had already secured the U17 European Championship title in June, winning the final, also against France, on penalties.
In view of the current crisis among Germany's front-line men's and women's senior teams, the youth team's success is a welcome change. The men's and women's national team and the U21 men's team have disappointed across the board recently, with both the men in 2022 and the women in 2023 exiting their respective World Cups at the group stages.
Though only recently appointed as men's coach, Julian Nagelsmann has already come under heavy criticism after recent friendly defeats against Turkey and Austria. The headlines from a long list of shortcomings were along the lines of no plan, no identity, too many tactical instructions for the players to take on board. A home Euros in 2024 means the pressure will not relent.
Now the focus is shifting to the U17 players instead, particularly those who fit the hero narrative. Goalkeeper Konstantin Heide, for example, only played in the semifinal against Argentina because regular keeper Max Schmitt was ill.
Heide impressed made a number of strong saves during the game and then saved two penalties before pulling off the heroics again in the win over France, saving the decisive 12th spot kick to make Germany World Cup champions.
Paris Brunner, who scored two goals against Argentina and opening the scoring against France, is also in the spotlight — but not just because of his goals. The 17-year-old, who won the Fritz Walter Medal for outstanding sporting achievements this year, was suspended by his club Borussia Dortmund in October ""for disciplinary reasons,"" and apparently not for the first time.
However, it remains unclear exactly what happened as the club and player have been silent on the matter. In the end, Brunner was pardoned and is now seemingly back on track.
For Wück, players like Brunner and Heide are representative of the fact that Germany — contrary to what is often claimed — does not have a problem developing young players. Talented youngsters are available, but are short of first-team opportunities.
""We have to trust more in German talent again,"" said Wück, who spoke from experience. He made his first Bundesliga appearance for Nuremberg in 1990, and was the third youngest Bundesliga player in history at the age of 17 years and 133 days.
Wück's players, all born in 2006, are now the same age he was back then. He hopes his proteges will continue their development and get their chance at club level. Perhaps the impression made in this tournament will help them make it to the very top.
However, they are far from the first successful youth team in the history of German football. Despite that, only a handful of players who have won an international title with a German men's youth team have gone on to have a great career in the senior national team, let alone win titles with the seniors. The glorious exception was 2009, when the U17s won a maiden European Championship title and then the U21s also became European champions.
In addition to goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, two future world champions — Shkodran Mustafi and Mario Götze — played in the U17s. The U21s, meanwhile, included five players — Manuel Neuer, Benedikt Höwedes, Mats Hummels, Sami Khedira and Mesut Özil — who won the 2014 World Cup title in Brazil alongside Mustafi and Götze. However, there were also many players among those squads who never won a senior international cap.
Furthermore, the U21s of 2009 can't really be compared with the current U17s. Once players reach the U21 setup, they often play in the senior squad of top division clubs. In 2009, for example, Manuel Neuer had already been No. 1 at Schalke for several years, and the other future world champions were also Bundesliga regulars when they won the Euros.
For the current crop, the path to the Bundesliga and the senior Germany team is still long and winding, even if they all play in the youth teams of German clubs in the top two divisions. The only exceptions are goalkeeper Konstantin Heide from SpVgg Unterhaching (third division) and captain Noah Darvich, who moved from SC Freiburg's youth setup to Barcelona's academy in August.
Some of them will likely develop into good Bundesliga professionals. Perhaps one or two of them will even make it into the senior national team. But they may also end up like the majority of their predecessors from 1985, the last time a German U17 team reached a World Cup final.
That team lost the final 2-0 to Nigeria and of the 13 players who played, only three — Marcel Witeczek (410 Bundesliga games), Martin Schneider (379) and Detlev Dammeier (248) — made a lasting impression in Germany's top flight, and none of them played for Germany's senior team.

https://www.dw.com/en/is-crickets-transgender-ban-fair/a-67532640,SPORTS,Is cricket's transgender ban fair? 29.11.2023,"The International Cricket Council (ICC) recently made changes to its gender eligibility regulations for international cricket, effectively banning transgender women. The decision follows similar rulings by governing bodies in swimming, rugby league, cycling and athletics.
This was seemingly sparked by the presence of trans woman Danielle McGahey, who played six T20 internationals for Canada, scoring 118 runs.
Loughborough University researcher, author and athlete Joanna Harper believes the ICC ""got scared and overreacted"" and that its decision makes its perspective clear.
""I believe that trans women are a subcategory of all women, but there are others who think that trans women are really men invading women's sports, and if you believe that, then each successful trans woman becomes an affront,"" Harper tells DW.
""There's little doubt that the majority of the people making this decision do not view trans women as a subcategory of all women and I think that's really unfortunate.""
Harper says the physiological differences between trans women and cis women should be considered in sport and that if those differences were such that trans women were dominating, then something should be done about it. However, for that to become the case, trans women would have to be involved first.
""Any human being who goes through a testosterone fueled, masculinising puberty gains a very substantial advantages over anyone who doesn't. There are lots of papers on that,"" Harper says.
""What isn't well established at all is how many of those advantages are taken away when someone medically transitions from being a male athlete to being a female athlete. And so when people say they use the science, that's what they mean. They're just assuming that trans women perform like men. And trans women don't perform athletically like men. So they're using science, but the wrong science.""
An ICC spokesperson told DW that ""the ICC is not assuming that trans women perform athletically like men. Instead, the principles approved are what the ICC considers are necessary to protect the integrity of the women's game and address the concerns over safety and fairness.""
Fast bowling is likely one of those safety concerns. It is worth noting that the top bowling speeds in the women's game peak at about 130 kilometers per hour. To consistently bowl faster than that is an elite skill for any cis man. Only a small number of professional cricketers can do so, and the chances that inside the small population of transgender people — roughly one percent of the world population is transgender — who have gone through gender-affirming treatment could consistently bowl faster appear miniscule. Given trans women are underrepresented in cricket — McGahey is the only one on record in the history of the international game — there also isn't enough data currently to provide clarity.

Individual countries are allowed their own domestic policies, but Harper believes the rulings will still have a trickle-down effect on the grassroots game. A trans woman playing domestic cricket in England, who asked to stay anonymous over concerns of a backlash regarding her comments, confirmed as much to DW.
""Cricket is a team sport and has largely felt safe and inclusive to me, but when these kinds of decisions are made to exclude a certain group of people, everything feels unsure and unwelcoming. Cricket has always been my escape but it doesn't feel that way today,"" she said.
""It's also noticeable to me, on social media but also within cricket circles, that once the announcement was made, other people — who, in my opinion, are bigoted — felt more empowered to vocalize how they really feel about transgender females. It is so often that tired trope of, 'I do not mean you, but just imagine how much our sport and women's sport will be destroyed if transgender players are allowed to take over every women's team.'
""I am used to being abused for who I am, but it is devastating that the governing body overseeing the sport I love has helped to open up a whole area of abuse from people who previously were not so vocal — just through a ruling they made.""
Both the player and Harper questioned whether the ICC had adequately consulted the transgender community, though an ICC spokesperson confirmed to DW that the organization had indeed contacted members of that community.
After the news, McGahey posted on Instagram saying that although her career was over, she would not stop fighting for transgender inclusion in women's sport.
Harper believes McGahey's decision to fight this will likely mean a visit to the Court of Arbitration (CAS) for sport.
""It is my belief that we are already going to see a couple of cases in 2024 of trans women before CAS in different sports,"" Harper tells DW.
""The court has made it very, very clear that if you are excluding, then the burden of proof falls on the organization,"" Harper, who was part of the Caster Semenya case with World Athletics, explains.
""The cases haven't happened yet, but I think they will, and it is difficult to imagine that the governing bodies can meet this [burden of proof]. They will certainly try to, using the overwhelming evidence to suggest that men don't belong in women's sports, which, absolutely, I accept.
""But trans women don't perform athletically like men. And so then where do the sport's governing bodies go?""
In two years, the regulations will be reviewed. An ICC spokesperson confirmed to DW that when that review process occurs, ""consideration will be given to whether there is another option that could be taken going forward which assesses (in a fair, equitable and valid way) an individual participant's compatibility with the women's game.""

https://www.dw.com/en/south-africa-oscar-pistorius-granted-parole-after-murder/a-67540116,CRIME,South Africa: Oscar Pistorius granted parole after murder 24.11.2023,"South African Paralympic champion Oscar Pistorius was granted an early release from prison Friday, a decade after he killed his girlfriend.
A parole board at a correctional center outside Pretoria where he is currently being held approved his release from January 5, 2024.
""The Department of Correctional Services (DCS) confirms parole placement for Mr Oscar Leonard Carl Pistorius, effectively from 5 January 2024,"" a DCS spokesman said.
Known as the ""Blade Runner"" for his carbon-fiber prosthetic legs, Pistorius went from a public hero to a convicted killer in a 2014 trial that caught the world's attention.
Pistorius killed Reeva Steenkamp, a professional model, in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, firing four times through the bathroom door of his ultra-secure Pretoria house.
The athlete had pleaded not guilty and denied killing Steenkamp in a rage, saying he mistook her for a dangerous intruder, hiding in the bathroom in the middle of the night.
Prosecutors argued that Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model and reality TV star, had fled to the toilet cubicle during a late-night argument and Pistorius killed her in a rage.
He was initially jailed for five years for culpable homicide, a charge comparable to manslaughter.
But in late 2015, the Supreme Court of Appeal found him guilty of murder and he returned to jail for six years.
A year later, the Supreme Court more than doubled his sentence to 13 years and five months, saying his original jail term was ""shockingly lenient"".
The mother of Steenkamp told the parole board in a written victim impact statement that the Paralympic champion has ""not been rehabilitated.""
""Rehabilitation requires someone to engage honestly, with the full truth of his crime and the consequences thereof. Nobody can claim to have remorse if they're not able to engage fully with the truth,"" June Steenkamp wrote in her statement.
But the statement, read by a family friend outside the prison on Friday, said she would not oppose his parole.
""I simply cannot muster the energy to face him again at this stage."" Nevertheless, ""I do not believe Oscar's version that he thought the
person in the toilet was a burglar ... In fact, I do not know anybody who does. My dearest child screamed for her life. ... I believe he knew it was Reeva.""
Pistorius met Steenkamp's parents last year as part of his rehabilitation.
Serious offenders in South Africa must serve at least half their sentence to be eligible for parole.
Friday's hearing was Pistorius' second attempt at parole in less than eight months. 
He lost a first bid in March when the board found he had not completed the minimum detention period required to be let out.
But the Constitutional Court last month ruled that was a mistake, paving the way for a new hearing.
His lawyers said they hoped the ex-athlete would be granted ""an immediate release."" However, the process often takes weeks and usually comes with conditions.
Months before the killing, Pistorius had become the first double amputee to compete at the Olympics and a multiple Paralympic sprinting champion.
Having overcome the amputation of both his legs below the knee as a baby to run on specially designed carbon-fiber blades, his sporting prowess was easily marketable.
The killing saw sponsors cut ties and mounting legal bills forced him to sell his properties.
The high-profile murder trial exposed his darker side: with the prosecution portraying him as a dangerously volatile man with a love of guns, women and fast cars.
In 2009, he allegedly assaulted a 19-year-old woman at a party in a case that was settled out of court.
Two years later, he was accused of firing a gun through the sunroof of an ex-girlfriend's moving car.
Weeks before he shot Steenkamp, he fired a gun by accident at a restaurant in Johannesburg.
He also kept a pistol under his bed at his high-security home for fear of being robbed.

https://www.dw.com/en/marie-louise-eta-bundesliga-coaching-pioneer/a-67482129,SOCCER,Marie-Louise Eta: Bundesliga coaching pioneer 24.11.2023,"Union Berlin may be in the relegation zone, and still searching for their first win since August — but on November 25 the club did at least pick up a point while also making football history in the men's Bundesliga .
When Augsburg visited the German capital for that 1-1 draw, a woman was among a men’s Bundesliga team's coaching staff for the very first time. Marie-Louise Eta was named as the assistant to Marco Grote, with both promoted from Union's U19 team to take the reins of the seniors on an interim basis.
Though Grote has returned to his old job after Union hired Nenad Bjelica as head coach, Eta will be on the bench for Union's Champions League match against Braga on Wednesday before she returns, meaning she will also make history in that competition.
Eta, who was born in Dresden in 1991, hung up her boots at 26 to become a coach, initially working at the German Football Association (DFB), managing various age groups of Germany's international women's teams before making the switch to coach the men at Union.
Having just made the emotionally charged decision to fire Urs Fischer, the coach who brought Union into the Bundesliga for the first time in their history and then remarkably guided them into the Champions League, Union's president Dirk Zingler said he has simply chosen the best person for the job.
""It's not a conscious decision to have a woman as assistant coach, that would discredit the decision,"" Zingler said after Grote and Eta were appointed. ""We have made a decision for a soccer coach who already works in the team.""
Beyond Eta, there aren’t many women who can say they’ve coached both men and women professionally. One of the select few is Imke Wübbenhorst, who is currently head coach of Young Boys’ women’s team in Switzerland. She was also Eta's former teammate at BV Cloppenburg for two seasons, before taking charge of the men’s team for a spell.
The pair played a season together in the second tier and another season in the Women’s Bundesliga after winning promotion. In an interview with DW, Wübbenhorst explained how the pair would discuss football strategy and even implement tactical changes on the field during games.
""We were very similar because I always wanted to be a coach,"" Wübbenhorst said. ""We could speak on a higher level about systems, how to press... sometimes we would stand on the pitch and say 'Ok, how can we solve this problem?' So we would change something on the pitch.""
Wübbenhorst said her former teammate’s serenity and intelligence is what sets her apart, and believes her new role as assistant coach at Union perfectly matches her skills.
""Marie-Louise is a very calm person and a very intelligent player. She always used to play in a central position, as a 6 or an 8. She has good strategy, she knows where to bring the ball, how to create space for others. And she can handle different types of people,"" she said. ""I think she likes to work in the background.""
Eta has attracted attention not only for her coaching ability but for her gender.
While Grote said Eta was ""quickly accepted"" by Union's U19 players when she arrived at the club earlier this year, Eta has previously faced resistance as a female coach of male players.
""I noticed that some people treated me differently compared with before,"" she told UEFA last month. ""It is something you notice and that is not always comfortable.
""I've always tried not to put the focus on the fact that I am a woman,"" Eta added. ""For me, it's not about women and men, or whether a man is good for a women's team, it's always about diversity.""
Wübbenhorst, who rose to prominence in Germany in 2018 when she was appointed head coach of the men's team at Cloppenburg, sees it the same way. She says most of the challenges coaches face are experienced by men and women. But some are unique to women.

""You have to convince them with good drills, good analysis,"" said Wübbenhorst. ""Wherever you are, you have to show that you have good qualities and you have to develop the players.""
""They are used to good coaches, up from the youth level, so they can compare more easily. When you are a female coach, they are not impressed with your career from the beginning. You have to impress them. If you are an international player, someone like Miroslav Klose, they are already impressed so you don't have to convince them.""
Wübbenhorst spent a season at RB Leipzig in 2019-20 as part of Julian Nagelsmann's backroom team and understands first-hand the challenges of working with top-level professional men.
""There are so many foreign players at top clubs with different views of the world,"" Wübbenhorst explained. ""You have to be open-minded... their sensitivity is higher because they are used to be in the spotlight, they're used to earning a lot of money so when you criticize them, you have to do it very, very carefully.""
Eta's historic appointment should open the door for more women to follow but unlike in the US, where female assistant coaches of men's sports teams is long established, there is greater resistance in Europe.
Wübbenhorst believes Eta's promotion at Union makes things easier, but that it will still take time for ingrained attitudes to shift.
""When you are the first person to do something, it's hard because the media look at every word you say... but when you are the second or third, it will be so much easier,"" she said. ""The management of the clubs have to see that it works. So they will decide more often to choose a woman for this position.
 ""In Europe — England, Spain, Germany — football is a man's game,"" she said. ""When the role of women changes, and there is a change happening in the whole of society, it becomes easier. Because the management see that there are strong women too, and it doesn't depend on whether it's a man or a woman to be a good coach.
""This has to go on for a few years, but right now it's older men who hold the money and make the decisions of who will be the coach, and I think that has to change, and that needs a few years more.""
In the meantime, Wübbenhorst says women shouldn't feel pressure ""to be like the men"". In her opinion, it's crucial for female coaches to be themselves, and she has never felt any pressure to obscure aspects of her feminity in order to succeed in the men's game.
 ""You can't be a better man because you're a woman,"" she says. ""I am a strong personality, it doesn't depend on my sex if I'm strong or not. 
""There was one time when I wanted to paint my nails and I thought 'well, we have a game on the weekend, maybe I shouldn't stand there with painted nails.' That was the only time in my whole career I thought about this. But now I'm older and more experienced and I think 'why not? It doesn't make me a good or a bad coach.'""
Painted nails or not, Eta will take her place in the dugout on Wednesday and has already demonstrated that she is a pioneer. The question now is whether attitudes will loosen further in the men's game and more women will be able to follow her lead at the top level, both in Germany and beyond.

https://www.dw.com/en/why-is-albanias-opposition-lighting-fires-and-setting-off-smoke-bombs-in-parliament/a-67532445,POLITICS,Why is Albania's opposition lighting fires and setting off smoke bombs in parliament? 23.11.2023,"With flames and smoke bombs, jostling lawmakers and chairs piled up in front of the speakers' podium, Monday's debate on the 2024 budget in the Albanian parliament certainly did not go smoothly.
This is not the first time proceedings in the Albanian parliament have been interrupted in this way. There have been several incidents of this kind in recent weeks.
The chaos in the parliament chamber was instigated by a group of members of the opposition Democratic Party (DP) led by former Prime Minister Sali Berisha. The DP launched a campaign of political disruption — which it called ""Battle in parliament, dialog with citizens"" — in early November.
Amid the commotion and the smoke, the DP did not have enough votes on its own to stop the ruling Socialist Party (SP) from approving the state budget for 2024. But was the disruption even about the budget? And if not, what is really behind this extraordinary campaign of upheaval?
Sali Berisha said on Monday that the purpose of the disturbance was ""to restore the constitutional rights of the parliamentary opposition and members of the opposition violated by the socialist majority.""
Lutfi Dervishi, former executive director of Transparency International Albania says that the current political activities of the opposition are the result of ""an overlapping of several crises in Albania.""
""There is a crisis in the way parliament functions that comes from the arrogance of the socialist majority and its non-respect of the constitution,"" Dervishi told DW. ""The demand for the establishment of investigative commissions is a constitutional right, which the socialist majority denies the opposition.""
According to Dervishi, there are other examples of the authoritarian style of SP's parliamentary majority: ""There is the personalization of power and the rejection of consultations on controversial decisions,"" he said.
The most recent illustration of this, he adds, was the agreement signed in early November by Albanian prime minister Edi Rama and Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni on setting up in Albania two centers to host migrants from North Africa and the Middle East who were rescued at sea. ""It was signed in darkness and with a total lack of transparency,"" says Dervishi.
There are, however, other factors at play in the recent parliamentary turbulence. At the end of October, Berisha and his son-in-law were charged with corruption by prosecutors of Albania's Special Anti-Corruption and Organized Crime Structure (SPAK). The charges relate to a land deal involving the grounds of a sports' club in the Albanian capital, Tirana.
Berisha's son-in-law was arrested, and Berisha himself, who enjoys immunity from prosecution as a lawmaker, was ordered to report twice a month to the judicial police — which he has so far refused to do — and prohibited from traveling abroad.
Berisha has accused Rama of orchestrating the prosecution against him, an accusation Rama denies.
But not everyone in the DP is behind Berisha. His opponents within the party claim that the real reason for these attempts to block parliament is that Berisha wants to protect his ""vital interests"" — in other words his family's wealth — from SPAK investigators.
The start of the current tension and chaos in parliament coincides not only with start of the investigations into Berisha but also with a deepening of the crisis within the DP.
This crisis began two years ago when Berisha was excluded from the parliamentary party after he was publicly designated by the United States and barred from traveling there because of ""involvement in significant corruption"" in May 2021.
The DP parliamentary party subsequently split into two factions, one that backed Berisha and one that opposed him. Since then, the two factions have failed to resolve their differences and stand as a viable political alternative to the SP.
""Berisha is holding both the party's division and its unity hostage,"" Aleksander Cipa, chairman of the Union of Albanian Journalists, told DW. ""His political actions suggest that the DP can only be united on one non-negotiable condition: Either he becomes the party leader again or he trusts someone else to lead it.""
Other experts feel that although the DP is deeply divided, there is a way out of the current crisis. ""The DP needs an open-minded, sincerely democratic leader,"" says Fatos Tarifa, professor of Sociology and International Relations at the University of New York Tirana.
""The only solution for the DP is to once and for all get rid of Berisha, open up to criticism and reorganize itself, rally behind a democratic leader, and actively participate in the parliament and political life of the country,"" Tarifa told DW.
In the three decades since the collapse of communism in Albania, the opposition has never been weaker than it is today. Rama's government, which is currently serving its third term, is firmly in the driving seat.
""There are no political alternatives in Albania. Prime Minister Rama is currently stronger than ever. The only opposition to his governance is SPAK,"" said Lutfi Dervishi.
The European Commission's Albania 2023 Report voiced concern about the seemingly unlimited power of the government and the fact that the parliament, judiciary and Albanian society as a whole were unable to limit this power. ""Parliament’s oversight of the executive remained limited,"" said the report. ""Public consultation with civil society and interest groups remained formal.""
Albania has introduced a number of judicial reforms in recent years in the hope that these will smooth its path towards membership of the European Union. Some Albanians now hope that this will mean that corrupt politicians will no longer get off scot-free in the future.
Lutfi Dervishi believes that this will take time: ""Reformed justice is still in its initial phase. It will take time for Albania to have proper justice with judges of indisputable integrity.""
The case against Berisha will be a test of whether the culture of impunity in Albania really is being dismantled. If investigations into his and his family's dealings are postponed or prolonged indefinitely, there is a risk of a dramatic collapse of trust in the judiciary and a strong politicization of the new Albanian justice system.
But not everyone is pessimistic. ""I sincerely believe that justice reform is moving ahead,"" Prof. Fatos Tarifa told DW. ""The case of Berisha and his family will prove my optimism and the optimism and hopes of most of Albanians.""

https://www.dw.com/en/german-alpine-club-wins-sustainability-prize/a-67502925,TRAVEL,German Alpine Club wins sustainability prize 21.11.2023,"The dramatic impact of climate change on the Alpine ecosystem is impossible to overlook, said Steffen Reich, who heads the nature conservation unit of the German Alpine Association (DAV). Glaciers are melting, the risk of rockfall is increasing and entire hiking routes have become impassible.
""We are directly affected by climate change,"" said Reich. ""And that makes us realize we have to do something.""
The association, which has almost 1.5 million members, trails and Alpine huts across Germany, promotes sustainable hiking, mountaineering, mountain biking and skiing.
The DAV has been committed to nature conservation and climate protection for many years. To this end, the organization devised an ambitious climate plan in 2021, which has now earned it the 2024 German Sustainability Award.
The jury said the accolade was well deserved because the DAV is a ""key player driving sustainable change in the leisure industry.""
The DAV is aiming to become fully climate neutral by the end of the decade. It wants to achieve this goal by avoiding greenhouse gas emissions, ""instead of making compensation payments,"" said Reich.
The organization is meticulous about its carbon accounting. Each year, all 356 of its regional member clubs calculate their exact carbon footprint. Based on this data, the DAV learned that it had generated a total of 51,000 tons of CO2 in 2022.
It has pledged to set aside €90 (about $98) for each ton, which will be invested into climate-friendly measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, said Reich. The funds will go toward ""improving infrastructure, running education programs and buying climate-friendly buses,"" among other things. The DAV plans to invest €140 per ton starting in 2025.
Moreover, the mountaineering association is currently working to convert all its facilities, which include over 300 Alpine huts, to run on green energy. Solar panels are being fitted and much is being done to improve overall energy efficiency.
But by far the largest share of greenhouse emissions stems from transport, specifically, getting into and up Germany's steep mountains, said Reich. Not all of Germany's mountainous regions are serviced by public buses and trains. For this reason, the DAV has set up a carpooling platform so that mountain sports enthusiasts can share a ride instead taking their own car.
The association, which was established in 1869, has always been committed to protecting the natural beauty of the Alps, said Reich.
That's one reason why Reich is against developing untouched areas of the Alps. This applies in particular to the expansion of ski resorts, but also to large infrastructure projects such as the planned pumped-storage hydroelectricity plant in Austria's Platzertal valley.
The DAV has not only enshrined nature convention in its statues, but now has also formally committed itself to climate protection.
The German Sustainability Award has been awarded since 2008 by the eponymous foundation in collaboration with the World Wildlife Fund and the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry, as well as the German Environment Ministry. It is considered one of the most important accolades in this field.
The award ceremony will take place on November 23 and 24 in Dusseldorf. A total of 100 companies from 20 different industries will receive the coveted award this year.
""We were very pleased about getting the prize,"" said Reich. ""After all, this is a prestigious accolade.""

This year's host was India, with the final match played at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad in the western Gujarat state. A crowd of over 92,000 people attended the event.
Australia has the most World Cup wins of any team. India's last global title was the 2013 Champions Trophy.
Opener Travis Head hit 137, propelling Australia towards victory.
Australia reached its target in 43 overs, breaking India's winning streak of 10 matches. India was held to a modest 240 total.
In the group stage just six weeks ago, India was holding a slim lead.
Australia was defeated by India on October 8 and then by South Africa days later.
India star batsman Virat Kohli ended the Sunday match having set a new record for most runs — 765 — at a single World Cup.
Pat Cummins said captaining Australia in the World Cup was the ""pinnacle in cricket"" following the win.
""That's huge, that's the pinnacle in cricket, winning a World Cup, especially here in India, and these are the moments you remember for the rest of your life,"" said Cummins.
""I was a little bit nervous this morning, pacing around the hotel,"" he said. ""You know you are walking into something very special.""
India coach Rahul Dravid hailed captain Rohit Sharma's ""fantastic"" performance despite the host country's loss.
""His batting was fantastic, the way he set the tone for us. We knew we wanted to play a certain way and we wanted to play a positive attacking brand of cricket,"" Dravid told reporters. ""And he was very committed to doing that.""
""He wanted to lead by example. I thought right through the tournament, he was quite superb in doing that. And yeah, I just can't speak more highly of him as a person and as a leader.""
He said that India would learn from the defeat.
""That's sport. That happens. And the better team won on the day. I'm sure the sun will come up tomorrow morning. We'll learn from it. We'll reflect and move on, as will everyone else,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/endangered-adder-snake-is-germanys-reptile-of-the-year/a-67483104,SCIENCE,Endangered adder snake is Germany's 'reptile of the year' 19.11.2023,"Germany's reptile of the year for 2024 is the common European adder (Vipera berus), scientists said in a press release published on Sunday.
The German Association for Herpetology and Terrarium Science (DGHT) called the reptile a ""snake of superlatives,"" saying that its traditional habitat covers a ""massive total area in Europe and Asia.""
""It stretches from England to the Russian island of Sakhalin"" in the Far East, it said, adding that the common adder is ""the only snake that can be found beyond the arctic circle.""
It is the only venomous snake found in Germany other than the asp viper, which is localized to the Black Forest region in the southwestern Baden-Württemberg state.
The common adder is ""severely threatened"" in Germany and is at risk due the effects of climate change, as it thrives in colder climates. This has prompted the DGHT to recommend conservation measures such as the preservation, linking and optimization of already existing habitats, as well as the rewilding of specimens in captivity.
According to the DGHT, the 5,000-member association is the largest in the world that deals with the conservation and study of amphibians and reptiles. It has handed out the titles ""reptile of the year"" and ""amphibian of the year"" since 2006 with the goal of raising awareness.
While adder bites can be painful and cause swelling, they are very rarely dangerous for humans. ""However, it is important to take an adder bite seriously, stay calm and seek medical help if necessary,"" the DGHT recommends.
The female of the species grows to around 90 centimeters (35.4 inches) long and is covered in various brown hues. Males are somewhat smaller, at around 60 centimeters long, and tend to be of light gray or silver color. Auburn and black specimens can also be found.
The snake has a characteristic wavy stripe along its back and also sports vertical pupils, according to the DGHT. Such pupils are also present in the smooth snake, which is not venomous but ""is often confused with the common adder.""
The animal is largely diurnal and lives in heathland and moorland habitats, as well as on the edge of forests and in clearings. It eats lizards, frogs and small mammals and is in turn preyed on by wild boars, martens and buzzards.
Large adder populations can be found in the North German Plain, the eastern Central Uplands, the Alps, the Black Forest region and in the Bavarian Forest that straddles Germany's border with the Czech Republic.
Although the animal is threatened in Germany, the UK-based International Union for the Conservation of Nature classified it as a species of ""least concern"" in its 2016 global assessment.

https://www.dw.com/en/100-years-after-nazi-olympics-should-berlin-host-in-2036/a-67481328,SPORTS,100 years after 'Nazi Olympics': Should Berlin host in 2036? 19.11.2023,"Whether it be in 2036 or 2040, Berlin is ready to host the summer Olympics. That was the message after the city's Governing Mayor, Kai Wegner, and Sports Senator, Iris Spranger, signed a document to signal their intentions. ""We want the Games to be not only for, but above all with, the people of Berlin,"" said Wegner.
If Berlin wins the bid for 2036, the Olympics would take place exactly 100 years after the 1936 Games staged by the National Socialist, or Nazi, party. This has drawn criticism from some, who consider it disrespectful. ""It gives the strange impression of a 100-year celebration,"" said historian Oliver Hilmes in German newspaper, Tagesspiegel. According to Hilmes, a lot of thought would need to be given to putting the history in proper context.
The opposition in the Berlin Senate criticized the project for other reasons. The Green party pointed to the sometimes precarious condition of Berlin's sports facilities and the urgent need for renovation of sports grounds, gyms and swimming pools. ""Before we invest billions in a major sporting event, we need to concentrate on getting our sports facilities and clubs in shape,"" said Klara Schedlich, spokesperson for sports policy for the party.
Guests visiting the Games from abroad in 1936 experienced a perfectly organized, bombastic sporting event in the Berlin summer. Almost 4,000 athletes from 49 nations represented a record number of participants at the time. The number of visitors exceeded all previous records. In the cafes and dance halls of the German capital, people partied and enjoyed life for 16 days.
But at the same time, the Games were a major staging and propaganda coup for the Nazis. For the last time in their reign, which lasted until 1945, they presented themselves to the outside world as peaceful. As early as the summer of 1933, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi government had issued a declaration, as requested by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), that the Games were open to ""all races and denominations.""
However, there were several events in the run-up to the Games that showed the true intention of the Nazis. In 1935, the Nuremberg Race Laws were passed, which made their antisemitic and racist ideology clear. In the same year, they increased their armed forces from 100,000 to over half a million soldiers. In addition, the Rhineland, in the west of Germany, was occupied by the military in 1936, thus breaking international agreements.
The Weimar Republic was still democratic when the Games were awarded to Germany in 1931. Many critics say that they should have been taken back after Hitler and the National Socialists seized power in January 1933. But this did not happen. Even a long-discussed Olympic boycott by the Americans and other nations did not ultimately take place. Hitler got his big sporting stage and made the most of it.
A century after the ""Nazi games under the swastika,"" the city could show how diverse and open the sports metropolis of Berlin is today, said Wegner. His predecessor in office, the current Berlin Senator for Economic Affairs, Franziska Giffey, also sees benefits.
""We have already seen what a positive effect this has had on the city with the Special Olympics this year, if only in terms of the many guests who boost tourism,"" she said. ""If the Olympic Games are held successfully, then the economic effect can be felt throughout Berlin.""
Support of the idea is not restricted to local politicians. Jens-Christian Wagner, for example, told German media outlet Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk, that the idea of bringing the 2036 Olympics to Berlin was a good one. Wagner is the director of the Buchenwald Memorial Foundation. Buchenwald near Weimar was home to the largest concentration camp on German soil from 1937 to 1945.
However, according to Wagner, an intensive examination of the appropriation of the 1936 Games by the National Socialists is also essential. ""On the one hand, sports facilities that were already used in 1936 will also be used,"" he said, adding that those would have to be used carefully. ""We have to deal with this very consciously and the question of how sport can be misused for political purposes has to be addressed,"" said Wagner.
IOC President Thomas Bach has recently dampened the potential Olympic ambitions of his home country. He would be ""very happy"" about an Olympic Games in Germany but, due to the country's entry restrictions on certain people in response to the Russian war on Ukraine, Germany would not be an option as host — at least for the time being. ""The IOC can only award games where its rules are respected,"" said Bach. ""This includes ensuring that every participant accredited by the IOC is allowed to enter.""
The next three Summer Games have been awarded to Paris (2024), Los Angeles (2028) and Brisbane (2032), while the next Winter Games will take place in Milan/Cortina d'Ampezzo in 2026. The hosts of the 2030 and 2034 Winter Games will be named next year in a double award.
That means Berlin could only host the Games in 2036 at the earliest. However, the competition is already fierce. According to Bach, there is a ""healthy double-digit number of interested parties."" The big favorite so far is India.

https://www.dw.com/en/f1-las-vegas-gp-offers-reminder-of-german-absence/a-67452472,SPORTS,F1: Las Vegas GP offers reminder of German absence 17.11.2023,"The glitz and glamour of Las Vegas was always likely to appeal to Formula One's US owners , given the sport's long history of luxury and excess. The fact a farcical first practice had to be abandoned because of a loose maintenance hole cover is unlikely to deter them. 
A third annual grand prix in the United States, to go along with races in Austin and Miami, also means traditional European races are being squeezed out, with the push into new lucrative markets such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar lessening their chances even more.
Former Mercedes motorsport boss Norbert Haug believes F1 seeking new frontiers heralds the end of hopes that a German Grand Prix might one day return to the F1 calendar. Germany was once a powerhouse of the sport, but the last proper race in Germany outside of the COVID pandemic was in 2019 — and there are no signs it will reappear.
""The European heritage of Formula One will not be lost, but the German one will,"" Haug told DW. ""In the first decade of the 2000s, there were two German Formula One races per year, each with 100,000 spectators and always over 5 million viewers for...live broadcasts. Today, perhaps 10% of this number watch Formula One on TV in Germany, there have been no races in Germany for a long time and there is no German winning driver in sight.""
American conglomerate Liberty Media bought Formula One in 2017 for $4.6 billion (€4.25 billion) and despite the IndyCar series dominating motor sport in the US, the firm felt it could make inroads in its home market with F1, as well as raking in the money from Asian nations desperate for the prestige of holding a race. Critics say the likes of Saudi Arabia are only hosting grands prix in order to sportswash — boost their image through sport and attempt to deflect attention from domestic problems such as human rights abuses.
The inaugural Las Vegas race along the famous Strip — in stark contrast to 1981 and 1982 races held in the car park of the Caesars Palace Hotel and Casino — might not count as sportswashing, but world champion Max Verstappen has no doubt about the real motives.
""It''s 99% show and 1% sporting event,"" the Dutchman told reporters in Nevada. ""I guess they still make money if I like it or not, so it's not up to me. But I'm also not going to fake it, I just always voice my opinion on positive things and negative things. That's just how I am. Some people like the show a bit more, I don't like it at all.""
The practice lasting only 8 minutes because of safety fears after Carlos Sainz's Ferrari drove over the loose drain cover seemed to back up Verstappen's point. But a 10-year deal with Las Vegas shows F1's trend is clear. Indeed, of 22 races on this year's calendar, 14 are outside Europe. In the 1990s the vast majority of races were in Europe, where most of the teams are still based.
F1's turn away from Europe is best demonstrated by looking at Germany's fortunes.
Michael Schumacher, Sebastian Vettel and Nico Rosberg were all German world champions, winning 12 titles in 22 years between 1994 and 2016. The sport had as many as seven German drivers in 2012.
Now the only real German presence in F1 is driver Nico Hülkenberg, from US also-ran team Haas. The Mercedes F1 team — all-conquering before Red Bull and Verstappen stole their crown — are actually based in Britain despite the car company being one of several famous German auto brands. Team principal Toto Wolff is Austrian.
There was the so-called Eifel Grand Prix held in 2020 on Germany's Nürburgring but it was only a one-off stopgap because teams had difficulty flying out of Europe during the pandemic. There was never a concrete suggestion that it would remain on the calendar in normal times.
The French Grand Prix has suffered a similar fate, yet there are two European races which were added to the calendar again relatively recently. Austria has been a mainstay since 2014 and the Netherlands since 2021, but F1 only likes going there because Red Bull owns the Austrian track in Spielberg and can guarantee a party while Verstappen ensures hordes of orange-clad fans splash the cash at the Dutch race.  
""Germany owes a large part of its prosperity to the automobile and every German Formula One race has always generated over €10 million in taxes for the state coffers,"" said Haug. ""But small countries such as Austria or the Netherlands are now Formula One strongholds. The older ones among us remember that Germany was once by far the most successful Formula One nation.""
A record 24 races are planned in Formula One in 2024, with China returning after a four-year hiatus due to COVID. F1 has tried to take a race to Vietnam and while grands prix in India and South Korea failed, four races in the Arab world and five in North America tell their own story.
It's not all bad news for Europe. The Monaco Grand Prix — F1's most iconic event through the twisting streets of Monte Carlo and past the yachts of the super-rich — did look to be in some danger a few years ago, with F1's owners seeing the race as antiquated. But a new deal was signed until 2025, with the Belgian Grand Prix at fabled Spa — a favorite track of the drivers — also having a contract for two more years at least.
Haug believes these grands prix are too important to F1 to be ditched, meaning there is no space for some other European destinations.
""These races are secured for the long term and as certain as it is that these races will be held in the next 10 years, there will certainly be none in Germany,"" he said.
The extravagance of Las Vegas would seem to fly in the face of F1's goal to be greener. The sport aims to reduce CO2 emissions generated by operations, events, logistics and race cars to net zero by 2030. Flying to the other side of the world from European bases is an issue which has to be overcome, but Haug thinks street races like those in Las Vegas might actually help F1 with its target.
""I'm sure there are fewer cars in Las Vegas on a Formula One weekend than on an average weekend, so the environmental impact is only a fraction of what it would otherwise be,"" he said.
It's another mortal blow to Germany's hopes of an F1 return.

https://www.dw.com/en/why-are-more-asian-americans-buying-guns/a-67396149,SOCIETY,Why are more Asian Americans buying guns? 15.11.2023,"David Liu's gun shop looks unsuspecting from the outside. Nestled into the back of a quiet strip mall in Arcadia, near Los Angeles, Liu keeps the overhead sign of the sushi restaurant that once occupied his living-room-sized shop. He does this to remain discreet, saying the people who need to find him will seek him out. 
Liu posts fliers on his windows offering Concealed Carry Weapons (CCW) license classes in Mandarin and English, pasted below his Trump 2020 flag, orchids and decorative fish.
Liu says roughly half of his customers are Asian — primarily Chinese — and conduct transactions in their native language.
Many of his customers at his shop are like friends — regulars who come by for multiple training sessions, paperwork, or to chat. Several of them are new gun owners driven by fears over rising levels of violence and hate crimes, which increased by over 330% between 2020 and 2021, according to a report by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism published in 2022.
Arcadia is a predominantly Asian area just a few minutes from Monterey Park, the site of a deadly mass shooting following a Lunar New Year Festival this year.
Asian Americans traditionally have the lowest rates of ownership than any other measured demographic in the US, but saw a 43% rise in ownership between 2019 and 2020, starting with the pandemic. The COVID-19 outbreak reportedly spurred public scapegoating of Asians in the US. Crimes such as robberies and home burglaries have also increased in recent years following the pandemic and a rapid rise in the cost of living.
Liu says that in the LA area, Chinese people are sometimes violently targeted both publicly and in their homes due to a stereotype of keeping large amounts of cash on hand.
""The situation is getting worse,"" says Ray Gong, 27, a customer of Liu's. ""I just got out of the military recently, and hearing the news, my mind changed.""
Gong arrived in the US in 2016 from Hangzhou, an eastern city in China just south of Shanghai. He purchased his first pistol in August and another two firearms in September, hoping to ""be ready for anything.""
He says that while he hasn't experienced violence related to his ethnicity, he was discriminated against in the military, where he was prevented from taking on higher roles due to being Chinese and was often handed the work that nobody else wanted.
He is also in the process of obtaining his CCW, which typically takes over six months in California. ""I'm thinking about carrying it (a gun) all the time.""
Gong is now a member of a nearby shooting range and says he works on target practice at least once a week.
In a Public Policy Institute of California survey last year, two-thirds of Californians saw crime as a serious problem.
""Everyone (not just Asian Americans) is buying more guns,"" says Liu. ""People are scared.""
Ricky Wong, 44, a legal administrator, says that in the last few years, he survived a violent attack with a baseball bat and two car thefts. The attack, he said, was carried out by other Asians. He was a gun owner before, but the attack and robberies validated his decision to be armed.
One of the solutions to rising violent crimes in California, Wong and Liu say, is to get tough on crime again, citing multiple murderers who were released after what they see as much-too-brief stints in prison.
Chris Cheng, a sport shooter and founding member of the Asian Pacific American Gun Owners Association, echoed the sentiment that law enforcement is not effectively tackling violent crime.
""The lack of prosecution"" by district attorneys in major cities, including Los Angeles and his home, San Francisco, against criminals perpetrating racist attacks against Asians decreased the community's confidence in the criminal justice system.
""Combine that with the increased civil unrest with the George Floyd riots and the January 6 insurrection, it should come as no surprise that many Asian Americans began to understand that law enforcement cannot protect them.""
However, not everyone feels that firearms are not the answer to rising hate crimes. ""The firearms industry and gun lobby are currently targeting minority communities in their marketing in response to long-term stagnation in the traditional gun market of white men,"" according to a report issued by the Washington-based Violence Policy Center.
""As a result of their increasing size and consumer power, Asian Americans are viewed as an untapped market by gunmakers,"" it said.
Liu sees the motivation of his customers not as a result of marketing but as a result of fear. ""It's just so dangerous out there. A lot of people buying are victims already.""

https://www.dw.com/en/israel-sports-stop-amid-hamas-war-and-fears-over-security/a-67399112,SPORTS,Israel: Sports stop amid Hamas war and fears over security 15.11.2023,"Professional football leagues in Israel are set to return to action on November 25, with the games taking place without supporters for the time being after coming to a halt due to the latest Israel-Hamas conflict.
Some clubs in southern cities, such as SC Ashdod and Hapoel Be'er Sheva, are not likely to be able to host games immediately because of the likelihood of sirens sounding their warnings during matches.
Another issue for Israeli football is the participation of foreign players and coaches, some of whom haven't returned to the country since the war in Gaza started.
According to club estimates, some 60% of foreign players are not expected to return from the conflict-induced hiatus. The most prominent name is former Tottenham striker Robbie Keane, now head coach of Maccabi Tel Aviv.
After joining the club before the season, the Irishman faced public criticism in his home country linked to the ongoing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. He insisted he'd rather focus on the sport and would not comment on the political situation in the country.
Keane has maintained his stance after the Hamas terrorist attacks on southern Israel on October 7, refusing to say anything about the conflict. This drew criticism from some prominent football figures in Israel.
Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by Israel, the European Union, the United States and others.
Israeli Premier League rules allow clubs to sign up to six foreign players, with a maximum of five allowed to be on the pitch at any one time.
Most clubs now believe this season is about minimizing the financial damage caused by the war by securing the income from the country's national betting institution and the TV rights holders. Some believe a fair solution would be to freeze relegations and increase the Israeli top flight from 14 to 16 clubs for one season.
The government has said it will compensate sports clubs for their lost income. Miki Zohar, the Israeli sports minister, said he's in contact with the army to ensure fans can return to attending games as quickly as possible.
Unlike the professional football leagues, there is no immediate plan for the country's top basketball division to return to action. One idea under consideration is playing in a ""bubble"" similar to the one the NBA used during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hadera or Afula, seen as low-risk cities for potential rocket attacks, were among the proposed sites for such a concept.
Just as in football, the games are expected to take place without supporters.
Despite this, two of the country's top teams have been playing their European games abroad. Maccabi Tel Aviv, Israel's most decorated basketball club, has set up shop in Belgrade for their home games in the EuroLeague, Europe's top basketball competition.
City rivals Hapoel Tel Aviv, whose fans have been particularly affected by the October 7 massacre, have had their home games in the EuroCup, the second-tier European basketball competition, postponed. However, they played their European away games, securing three wins and one defeat.
Israeli basketball is highly dependent on foreign players, and just like in football, many of them are expected not to return to Israel when the league returns to action. Some clubs have already started releasing their foreign players despite the season barely starting.
When it comes to Olympic sports, many Israeli athletes are currently not taking part in international competitions due to potential security threats, with those that do feeling the situation abroad, too.
The Israeli fencing team had to evacuate from their hotel in Bern, Switzerland, due to a bomb threat. After six hours of waiting in the dressing room of the sports hall where they had competed, they received the news that the hotel was safe and nothing had been found.
The fencing team is not the only one affected by the situation.
The country's artistic swimming team took to their Instagram account to express their feelings ahead of the Olympic qualification event in Qatar, saying they are not likely to participate due to the situation.
""We are scared that Munich 1972 will happen again,"" they wrote, referring to the terrorist attack against Israel's Olympic delegation that claimed the lives of 11 Israeli athletes.

https://www.dw.com/en/matilda-named-australias-2023-word-of-the-year/a-67403184,CULTURE,'Matilda’ named Australia’s 2023 word of the year 15.11.2023,"The massive popularity of Australia's women's football team is one for the history books: ""Matilda"" has been named Australia's word of the year.
The football team, called the ""Matildas"" or Tillies for short, finished fourth at the Women’s Fifa World Cup in August.
Their semi-final match against England was the most-watched TV program in Australia since 2001, reaching more than 11 million viewers. 
Their success swept the country, with Matildas on banners at pubs and living rooms.
The Australian National Dictionary Centre, based at the Australian National University, selects a word or expression that has gained prominence in the Australian landscape over the past 12 months.
The Centre’s Director Dr Amanda Laugesen said this year’s choice was easy given the massive popularity of the team and the word’s long history in Australian English.
She said it also reflects the growth of interest in women’s team sports.
“From the 1880s, matilda was one of the names for a swag, a bag of possessions carried by an itinerant man looking for work. These days most people would only know this in relation to the song Waltzing Matilda,” Dr Laugesen said.
“It’s only since the mid-1990s that the women’s soccer team has been called the Matildas, but after this year’s World Cup the word has once again cemented itself in the Australian lexicon.""

https://www.dw.com/en/ferrari-250-gto-fetches-more-than-50-million-at-auction/a-67391327,CARS AND TRANSPORTATION,Ferrari 250 GTO fetches more than $50 million at auction 14.11.2023,"A 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO became the second-most-expensive car ever sold at auction on Monday, fetching $51,705,000 (roughly €48,300,000) at Sotheby's in New York.
The classic scarlet chassis, formerly a Ferrari works racer but later refitted for road use, had been the property of an American collector for the past 38 years. 
RM Sotheby's, the luxury car subsidiary of the auction house, had predicted a slightly higher sale price — in the region of $60 million. 
It did not identify Monday's buyer of a car it touted as ""a speed machine so celebrated that it qualifies as the very definition of a legend.""  
The car, chassis number 3765, was inititally built for the racetrack by Ferrari and installed with a larger, experimental 4 liter capacity engine.
""As one of 34 GTO examples built with Tipo 1962 coachwork, and the only example originally equipped with a 4-liter engine, chassis number 3765 has been profiled several times in the Ferrari-focused publications Prancing Horse and Cavallino, and its period racing career was documented in magazines like Sports Car Graphic, Road & Track, and Autosport,"" Sotheby's said of the lot. 
It finished second in the 1962 1,000 km endurance race on the German Nürburgring Nordschleife circuit, as well as competing in the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans that year, when the team had to withdraw due to engine failure, according to RM Sotheby's.
""Ford v Ferrari"" (titled ""Le Mans '66"" in the UK and other territories) is a new sports biopic about a team of US engineers who challenged in 1966 Ferrari, the perennial winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the world's oldest active endurance sports car race. Starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, it portrays the golden era of sports racing and how the will of individuals can beat bureaucracy.










Chassis 3765, with Tipo coachwork by Scaglietti, was later restored and converted to road-going specs with a standard 3 liter engine as it was sold into private ownership in the US.
It changed hands several times before winding up with a collector in Ohio, Monday's seller, Sotheby's said. 
The 1960s battles with between Ferrari's 250 GTOs and Ford's GT40s at Le Mans became a legendary endurance racing tale of the era and helps explain the car still commanding such high prices in the US as well as Europe.  
For decades, the 250 GTO had been broadly considered the world's most expensive car, even though many recent sales have been private with prices only reported or rumored. 
But that record was obliterated last year by the auction of a 1955 Mercedes 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupe. 
The Uhlenhaut fetched €135 million, or $144 million at today's exchange rate, which is thought to be at least $60 million more even than any past private car sale. 
However, the model in question's utterly unique nature — the result of its starring role in racing's most deadly ever accident — explains the meteoric sale price in this case. 
Only two road-ready 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupes were ever made. A racing model was involved in a major crash at the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans. It catapulted into the spectator area, as did its engine and other large parts of debris, killing more than 100 spectators and wounding many more. 
Mercedes then canceled its plans to build more hard-top 300 SLRs for the road in the aftermath of the tragedy, and never sold the two road-going models it had made — until the shock, confidential 2022 auction. 

The 250 GTO meanwhile can continue to claim to be the most expensive road-going car ever put into wider production and sold to the public. Another sold at auction for roughly $44 million in 2018 and private sales are rumored to have stretched as high as $60 million or $70 million.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-46-million-adults-addicted-to-gambling-or-at-risk/a-67387841,HEALTH,Germany: 4.6 million adults addicted to gambling or at risk 13.11.2023,"Approximately 1.3 million adults in Germany suffer from a gambling disorder and a further 3.3 million show initial signs of gambling addiction, according to a new report presented by the country's Federal Drugs Commissioner Burkhard Blienert on Monday.
According to ""The Gambling Atlas,"" which draws on data compiled in 2021, 30% of German adults gamble. The figure represents a reduction on the 55% calculated in 2007, but the report nevertheless found that 7.7% of adults suffer financial, social or health problems associated with addition.
""Gambling rarely makes participants happy,"" said Commissioner Blienert on Monday, presenting the report in Berlin.
""Gambling is a disease,"" added Christina Rummel of the German Center for Addiction Issues (DHS).
The report, published jointly by the Institute for Interdisciplinary Addiction and Drug Research in Hamburg, the German Centre for Addiction Issues in Hamm and the Gambling Research Department at the University of Bremen, provides a general overview of the state of gambling in Germany.
It identified men and young adults aged 21 to 35 as particularly susceptible to gambling problems, as well as people with psychological disorders and high levels of alcohol consumption.
The report defines gambling addiction as ""excessive and destructive participation"" in gambling during which gamblers suffer a loss of control, gamble more and more money, lie to conceal their addiction and become isolated from their social circles.
People with migratory backgrounds are also at particular risk, according to the report, with gambling expert Tobias Hayer telling Germany's Catholic News Agency (KNA) that gambling can become a form of self-medication for migrants who have suffered trauma, or who find themselves marginalized from society and struggling financially.
The COVID-19 pandemic also provided fertile ground for gambling addiction as vulnerable people found themselves alone and under financial pressure.
Along with traditional slot machines in games halls and arcades, the report identities the growth of live sports betting as a major field in which gambling addictions occur.
As DW reported in 2022, football is particularly problematic, with one betting firm, BWIN, enjoying official partnerships with the German Football Association (DFB) and several clubs including Borussia Dortmund, Union Berlin, Cologne, St. Pauli and Dynamo Dresden.

Former Bayern Munich goalkeeper, captain and chief executive Oliver Kahn was the public face of betting company Tipico for eight years between 2012 and 2020, and it is almost impossible to watch live football in Germany without being exposed to betting adverts.
""When you call up the Bundesliga results on your smartphone, you're immediately confronted with offers from sports betting companies,"" said Drugs Commissioner Blienert, warning of the dangers of trivializing gambling by associating it with live sports, and calling for tighter restrictions.
""When young people are tempted into gambling via seemingly harmless games, then something isn't right,"" he said, calling for a ban on gambling advertising on television before 11pm.
But with the German gambling industry recording record gross revenues of €13.4 billion ($14.3bn) last year and the German state collecting €5.2bn in taxes from legal gambling in 2021 alone - over twice as much as on alcohol - the industry has a powerful lobby.

Several people were injured by a firecracker at a Bundesliga match in Augsburg in Germany's southeastern state of Bavaria on Saturday.
Augsburg's match against Hoffenheim ended in a 1-1 draw.
The firework was thrown from the Hoffenheim fan block. Police said that at least 11 people were hurt in the loud explosion.
Augsburg managing director Michael Ströll said that one person suffered blast trauma.
""One perpetrator is visible on video images,"" he said.
Ströll said that police were carrying out an investigation into the incident.
The local daily Augsburger Allgemeine reported that police had taken two suspects into custody.
The match was interrupted for around 5 minutes in the 57th minute over the firecracker explosion.
Hoffenheim sporting director Alexander Rosen also went to the Hoffenheim fan block immediately after the incident to calm supporters. Ströll said he paid a ""huge compliment"" to both Rosen and the referee.
""Unbelievable nonsense,"" Rosen said following the match, referring to the violent incident.
The firecracker incident comes a day after clashes between police and fans during the second-division game between St Pauli and Hanover on Friday evening.
Local police said on Saturday that 17 officers and 15 supporters had sustained injuries during the game, with pepper spray visibly used in the altercations. 
Also on Saturday, police clashed with fans at Bochum's game with Cologne, and pepper spray was used.
Cologne's club said that there were problems with entry into the guest area, which resulted in police activity and injuries among fans. Bochum police said that Cologne supporters had wanted to ""directly overrun"" the guest entrance. A supporters' group instead complained on social media of an ""excessive police action."" 
Police have launched investigations into cases of breaches of the peace, violations of the explosives laws and bodily harm.

https://www.dw.com/en/ghana-footballer-raphael-dwamena-dies-after-on-field-collapse/a-67376776,SPORTS,Ghana footballer Raphael Dwamena dies after on-field collapse 11.11.2023,"In the 23rd minute of an Albanian Superliga game between FK Egnatia and Partizani, tragedy struck. Raphael Dwamena collapsed on the field and died on Saturday.
The former Red Bull Salzburg academy player, who won nine caps for Ghana between 2017 and 2018, was stretchered off the field and despite attempts to resuscitate him, he was later pronounced dead.
The talented striker’s stop-start career was blighted by his heart issues, and, despite calls for him to retire earlier, Dwamena was unable to step away from the game he loved.
Dwamena's amateur career began at Red Bull Ghana before his switch to Austria to play in Salzburg. But it was at Austria Lustenau and then FC Zürich where Dwamena announced himself as a top forward, scoring 21 goals in 51 games in the single season he played for the latter in 2017-18.
Zürich were among his former clubs to pay tribute to the stricken forward on social media.
Dwamena's career was held back by a heart condition that was first diagnosed in 2017. In that year, a move to Premier League club Brighton that would have been worth €11.4 million fell through when he failed a medical exam based on his heart issues.
In 2020, while at Spanish club Levante, he was fitted with an implantable cardiovascular-defibrillator (ICD), the type that was fitted to Christian Eriksen after his cardiac arrest on the field in 2021, and has been fitted to other players with heart conditions.
The ICD allowed Levante's club doctors to monitor his heart during games. in October 2020, following a move to Danish club Vejle Boldklub, he was stopped from taking to the pitch after his ICD showed values that were considered too high.
A year later in October 2021, Dwamena was back in Austria playing for Blau-Weiss Linz, when he collapsed on the field during a game. His ICD shocked him back to life but the game was abandoned and his career in Austria was over. 
There were repeated calls for Dwamena to retire from football, including from respected Ghanian doctor Prince Pambo, who in November 2021, shortly after Dwamena collapsed in Austria, called on the forward to consider calling time on his playing career.
""If Dwamena was my patient, I'd sit him down and call a year or two off,” Pambo said in November 2021. ""To deeply go into whatever problem it is, probably I would be tilted towards wanting to prepare him very well for a beautiful retirement from sports.”
Speaking only in a personal capacity, Pambo went on: ""I think, whenever these things happen, a bold decision has to be taken. And I would be tilted towards wanting to prepare my patient to have a clean and very good exit point and see how he can use the experience he got from playing football to help the industry, probably from a technical or administrative point of view.”
Dwamena didn't heed the calls and, in 2023, looked to Albanian Superliga club FK Egnatia to restart his blighted career. Things had been looking up for the talented striker, who had scored 20 times in 28 games, firing his club to the top of the table.
But on Saturday, November 11, midway through the first half of a game between Albania's top two clubs, Dwamena collapsed and died, with his ICD unable to save him this time.

https://www.dw.com/en/cricket-icc-suspends-sri-lanka-over-political-interference/a-67370512,SPORTS,Cricket: ICC suspends Sri Lanka over political interference 10.11.2023,"The International Cricket Council (ICC) suspended Sri Lanka's membership with immediate effect on Friday.
The indefinite ban was down to political meddling, the ICC said, and comes a day after Sri Lanka's parliament asked the board to resign over accusations of corruption.
Cricket's world governing body said it had found that Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) was ""in serious breach of its obligations as a member, in particular, the requirement to manage its affairs autonomously and to ensure that there is no government interference.""
In the aftermath of a disappointing World Cup performance, Sri Lanka's Sports Ministry replaced the national cricket board with an interim committee. However, a court ruling overturned the move and reinstated the old board. 
Despite the Sri Lankan courts halting the move, the effective dismissal of the board and appointment of interim replacements by politicians in the country was apparently sufficient for the ICC to take action.
The conditions of the suspension will be decided by the ICC board in due course, it said in a statement. The board is set to meet on November 21. 
The SLC is the second ICC member to face suspension in the last four years, following a ban on Zimbabwe Cricket in 2019.
While the suspension is in effect, Sri Lanka Cricket's funding from the ICC will be frozen. 
Its men's and women's teams will also be barred from taking part in ICC events, or in other words, any competitive international cricket matches.
Given Sri Lanka's difficult economic situation, barely a year on from a sovereign debt default, there could also be considerable impacts on the domestic game if the suspension endures. Poorer members tend to be more generally reliant on ICC funding for other cricketing expenses.
The country is scheduled to host the under-19 men's World Cup, starting in January, which could provide a motive to the ICC to rapidly resolve the issue.
Sri Lanka Cricket has in two separate statements rejected allegations of corruption from the government in Colombo, which are connected to preparations for hosting that tournament. The government accused the cricket body of transferring roughly $2 million from its accounts to third-party accounts.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-slow-to-take-cte-brain-injury-from-sport-seriously/a-67367317,SPORTS,Germany slow to take CTE brain injury from sport seriously 10.11.2023,"""At least I'm still alive,"" Erich Grau told DW. ""When I go to the cemetery, I think, 'Now they're lying down there.' Six to eight former [American] football players who didn't make it to their 60th birthdays, and they were completely out of it for the last five years of their lives. That's hard to take.""
The now 68-year-old Grau was one of the pioneers of American football in Germany. The founding member of the Ansbach Grizzlies played in the American Football Bundesliga's first season in 1979. He became the German national team's first starting quarterback two years later.
Today, he is the only former professional athlete in Germany to speak publicly about the illness he believes he suffers from:  chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE.
Grau will probably not find out for certain in his lifetime whether he has CTE. To date, the disease can only be definitively diagnosed after death through a brain autopsy. But Grau has been experiencing the symptoms that scientists associate with CTE for over 20 years.
His memory is getting fuzzier and fuzzier. He schedules any conversations with people he doesn't know personally before noon as he can hardly concentrate later in the day.
""I also feel dizzy more and more often,"" he said. ""The MRI shows that my brain is atrophying [shrinking] in all areas.""
His physical coordination is deteriorating as well, he said.
""I know it's not going to get any better. But I'm trying to hold on to what I still have,"" he said.
At the age of 45, the former secondary school teacher first noticed that he was starting to have trouble concentrating and suddenly becoming quick-tempered and aggressive — something that had never been in his nature.
Studies have shown that one's personality can change dramatically during the earliest stage of the disease. The risk of suicide increases and violent outbursts are also possible.
Australian rules football player Heather Anderson took her own life in November 2022 at the age of 28. Philipp Adams, a former cornerback in the National Football League (NFL), shot six people and then himself in April 2021. The autopsies on the brains of Anderson and Adams found that both had been suffering from CTE.
Around 350 cases of CTE have been confirmed in former NFL players. The disease has also been detected in deceased players in other contact sports such as rugby, ice hockey, football, boxing and martial arts.
Their brains were significantly reduced in size. In addition, whole clumps of tau protein were found in the outermost layer of the cerebrum. These tiny protein building blocks stabilize the nerve cells. When the brain makes sudden movements, there is a risk that the proteins will fold incorrectly. This can damage the nerve cell to such an extent that it dies. This can lead to a chain reaction.
Like all neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, CTE is currently incurable. Only the symptoms can be treated.
In the United States, as well as Australia and New Zealand, countries where Aussie rules football and rugby are particularly popular, ""sports brain banks"" have been established. There, donor brains from deceased athletes are collected and studied.
""It would be a dream come true for me if we also had a sports brain bank specializing in CTE in Germany, to which my brain could be taken after my death,"" Grau said.
The German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) is currently setting up a brain bank. Researchers here face a shortage of tissue material, as Germans tend to be more reluctant about organ donations than people in many other countries.
Researchers were aware of the clinical profile of CTE as early as the 1920s. Back then, it was known as dementia pugilistica (boxer's dementia) or simply being punch drunk. Even back then, it was widely thought that heavy blows to the head could cause lasting damage to the brain. Now we know that even repeated minor blows to the head — blows that aren't sufficient to cause a concussion — can have serious consequences.
""If you accumulate these head concussions over many years, they lead to neurodegenerative processes similar to head trauma,"" Inga Körte, professor of neurobiology at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich and Harvard Medical School in Boston told DW.
""This has been established by research over the past 10 years in different sports, age groups and countries. These are robust results.""
But apparently, hardly anyone in Germany is interested.
Körte, who has been conducting research on CTE since 2009, visits sports clubs to inform parents about the possible long-term effects of head concussions.
""At one large football [soccer] club, whose name I won't mention, only one interested father turned up,"" Körte said. ""It's obviously not yet an issue that parents in elite-level sports in this country are dealing with.""
Körte's field of research also includes other ailments such as Alzheimer's Disease or depression.
""It's about brain health as a whole. Can the brain tolerate being constantly shaken? The answer is probably no. Or maybe some brains can tolerate it, but not all of them.""
Erich Grau is convinced that ""certainly a quarter"" of his former football teammates are currently experiencing ""extreme mental decline."" Despite this, they do not talk about the CTE when the guys he played with get together.
""They would rather be the heroes of the past than take these symptoms seriously,"" he said.

To the stadium's gates
Carrying a red scarf
We're roaring the anthem
You'll never walk alone, Hapoel Tel Aviv
(Hapoel Tel Aviv's anthem)
Tel Aviv is a city that is no stranger to graffiti and street art. In the past few weeks, however, many of the city's walls have been covered with names: Those of Hapoel Tel Aviv fans killed by Hamas on October 7.
One of the names written on the walls of the self-proclaimed City that Never Sleeps is that of Omer Hermesh. Hermesh, a Kibbutz Kfar Aza native, was among the club's best-known fans.
""Forever red"" is written on a wall dedicated solely to Hermesh. The club's main ultra group, Ultras Hapoel, signed it, citing the club's anthem: ""You'll never walk alone!""
On the morning of October 7, after Hamas had entered Israel's territory, he posted on Facebook that he had been injured as a result of shots fired at his home by the Islamist militant group but that he had survived the attack.
""I'm lucky to be alive,"" he wrote. ""Regarding my injury, worry not. My hand may be full of blood, but it clotted right away.""
This was the last sign of life from Hermesh. On October 18, 11 days after he was listed as missing, his body was identified, causing shock among Hapoel Tel Aviv's supporters across the country.
According to Uri Maiselman, who knew Hermesh from his many childhood visits to Kfar Aza, Hermesh was known for giving young supporters a feeling of belonging. One way he did this was to provide them with nicknames. At the funeral, people were asked to write the nickname Hermesh had given them on a piece of cardboard and hold it up for all to see. Some 70 people did so. 
""People felt like someone saw them and paid attention to them, that to Omer, they were someone,"" Maiselman told DW.
Lucy Joshua, another Hapoel Tel Aviv fan, said that while she didn't know Hermesh personally, it felt like he was a big part of the Hapoel support nonetheless.
""He didn't give me a nickname,"" she told DW, ""but you had the feeling he was always there.""
John is a match-going Hapoel Tel Aviv supporter who is also a member of Israel's Arab minority. He spoke to DW on the condition that his real name not be used.
""I didn't know any of the victims personally, but in a way, I feel I did know them,"" he said.
The faces, the voices, he said, are familiar to every match-going fan.
""Something will definitely be missing forever.""
We've traveled throughout the country
Everywhere, in every corner,
The heart is red, the name: Hapoel
And again, the melody is being heard.
Instead of football stadiums and basketball arenas, Hapoel Tel Aviv fans had to travel across the country for tragic reasons in the past month. At Hermesh's funeral, thousands of Hapoel Tel Aviv supporters sang their club's anthem. Supporters of other clubs were affected, too.
Some 30 of the club's fans were killed on October 7 by Hamas, which the EU, US, Germany, Israel and others consider a terrorist organization. A few more were taken to Gaza as hostages.
According to Israeli officials, Hamas killed more than 1,400 people during the attacks, and the militant group seized about 240 hostages.
Many Hapoel Tel Aviv fans were among the victims because many of the club's supporters live in a kibbutz, a form of community in which everyone works together, contributing their skills on a voluntary, non-competitive basis.
""Hapoel Tel Aviv is a club established from the workers' movement and traditionally, so were the Kibbutzim,"" long-time Hapoel fan Lucy Joshua explained.
Some kibbutzim affected by the October 7 attacks were Nir Oz, Be'eri and Kfar Aza, where Hermesh lived.
Our home is Ussishkin
We'll never replace it
We love you Hapoel
The Red Devils!
Hapoel Tel Aviv's supporters are known for their diversity, and it's one of two clubs — the other being Maccabi Haifa — that are notable for having a significant number of fans among Arab Israelis. Despite the current war between Israel and Hamas spurring a wave of racism against Israeli citizens of Palestinian descent, the three Hapoel Tel Aviv fans that DW spoke to don't expect the overall tolerant nature of their supporters to change.
""We're strong, and this will only make us stronger,"" said John, also mentioning that many Hapoel fans from the Arab minority joined their Jewish friends from the stands and attended the funerals.
""The love for Hapoel Tel Aviv is all that matters to us, and this will never change,"" he added.
""Hapoel is also Yaffo,"" said Maise lman, thinking ahead to the day after the war is over. Yaffo is the part of Tel Aviv in which Jews and Arabs live together. The area is near the club's Bloomfield Stadium.
""That doesn't mean everything will be perfect because in this country, nothing is perfect, but standing together gives people strength.""
Lucy Joshua agrees.
""For us, it doesn't matter where you're from and who you are, as long as you're Hapoel,"" she said.
""As Omer Hermesh himself once said: We might be famous for being sharp with our words, but we aren't racists!""

https://www.dw.com/en/under-17-world-cup-is-indonesias-second-chance/a-67344569,SPORTS,Under-17 World Cup is Indonesia's second chance 09.11.2023,"The world's most populous Muslim-majority country is set to host its first-ever major global football tournament, the FIFA Under-17 World Cup.
Indonesia, a country of some 280 million people, ""is excited again with the football transformation,"" Indonesian football analyst Hardimen Koto told DW. 
But the reason why Indonesia was stripped of its first chance, a similar opportunity in the spring of this year, will not soon be forgotten. Protests and political remarks against hosting a team from Israel led FIFA to unceremoniously withdraw Indonesia's hosting rights of the more prestigious FIFA Under-20 World Cup.

The tournament was quickly given to Argentina, where Uruguay ran out winners and debutant Israel finished third.
Over six months later, Indonesia's chance to host the FIFA Under-17 World Cup emerged when Peru was deemed ill-prepared for the event.
Had Israel qualified though, ""the U-17 might have stayed in Peru anyway,"" Koto said, ""or FIFA would have looked for another host candidate.""
It was Bali's governor, Wayan Koster, who had latched on to conservative anti-Israel sentiment in March and pushed back against hosting the Israeli team.
Tournament organizers had planned to hold Israel's group stage games in Bali, which is Hindu-majority. But Koster's letter to Indonesia's sports ministry requesting that Israel be banned from his province started turning the tide for FIFA against staging the tournament in Indonesia.
With the Indonesian government reeling from Koster's letter and the 2024 presidential elections on the horizon, conservative Muslim protesters took to the streets of the capital, Jakarta, chanting against Israel's participation while waving Palestinian flags.
President Joko Widodo told the nation: ""Our support for Palestine has always been solid and strong,"" but he said the citizens of Indonesia should ""not mix sports and politics.""
FIFA pulled the plug on it at the end of March.
""FIFA is cognizant of the safety of the team and also audience members,"" Chong Ja Ian, a political scientist and foreign policy researcher at the National University of Singapore, told DW. ""And they don't need to have unrest or a violent incident happen in a U-20 match.""
All parties were especially aware of fan security following the October 2022 Kanjuruhan stadium disaster in the city of Malang. At least 135 people died at a top-tier football match after — against FIFA security policy — police fired tear gas inside the stadium setting off panic and a chaotic scramble for the exits.
""FIFA was damning in its concerns toward Indonesia's football association for not dealing with security very well, and that cost them credibility,"" said Chong.
""The Kanjuruhan tragedy is the worst drama in the history of Indonesian football,"" said football analyst Hardimen Koto. ""But Indonesian football should not be trapped around that. It must be changed. It must move forward.""
In the wake of the tragedy, Indonesian officials were hoping the Under-20 World Cup would help repair some of the damage done to the nation's football reputation. Instead, it's the Under-17 tournament that the country hopes will have a lasting impact.
""Dozens of Ministries are involved with the organization. Indonesia wants to be successful as a host,"" said Hardimen.
Since the host country is also given one of the 24 places in the tournament, politicians, organizers and fans would love to see a strong showing by the home team. It is the first World Cup appearance for Indonesia at any level since 1938.
The side, which includes Frankfurt-born Hoffenheim youth player Amar Brkic, had to hurriedly prepare for world-class competition. They spent an intensive month training in Germany ahead of their opening game versus Ecuador and hope to benefit from the guidance of newly appointed technical director Frank Wormuth, Germany's former chief coaching instructor.
“We hope that the players can perform to their best,"" said head coach Bima Sakti. ""And ask for support from football-loving fans and those watching on television.""

https://www.dw.com/en/how-the-climate-crisis-is-affecting-elite-sport/a-67343583,SPORTS,How the climate crisis is affecting elite sport 08.11.2023,"The view from the Arun Jaitley Stadium in the heart of Delhi is milky. On the field, Bangladesh are on their way to beating Sri Lanka at the Cricket World Cup, but these players are not to be envied. The air quality is so bad that training sessions before the match had been canceled. The air quality index in Delhi has been moving between unhealthy and hazardous in recent days, so much so that outdoor activities are not currently recommended because of possible health issues.
A blow for India's Olympic hopes
Smog is the result of pollution from power plants, vehicles and other sources reacting in sunlight and heat and is both aggravates by and contributes to the rising temperatures that accompany climate change.
The cricket stars currently in India are having to contend with this, breathing in particularly harmful particulate matter - the term for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. 
Some of these particles are so small they can get deep into your lungs, some even into your bloodstream. Particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, also known as fine particles or PM2.5, pose the greatest risk to health and in Delhi the current PM2.5 reading is 184 micrograms per cubic meter, 12 times the limit set by the World Health Organization.
With air purifiers in the dressing rooms and water misting alongside the pitch, the organizers are trying to alleviate the problems at the World Cup matches.
""In an ideal world, you don't want a situation like this,"" India captain Rohit Sharma said. ""But I'm pretty sure the concerned people are taking the necessary steps to avoid these kind of situations. It's not ideal, everyone knows that.""
The problems at the Cricket World Cup are also not good news for India's image as an up-and-coming sporting nation that wants to host the 2036 Olympic Games. The images of a smog-ridden Delhi certainly don't help that cause.
It's becoming increasingly common to see elite sport affected by environmental and climate changes, the author David Goldblatt told DW.
""The Australian Open, which was played in a heat wave, you had like a thousand people being treated for heat issues,"" Goldblatt said. ""As you know, Tokyo 2020, we had outdoor swimmers swimming in really health-threatening 30-degree (86 F) water. One of these events is going to be cataclysmic.""
Goldblatt is the co-founder of Football for Future, an organization that challenges football's stakeholders to respond to the changing world. He believes that sport will have to change, replacing relentless growth with reduction.
""The bigger question is really over the next kind of 20 years; global sport as a whole and domestic sports have got to think very, very hard about: Can we keep growing? Maybe we need to actually do less,"" Goldblatt said.
The battle between more and less is currently most apparent in skiing, the sport that has perhaps been the most affected by the climate crisis. While the the sport's international governing body seeks to expand the current World Cup calendar, criticism is growing louder.
""We cannot deny climate change and must adapt,"" said Christian Scherer, the general secretary of Austria's skiing association.
Factors such as snow safety and sustainability efforts such as using existing facilities will play a central role in the future when awarding major events to locations. The same applies to heat conditions and air quality as is now the case in India.
Sport is not just a victim of the climate crisis. From amateur athletes getting in the car several times a week for training and competitions to major events such as the Olympics, sport is also an offender when it comes to the environment.
""It's symbolically insane,"" Goldblatt said of the 2030 World Cup. As a football fan, he sympathizes with opening the tournament in Uruguay, but said a tournament with 105 matches on three continents, with tens of thousands of fans traveling back and forth, was a farce from an environmental point of view. Although sports associations such as the International Olympic Committee and FIFA are making efforts to label their events as ""climate-friendly"" or even ""climate-neutral"" by paying for CO2 compensation programs, Goldblatt said, this is ""not a plausible plan.""
Ironically, both FIFA and the IOC have committed to more climate protection as part of the World Climate Conference. The declared goal of the sports action plan: Greenhouse gas emissions are to be halved by 2030 and reduced to zero by 2040. Further talks are scheduled for the upcoming COP 28 world climate summit in Dubai at the end of November.
Cricket's governing body has not yet signed up to the UN's action plan but has set its own sustainability goals. The smog-ridden World Cup shows how necessary it is for sport to be a role model in environmental protection. Prominent voices from sport itself are therefore needed, Goldblatt said.
""We need a Marcus Rashford,"" he said. ""We need all of those folks, men and women in football and in cricket. Where is the Indian cricketer who's going to stand up? And they would have a major voice in Indian politics.""
There are athletes who have stood up. Australia's cricket captain, Pat Cummins, has been vocal about the climate impact on cricket and worked with Australian cricket to ensure that the association is doing its part for the climate. Otherwise, Cummins said, it'll soon be ""game over for the sport we love.""

https://www.dw.com/en/shakhtar-donetsk-our-game-can-bring-joy-to-people/a-67333468,SOCCER,Shakhtar Donetsk: 'Our game can bring joy to people' 07.11.2023,"The wind whistles through the catacombs of the Volksparkstadion, the home ground of German second-division club Hamburger SV. Shakhtar Donetsk train under the floodlights – and the keen eye of their recently appointed head coach, Marino Pusic.
This is where the team from Ukraine's eastern Donbas region are playing their home Champions League matches this season, the latest being a sensational 1-0 victory over European giants Barcelona on November 7.
Playing home games on the road is nothing new for Shakhtar. Ever since Donetsk was occupied by pro-Russian separatists in 2014, Ukraine's most famous club has not been able to play in its home stadium, Donbass Arena.
""It's a lot of traveling and took us many hours to reach our destination,"" Pusic said, referring to the distance between Hamburg and the Ukrainian capital, where they faced Dynamo Kyiv in a league match last Friday.
""You can't call it a home game,"" he stressed.
Their real home, Donetsk, is even farther away from Hamburg – about 2,500 kilometers (1,553 miles) away. Despite the distance, the players feel that their hometown still identifies with their team.
""Although we haven't played in Donetsk since 2014, we are still a team from Donetsk, in other words, from Donbas. And we represent this region in Ukraine,"" midfielder Taras Stepanenko told DW.
""The spirit of this city, this region, is unbreakable. It lives in this team, even though the city and the region have been occupied by Russian troops since 2014.""
At 34, Stepanenko is one of Shaktar's veterans, having joined the club in 2010.
""At the beginning, it was difficult to get used to playing without fans, without support. We were used to around 25,000 people attending Shakhtar matches in Donetsk. It was a like holiday for them,"" Stepanenko said.
Donbass Arena hasn't seen football since Russia's illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014. Since Russia's full-scale invasion last year, Shakhtar haven't been able to play European matches anywhere else in Ukraine either.
Russia's military aggression has turned Shaktar into a nomadic team. Until 2017, they played their home matches in Lviv, Ukraine, around 1,200 kilometers west of Donetsk, before moving to Kharkiv, around 300 kilometers away, before then relocating to Kyiv, where most of the players already lived and trained.
At first, they played their Europa League and Champions League matches in the Polish capital, Warsaw, before moving to Hamburg this year, their fifth ""home ground.""
While football remains important to Shakhtar's players, their thoughts are with people back home, where the war is ever-present.
""Sometimes you feel sad, sometimes desperate, sometimes you don't understand why it's happening in your own country. You just have to get used to it and be strong,"" Stepanenko said.
Many friends and relatives still live in the occupied regions of Ukraine. And the players are in constant contact with the people there.
""Sometimes you forget about football and which opponent is particularly strong with which foot. Because you don't care about that,"" Stepanenko explained. ""It's more important what happens to the people in Ukraine.""
Dealing with the current situation is also a challenge for their new coach, Marino Pusic, who has been particularly impressed by the cohesion of his team.
""It's not easy, but I see and feel a fighting spirit throughout the club, everyone is working hard and they're like a family. They support each other.""
Despite the circumstances, the team is determined to perform at their best on the pitch.
""It's our duty to play football and try to achieve good results. People in Europe and the world should remember that there is Ukraine, which needs help,"" Stepanenko stressed. ""And we have to get this message across through sport.""
His teammate, 21-year-old Georgiy Sudakov, told DW that thoughts of the war could actually be motivating because ""when the whole country is watching you, many people are rooting for you, and through our game we can bring joy to people in this difficult time and convey positive feelings to them.""
By beating Barcelona, Shakhtar not only improved their chances of making the knockout stages of the Champions League but took full advantage of the opportunity to raise awareness of Ukraine's plight.

https://www.dw.com/en/report-saudi-arabia-atp-talks-could-change-mens-tennis/a-67331699,SPORTS,Report: Saudi Arabia-ATP talks could change men's tennis 07.11.2023,"The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP)  is reportedly in discussions with Saudi Arabia to engineer a dramatic change to the start of the men's tennis season.
According to British newspaper, The Times, Saudi Arabia is keen to host a new Masters 1000 tournament just a week before the Australian Open. It would likely have a profound impact on the first Grand Slam of the year.
Masters series events are considered the second-most important tier of tournaments behind theGrand Slam  majors. A new January Masters event would undoubtedly see warm-up tournaments in Australia lose most of the top names in men's tennis, and much of their ability to draw fans as a result.
If confirmed, the tournament would push the top men's players into an event in Riyadh that would finish just eight days before the start of the major in Melbourne, 12,000 kilometers and eight time zones away.
The ATP tour schedule is already a full 11 months, kicking off with the United Cup, a combined men's and women's team event in Australia before leading up to the late January start of the Australian Open.
But a proposed investment from Saudi Arabia ""would be worth hundreds of millions of pounds"", reports The Times, with the Riyadh tournament suggested to start in January 2025. 
Saudi Arabia""s Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth fund which has invested heavily in numerous professional sports including football, golf, Formula One, boxing and cricket, has also got previous history with tennis.
Tennis great Billie Jean King said she expects the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) to give in to Saudi offers but hopes the WTA will push for social change as part of its dealmaking.
After a much-criticized WTA Finals recently wrapped up in Cancun, Mexico, talk is said to have stepped up regarding moving the finals to Saudi Arabia in coming years. The WTA Finals is the most significant event in the women's game outside of the four majors.
WTA CEO Steve Simon has said that Saudi Arabia presented ""big issues"" as a host for women's tour events, because Saudi Arabia's record on women's and LGBTQ rights has led to accusations of sportswashing — that is, money spent on sports teams, athletes and events that is meant to distract attention from Saudi Arabia's human rights abuses. 
The ATP has declined to comment on the reports by The Times, but chairman Andrea Gaudenzi confirmed he held ""positive” discussions with Saudi officials this year about a partnership.
The ATP's end-of-season Next Gen Finals tournament for players aged 21 and under is set for next month in Jeddah, and is part of a deal that will run for five years. The Times also reports that ATP and Saudi representatives will meet at next week's ATP Finals in Turin.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-grassroots-football-working-toward-trans-inclusion/a-67328671,SOCCER,Germany: Grassroots football working toward trans inclusion 07.11.2023,"The World Aquatics open-gender category at last month's swimming World Cup in Berlin was described as a ""pilot project"" aimed at highlighting the organization's ""unwavering commitment to inclusivity.""
However, the project fell flat as not a single athlete registered to compete in the new category – an outcome that some had already foreseen.
""We had criticized the introduction of this category in advance. The fact that no one came forward is understandable and was no surprise to us,"" Mara Geri, a board member of the Lesbian and Gay Association in Germany (LSVD), told DW.
""There aren't that many professional athletes in swimming. To then register as a trans person in a separate group like that borders on a forced coming out,"" Geri added.
""This makes trans people second-class people who don't really belong. In our opinion, this is certainly not inclusion, but a huge step toward exclusion.""
It's not just high-performance sports where transgender people feel excluded or even isolated. In the first comprehensive European survey of LGBTQ athletes conducted by the German Sport University Cologne in 2019, 20% of respondents stated that they did not participate in their chosen sport for fear of discrimination, exclusion or negative comments. The survey found that 56% of trans people and 73% of trans men felt excluded from certain sports due to their gender identity. Almost all of the respondents agreed that homophobia and transphobia are a problem in sport.
The Berlin Football Association (BFV) broke new ground back in 2019, by becoming one of the first sports organizations in Germany to establish inclusive rules. There, people who identify as non-binary are free to choose whether they want play with the men or the women. In addition, trans people are automatically eligible to play for the team they choose during gender transition.
""You have to make a distinction. We have people who play in amateur leagues and those who just play,"" Michaela Jessica Tschitschke, who was recently appointed as the BFV's advisor on sexual diversity told DW.
According to Tschitschke, a 43-year-old trans woman who plays and coaches at a women's team in Berlin, around 15 trans people are currently getting involved on the city's football pitches.
""These people mainly play in women's teams. They (women) are usually more open to trans people,"" said Tschitschke. 
In Tschitschke's experience, trans men who want to play on men's teams have a much more difficult time gaining acceptance.
""Unfortunately, most of them then give up. That's a shame because we've often supported these people for a long time.""
Even if the trans person is fully accepted by their own team, they often still face prejudice from opposing teams, Tschitschke said.
""Then problems arise. Unfortunately, it's usually about the assumption that they are at an advantage in terms of their performance.""
Last year, the German Football Association (DFB) amended its match regulations to include the Berlin inclusion rules.
""Some regional associations have already implemented them. In others, things remain stalled,"" Tschitschke said.
While the total number of people affected still may be quite small, Tschitschke is upbeat. ""We have already made some changes.""

https://www.dw.com/en/russia-appeals-olympics-suspension-to-international-court/a-67319026,SPORTS,Russia appeals Olympics suspension to international court 06.11.2023,"The Russian Olympic Committee has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport concerning its suspension by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) last month, the court said on Monday.
The IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) for violating the territorial integrity of the membership of Ukraine by incorporating sports councils in illegally-annexed territories of Ukraine, including Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia. 
The IOC said on October 12 the Russian move ""constitutes a breach of the Olympic Charter because it violates the territorial integrity of the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine.""
The ROC made a similar move in 2016 to incorporate sports entities in the Crimea region, which had been annexed by Russia two years earlier. The IOC did not issue a suspension at that time.
The suspension removes the right of the ROC to get a share of Olympic broadcast and sponsor money worth millions of dollars in each four-year Olympic funding cycle. Russian officials have reportedly been weighing legal action to access the money not being paid due to economic sanctions imposed following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport said Monday the Russian appeal asks for the ROC to be reinstated ""benefiting from all rights and prerogatives granted by the Olympic Charter.""
It's unclear if the legal dispute will have an effect on Russian athletes hoping to compete at the 2024 Paris Olympics.
The IOC has previously said any Russian athletes accepted as ""neutral"" individuals to compete in Paris could be invited directly via their sport's world governing body in a process bypassing the ROC, but a final decision on neutral athletes competing will be taken ""at the appropriate time,"" the IOC said.
In terms of the current legal dispute, Court of Arbitration for Sport said ""it is not possible to indicate a time frame"" for a verdict by its panel of judges. However, a hearing is likely to be held in Lausanne, Switzerland, which is home to both the court and the IOC.

https://www.dw.com/en/gay-games-in-hong-kong-guadalajara-what-you-need-to-know/a-67311150,SPORTS,"Gay Games in Hong Kong, Guadalajara: What you need to know 05.11.2023","The Gay Games is an international multisport event organized every four years by the Federation of Gay Games (FGG).
In its statement of concept and purpose, the FGG says it aims ""to foster and augment the self-respect of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and all sexually-fluid or gender-variant individuals (LGBT+) throughout the world and to promote respect and understanding from others, primarily by organizing and administering the international quadrennial sport and cultural event known as the 'Gay Games.'""
The organizers claim the Gay Games is ""the world's largest inclusive sports, art and culture event"" which stands for ""unity in diversity.""

The brainchild of former US Olympian Tom Waddell and other homosexual athletes, the inaugural Gay Games took place in San Francisco in 1982. Since then, the United States have hosted the Games on four more occasions (San Francisco in 1986, New York in 1994, Chicago in 2006 and Cleveland/Akron in 2014).
They first went abroad to Vancouver in 1990, and left North America for the first time in 1998 when they were hosted by Amsterdam. Other European cities to have hosted the Gay Games are Cologne (2010) and Paris (2018), while Sydney hosted the 2002 Games. The 2026 Games will take place in Valencia, Spain.
The current 11th edition of the Gay Games was originally scheduled for November 2022 in Hong Kong, but it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They are now taking place from November 3-11 with Guadalajara, the second-biggest city in Mexico, added as a co-host.
It is the first time that the Gay Games will be held in Asia and Latin America, and indeed across two continents.
Sports events at the Gay Games are divided into seven general categories: ball games, racquet sports, sea sports, running, mat sports, swimming and table sports.
Within these categories are subcategories including specific sports such as fencing and martial arts, tennis, table tennis, badminton and squash.
Sixteen sports will take place in Hong Kong, while 21 will take place in Guadalajara. Many will take place in both locations.
""This is a huge chance for us,"" said Mexican transgender footballer Noemi Arzate, speaking to DW from her home in Mexico City. ""Firstly, to test ourselves in international competition, and secondly to discover other cultures, meet new people and make new friends.""
Arzate said she never imagined such an international competition taking place since ""so many things were blocked"" for her in the past.
""Imagine what it means to have such a huge event as the Gay Games to make us visible,"" she said. ""It's a great thing to make trans women more visible in sport and take part in this competition.""
The influence of China on Hong Kong has led to restrictions on the rights of LGBTQ+ people in the financial enclave on the South China Sea in recent years.
Same-sex relationships are legal, and a recent judgement from the Supreme Court did guarantee certain rights for same-sex couples.
However, same-sex marriage is not permitted with equal rights and there are no specific anti-discrimination laws for the protection of the LGBTQ+ community in Hong Kong, where there have been massive protests against the government in recent years.
The awarding of the Games to Hong Kong has therefore drawn criticism, but organizers say they hope the Games and their message of inclusivity can help improve the situation both in Hong Kong and across Asia generally.
""We believe that hosting the Games for the very first time here will be a momentous experience and a cornerstone for our Asian community as well as for the whole world. GGHK can bring all of us together in the name of Sport, Fairness, Respect and Friendship,"" reads the official website.
The organizers estimate that 221 million LGBTQ+ people live in Asia, ""a region where there is an ongoing struggle to overcome homophobia and [gain] acceptance.""
The Gay Games aren't limited to homosexual athletes; straight athletes can also take part.
""Everyone aged 18+ is welcome to participate regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity or even training level,"" the website states under the motto: ""Games for all!""
With no restrictions in place and no qualifications required, over 2,000 participants from 45 different countries are expected in each location.

https://www.dw.com/en/israel-hamas-and-freedom-of-speech-in-german-football/a-67284806,SPORTS,"Israel, Hamas and freedom of speech in German football 02.11.2023","""Every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his/her opinions in speech, writing and pictures and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources. Freedom of the press and freedom of reporting by means of broadcasts and films shall be guaranteed. There shall be no censorship.""
These are the words of Article 5 of the German Basic Law, which then clarifies: ""These rights shall find their limits in the provisions of general laws, in provisions for the protection of young persons and in the right to personal honor.""
In other words, everyone can say what they want, as long as they do not insult or defame anyone or incite crime, hatred or violence.
So much for the basically clear legal situation. Far less clear and unambiguous, however, are the interpretation and understanding of how someone might have meant something, and whether a statement or social media post actually has criminal content.
In recent weeks, several Bundesliga footballers have found themselves in the eye of the storm.
Noussair Mazraoui, a Moroccan international who plays for Bayern Munich, had wished ""victory to Palestine"" in a social media post.
Anwar El Ghazi, a Dutchman with Moroccan roots playing for Mainz, caused a bigger stir with posts on social media including the slogan: ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.""
The phrase refers to the belief that a Palestinian state should stretch from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, thereby denying Israel's right to exist.
Mainz officials initially suspended the 28-year-old, saying his posts were not compatible with the values of the club, only to lift the suspension on Monday this week after holding talks with the player.
""El Ghazi has since distanced himself from his post on his Instagram account, which he deleted minutes later, in multiple conversations with the club,"" a club statement read.
""He regrets publishing the post and was remorseful about its negative impact. El Ghazi explicitly distanced himself from terrorist acts such as those committed by Hamas two weeks ago. He expressed his condolences to the victims of the attack and to all the victims of the ongoing conflict. He also stated that he does not question Israel’s right to exist.""
On Wednesday morning, however, El Ghazi doubled down, disputing the statements and apologies attributed to him by the club as ""not factually correct"" and ""not authorised.""
""I do not regret my position and have no remorse. I am not distancing myself from what I said,"" El Ghazi said. He added: ""I will stand until my last breath for humanity and the oppressed.""
Much to the ""surprise and incomprehension"" of his club. Mainz announced its intention to ""legally examine and then evaluate"" the matter. Speaking after Mainz's 0-3 cup defeat to second-division Hertha Berlin on Wednesday night, club sporting director Martin Schmidt said that the issue would now be discussed ""at board level.""
""We're going to put our heads together and come up with a solution as soon as possible. We'll give a statement in the next couple of days.""
But El Ghazi's comments have put Mainz in a precarious legal position. His suspension could be challenged under labor laws and any attempt to remove the player from his contract or request him to make no further comment on the matter, would put them on thin legal ice.
""Everyone has a right to privacy, and the employer basically has no way of influencing an employee's expression of opinion or actions outside of his or her working hours,"" explained Paul Lambertz, a specialist lawyer for sports law.
When Lambertz made this statement to various media last month, it created a stir on social media, with some politicians, including member of the Bundestag for the conservative opposition CDU Johannes Steiniger, who demanded that, in the case of Mazraoui, he should not only be kicked out of Bayern Munich but that deportation from Germany should also be considered — a demand has no legal basis.
""As a rule, I can only deport if there is a right of residence, if crimes of considerable importance are committed,"" Bavaria's home secretary Joachim Herrmann of the CSU told Bayerischer Rundfunk. ""Bayern has to take care of this itself.""
That's what the club did by not imposing sanctions on the player and simply announcing that they had spoken with Mazraouri and confirmed that he is a ""peaceful person.""
To have gone any further would have risked a legal challenge.
Alon Meyer, president of Makkabi Deutschland, the Jewish gymnastics and sports association in Germany, praised Mainz's initial suspension of El Ghazi but expressed strong disagreement with Bayern's decision. 
Bayern's reaction was ""absolutely out of the question and unacceptable for anyone who even remotely respects our society,"" Meyer told German public broadcaster ZDF. ""If you take a unilateral position and wish the Palestinians victory — victory over what? — that is absolutely antisemitic.""
Meyer described Bayern's handling of the situation as inadequate. ""At no point was the massacre mentioned or condolences expressed. At no point is the state of Israel mentioned – maybe because [Mazaoui] doesn't recognize it — and at no point, and this is crucial, is there any hint of an apology. And Hamas is not condemned either.""
German football wanted to set a sign ""for peace"" and there have been minute's silences at football stadiums across the country to condemn the violence and loss of life. In Freiburg, the stadium announcer said that ""all people who have become victims should be remembered"" while Union Berlin announced that ""the victims of terror and war will be remembered"" without explicitly mentioning Israel or Hamas.
Hamas is considered a terrorist group by the US, the EU, Germany, and many others.

https://www.dw.com/en/nfl-kansas-city-chiefs-return-to-germany-33-years-later/a-67273317,SPORTS,NFL: Kansas City Chiefs return to Germany 33 years later 02.11.2023,"Over 50,000 fans in Frankfurt enjoyed themselves as the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Miami Dolphins 21-14 in the first of two games in Germany this November. For Chiefs' star quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the visit was a first, but for the NFL team that has won two of the last four Super Bowls the trip to Germany marked an historic return.
In August 1990, between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the official reunification of Germany, the Chiefs played the Los Angeles Rams in the Olympiastadion in West Berlin.
It was the ninth edition of the now defunct pre-season international series called the American Bowl and the first ever NFL game in Germany. The game was originally supposed to take place in Frankfurt, the western city with a far larger US business and military presence, but the historic political developments forced a change of plan.
""We decided to do the game here after the political events developed so quickly,"" NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue told the LA Times at the time. ""Everyone urged us to do it in Berlin as a way of celebrating the freedom that came to Central Europe in the last year.""
The Chiefs lost that first ever game in Germany 19-3 to the Rams, but for those of the 55,429 fans in attendance who weren't American service personnel who had been given free tickets and trips from various military bases across Europe, this was about much more than just watching a confusing, new sport.
Cheerleaders, tailgating and the Beach Boys being played on the tannoy system offered a chance to sample American life, especially for those who, just months before, had been on the other side of the Iron Curtain.
Indeed, German journalist Irina Prass, who had grown up in East Berlin and went on to become the editor-in-chief of the Berliner Zeitung, is quoted in The Washington Post at the time as saying: ""I'm totally blown away. Such a spectacle. So many things. So American.""
Christian Okoye played just four minutes that day, as is customary for starters during preseason, but the Nigerian running back remembers it well.
""I don't think they [the fans] quite understood it but they were excited the game was there,"" Okoye tells DW.
""It was such a different time. The Wall had just came down and there was a big buzz about that. We all took home souvenirs, pieces of the Wall. I remember coming home with a Soviet officers hat.""
Okoye's NFL story is a fairytale. Originally a discus thrower, among other disciplines, he was surprisingly left out of the Nigerian track and field team for the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles.
Okoye turned to American football, and, despite having never played the game before he was 23, the running back arrived in Berlin off the back of an NFL-best 12-touchdown, 1,480-yard season.
The man nicknamed ""the Nigerian nightmare"" was truly a pioneer for African players. Now a Chiefs' ambassador, he still gets calls today from players coming through from Nigeria and other African nations thanking him for opening the door.
Beyond bringing American football to Germany, Okoye also took great pride in playing in the Olympiastadion.
""The most important thing for me, because of my track and field background, was remembering Jesse Owens won four golds in that stadium,"" Okoye says. 
""It was an historic moment to play where Owens set all those records and where Hitler was in the stands when he did. It was one of the moments I took with me forever.""
Okoye famously said at the game in Berlin that it would take many years for American football to establish itself in Germany.
Today, however, every NFL team has played at least one game internationally since 2011, and Europe's largest economy is a logical match for the world's most lucrative sports league in the world.
Thanks to NFL Europe and a long-lasting domestic league, Germany's NFL fan base has always been a sleeping giant.
Last year, Brett Gosper, NFL Head of Europe, told The Associated Press (AP) that Germany had more casual fans (17 million) than the UK. That number has only risen in the last 12 months, with tickets for the Chiefs vs. Dolphins game selling out in just 15 minutes.
The NFL has grown too. The league's revenue in 1990 was reportedly around $1.3 billion (although that was disputed at the time as being less than the real number). Today, Sportico reports that the league's revenue is roughly $19 billion.
Chiefs President Mark Donovan told AP the team has spent $1 million on preparation and fan events for the game in Frankfurt, including a Chiefs-themed boat on the Main river where fans can take a selfie with the Super Bowl trophy.
This may seem a lot, but looking at the numbers from last year's game between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Seattle Seahawks in Munich, the Chiefs investment is no surprise. Nearly 70,000 fans attended and fan merchandise sales on game day at the Allianz Arena stadium were reportedly the highest ever for an NFL game outside of the US.
The Chiefs will also hope their visit boosted their social media following, boasting the fastest-growing Instagram and TikTok engagement of any NFL team in Germany.
Much may have changed since that pivotal game in Berlin in 1990, but it's still success on the field that counts, and that's what's made the Chiefs one of the most popular US sports teams in the world.
""When you win and you're doing good, people love you, and we have the best quarterback in the world,"" Okoye says, referring to Mahomes. ""What's not to like about the Chiefs?""
With Mahomes delivering another victory in Frankfurt in front of a majority Chiefs-fan crowd, it was clear winning games really is the best way to win hearts.

https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-habeck-warns-antisemitism-bears-consequences/a-67281958,POLITICS,Germany's Habeck warns antisemitism bears consequences 02.11.2023,"
German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck has spoken out emphatically about antisemitism in Germany — and, in particular, an uptick in hate crimes since the Israel-Hamas war began.
In a video posted online, the Green Party politician also warned that there would be consequences for those who exhibit antisemitic hatred.
Habeck defended Israel's security as an integral part of Germany's existence as a nation and sharply criticized antisemitic tendencies among some Muslims, right-wing extremists and left-wing activists.
He said Germany's responsibility for the Holocaust meant it was essential that Jews should be able to live ""freely and safely in Germany, that they never again have to be afraid to openly show their religion and their culture. But it is precisely this fear that is back.""
""Jewish communities warn their members to avoid certain places for their own safety. And this is the reality here today, in Germany, almost 80 years after the Holocaust,"" said Habeck.
He spoke of ""painful"" conversations with Frankfurt's Jewish community, in which he learned that children were now afraid to go to school and sports clubs or to display their religious affiliation by, for example, wearing the Star of David necklace.
Habeck, who in addition to being vice chancellor is also minister for economic affairs and climate action, said there should be severe consequences for antisemitic acts, particularly for supporters of the radical Islamist militant group Hamas in Germany.
Later on Thursday, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser announced a ban on activities by or supporting Hamas and another pro-Palestinian organization accused of antisemitism.
Habeck said the burning of Israeli flags during demonstrations and ""praising Hamas terror"" were criminal offenses. 
""Any German citizen who does this will have to answer for such offenses in court. Those who are not German cititzens will also risk their residency status,"" said Habeck. ""Anyone who does not yet have a residence permit will have provided a reason to be deported.""

He appealed to Muslim associations to ""clearly distance themselves from antisemitism so as not to undermine their own right to tolerance.""
The Central Council of Jews in Germany President, Josef Schuster, welcomed the video statement, praising it for a ""clear commitment to German reason of state,"" — a term that expresses Germany's commitment to Israel as a fundamental part of Germany's very present-day existence — and for ""showing the consequences for those who do not want to accept it.""
A survey by a civil society observatory Report Antisemitism found a 240% year-on-year increase in antisemitic incidents in the period from October 7, when Hamas launched its terror attack on Israel, to October 15.

https://www.dw.com/en/the-princess-at-the-center-of-saudi-arabias-sporting-web/a-67274734,SPORTS,The princess at the center of Saudi Arabia's sporting web 01.11.2023,"After Australia became the latest country to withdraw their candidacy, Saudi Arabia will host the men's football World Cup in 2034 without vote or opposition.
The decision was the cherry on top of a cake of a month which has also seen Al Nassr's Cristiano Ronaldo watch heavyweight boxer Tyson Fury beat Francis Ngannou in Riyadh and Saudi-owned Newcastle United beat Qatari-owned Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League.
In November, the logo of state-owned Saudi oil company Aramco will be all over the Cricket World Cup final in Ahmedabad, India, just as it is in every Formula One race from Australia to Azerbaijan, and in dozens of other high profile sporting events across the globe – from wrestling to horse racing, and eSports to sailing. That's not to mention LIV golf.
Indeed, data provided to DW from Danish initiative, Play the Game, whose stated aim is to promote ""democracy, transparency, and freedom of expression in world sport,"" reveals that Aramco currently have at least 26 sporting sponsorships.
Only Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth fund which owns Newcastle and boasts 137 sponsorships either directly or via its subsidiaries, has a greater chunk of the total 323 Saudi sponsorships in sport identified in the detailed analysis.
Both Aramco and PIF are state-owned. This muddying of the waters between state and sport is further polluted by a number of key individuals who wield enormous diplomatic and political power on one hand, while casting significant sporting influence with the other.
Princess Reema bint Bandar Al-Saud is one of those people. A member of the ruling Saudi royal family, Princess Reema also holds four official, high-ranking titles within sport, according to Play the Game's research.
""She projects Saudi Arabia in the image that [Crown Prince] Mohammed bin Salman wants Saudi Arabia to be projected,"" James Dorsey, Senior Fellow at the National University of Singapore's Middle East Institute and author of 'The Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer,' tells DW.
""That is: more forward-looking, socially-liberal, granting women opportunities, and so on. She's achieving that, and is the perfect candidate.""
Her roles also include being Saudi Arabia's first female ambassador to the US, a place on the board of the Saudi Olympic Committee — and as chair the women’s committee — and a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), with many observers believing the Olympics to be Saudi Arabia's next sporting target.
""This type of formal relationship between a leader of a National Olympic Committee (NOC) and a national government raises critical questions about conflicts of interest, questions of allegiance, and the so-called autonomy of sport that the Olympic movement so ardently promotes,"" says Stanis Elsborg of Play the Game.
""Will she be willing and able to effectively uphold the autonomy of the NOC as a politician and government representative if a situation arises where the interests of the Saudi government and those of the Olympic movement diverge politically?""
While the IOC would not facilitate a DW request for an interview with Princess Reema, the organization sent a statement which said that all their members meet the criteria applied to them.
It also pointed out that ""no actual or potential conflict of interest situation has been noted so far"" since the inception of an internal ""electronic tool"" in 2020, adding that should any conflicts arise, they would be dealt with by ""the CECO [Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer], and fully disclosed to the IOC Executive Board.""
However, the IOC's own Charter states that members must ""act independently of commercial and political interests as well as any racial or religious consideration.""
Maintaining distance from political interests appears to be the most delicate of balancing acts for Princess Reema.
The 48-year-old is the daughter of Bandar bin Sultan Al-Saud, who was also — among other high-ranking intelligence and security posts — Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the US, and Haifa bint Faisal Al-Saud, the daughter of a Saudi King (and Prime Minister) and Queen.
Princess Reema is also, therefore, the great-granddaughter of Ibn Saud, regarded as the founder of modern Saudi Arabia, on both paternal and maternal sides.
Her father's work in the USA saw the princess, one of eight children, educated in the States, graduating from George Washington University with a degree in museum studies.
Before she made her impact in sport, the princess had worked in high end retail and was praised for social enterprises that were often purported to offer greater chances to women in a country widely accepted to have a poor record on women's rights.
In the past, the princess has pointed to the admission of women in to some football stadiums as a sign of progress.

""We are working with all of the [Saudi Arabian sports] Federations to include women, not just as athletes, but also on the board level, advisory level and in the administration,"" the princess told ESPN in a rare interview in 2018.
""In our community we're not yet used to gender integration, and it's going to come, but we need to look out for ourselves. Appointing women to look out for other women is critical. And it expands job opportunities.""
While acknowledging that Saudi Arabia was ""one of the most repressive regimes in the region,"" author and academic James Dorsey says that the situation is improving for women.
""Whatever one thinks of Mohammed bin Salman, the fact of the matter is that he has significantly enhanced women's social rights, as well as opportunity for women. You see a lot more women prominently in government and private sector positions.""
Nevertheless, none have quite the reach of Princess Reema, whose family background has allowed her troubling access and power, says Stanis Elsborg of Play the Game, who perceives a conflict of interests.
""Her roles allow Saudi Arabia to engage in sports diplomacy, cultivate international relationships, establish new diplomatic ties, and shape its image on the global sports scene.""
For Dorsey, however, that conflict is a byproduct of the way the country operates.
""Let's face it, all of these ruling families are corrupt by definition. They became wealthy by corruption. There was no distinction between the state budget and their budget,"" he says. ""In other words, the concept of conflict of interest doesn't exist.""
While Princess Reema's high-powered roles may look inspiring to women in Saudi Arabia, or polish the image of the state in the eyes of individuals, states or sporting institutions abroad, the chances of any woman not born into the royal lineage ascending to that type of power seem slim.
While there are pockets of misgiving about the way the likes of the Princess Reema, Yasir Al-Rumayyan and Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Saud operate, there's no doubt that it's effective.
The World Cup announcement by FIFA President and Princess Reema's IOC colleague, Gianni Infantino, was proof of that in more ways than one.

https://www.dw.com/en/antisemitism-in-sport-new-report-button-will-help/a-67274207,SPORTS,Antisemitism in sport: new 'report button' will help 01.11.2023,"Even before the brutal terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel, there have been increasing reports of antisemitic attacks in sport in Germany.
Amateur football, which is the largest popular sport with about 2.2 million active players, is a particular issue for Jewish people who are affected time and again. The number of cases known to the public is presumed many times higher than the number of unreported cases because many suspected cases are not reported at all and are therefore not made public.
A new possibility to centrally record antisemitic assaults in sport should change all that. A report button has been developed that makes it easier for clubs, associations and fan organizations to address such incidents. The RIAS (Federal Association of Research and Information Centres on Antisemitism), which launched the ""Zusammen1"" project in cooperation with the Jewish sports federation Makkabi Germany, wants to use this to combat the ""grievance in dealing with experiences of discrimination in sport"". Antisemitic incidents in sport can now be reported on this website.
RIAS Managing Director Benjamin Steinitz spoke of a ""milestone in the fight against antisemitism"" at the presentation of the button in Borussia Dortmund's stadium. Steinitz also referred to the ""noticeable increase in antisemitic incidents in response to the Hamas attacks"" and stressed that it was important to make antisemitism visible.
""The findings from the reports will help in the area of restrictions, but especially in the area of even more targeted antisemitism prevention,"" the antisemitism commissioner of North Rhine-Westphalia, Sabine Leutheuser-Schnarrenberger, informed DW. She said that ""as antisemitism commissioner, she is in close exchange with RIAS, both at federal and state level."" The project is enormously important because ""no exact figures are available for the entire sports sector.""
Maccabi President Alon Meyer said the situation had ""taken on dramatic features"", which also affected the approximately 40 Jewish sports clubs in Germany. ""Some local clubs had to partially or completely stop playing,"" Meyer said.
The report button creators referred to a study from 2021, according to which 83% of incidents are still discussed in private, but only 54% are reported to clubs. Thirty-eight per cent of the cases reach the offices of organized sport and only 24% reach the non-sport reporting offices. The button is intended to remedy this situation and, according to the initiators, make it easier to ""integrate the reporting function in a low-threshold manner on all websites.""
By clicking on the button, reports of antisemitic attacks can be submitted anonymously. These are then automatically and securely forwarded to RIAS for processing and analysis. The report button can be embedded via code on any website, which should continuously increase visibility and awareness, and therefore also the number of reported cases.
""The new reporting structures with the sports reporting button are an important step towards shedding light on the dark field of antisemitic incidents in sports and, in particular, simplifying reporting,"" Leutheuser-Schnarrenberger told DW.

In principle, the reporting persons can decide for themselves how to proceed with cases reported to RIAS. Criminal prosecution, for example, does not necessarily follow a reported case. First and foremost, it is about the central recording of antisemitic incidents in sport, as is also the case with the general reporting website report-antisemitism.de operated by RIAS. ""Verified incidents are systematised and evaluated,"" the website says, and with ""consent, the incident is published in our timeline.""
Non-Jewish athletes who are active in Maccabi clubs and even form the majority in those clubs are also repeatedly affected by antisemitic hostility as Maccabi members. The report button is also designed for them.
The aim is to ""promote an environment in which everyone feels safe and accepted,"" said Maccabi President Meyer.

https://www.dw.com/en/saudi-arabia-set-to-host-2034-world-cup/a-67266047,SOCCER,Saudi Arabia set to host 2034 World Cup 31.10.2023,"It would be a dream for anyone running for office, no opposing candidate, election by acclamation. October 31 was the deadline for national football associations from Asia or Oceania to express their interest to world soccer's governing body FIFA in hosting the 2034 World Cup. So far, only Saudi Arabia is known to have done so, making the Gulf state a shoo-in for the bid.
In early October, FIFA announced that the 2030 World Cup would be played on three continents: Europe (Spain and Portugal), Africa (Morocco) and South America (Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay). Due to its principle of rotating hosts among the continents, Europe, Africa and South America were thus ruled out for 2034.
The same applied to North and Central America, with the USA, Mexico and Canada set to host the 2026 World Cup. Therefore, FIFA said, it would only accept bids from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) – which includes Australia – and the Oceania Football Confederation for 2034.
A few hours later, Saudi Arabia officially threw its hat into the ring. Football Australia also signaled its interest, albeit rather half-heartedly, obviously in search of a co-host. At first, it looked like Indonesia could fit the bill, but just a week later, Erick Thohir, president of the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI), announced its support for the Saudi bid.
At an online meeting of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), FIFA President Gianni Infantino had previously called on its members to ""be united for the 2034 World Cup."" Saudi media reported that more than 100 of FIFA's 211 had expressed support for Riyadh's bid.
Just hours before the FIFA deadline, Australia officially withdrew from the race.
""We have explored the opportunity to bid to host the FIFA World Cup and – having taken all factors into consideration – we reached the conclusion not to do so for the 2034 competition,"" Football Australia said in a statement.
Saudi Arabia has been investing heavily in sports for years, including Formula 1, golf, and especially football. Superstars such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and Sadio Mane now earn their money in the Saudi league. In December, the Gulf state is to host the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time.
Human rights organizations accuse Riyadh of ""sports washing"" – the practice of using the glamor of sporting events to distract international attention from massive human rights violations being committed in the country.
""The possibility that FIFA could award Saudi Arabia the 2034 World Cup despite its appalling human rights record and closed door to any monitoring exposes FIFA's commitments to human rights as a sham,"" Human Rights Watch director of global initiatives Minky Worden said in a statement.
Amnesty International called on FIFA to tie the 2034 World Cup bid to much-needed reforms in Saudi Arabia.
""FIFA must now make clear how it expects hosts to comply with its human rights policies. It must also be prepared to halt the bidding process if serious human rights risks are not credibly addressed,"" Steve Cockburn, Amnesty's head of economic and social justice said in a statement.

https://www.dw.com/en/artificial-intelligence-in-sport-the-key-to-success/a-67258191,SPORTS,Artificial intelligence in sport — the key to success? 31.10.2023,"Elite sports are about passion and unpredictable results. Coaches make decisions based on their gut and influence games. It's the way it has always been — up until very recently. Nowartificial intelligence (AI) is starting to influence coaching at elite level. But will its use make sports more predictable and less emotional?
Data has been used to analyze games for years, but when it comes to evaluation, coaches are increasingly reaching the limits of their capacity. That's because game data is becoming more accurate and extensive. This is the field where AI should help in the future.
""Artificial intelligence is a technology executed by computers and machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence but are usually too complex for people,"" says sports scientist Daniel Memmert from the German Sport University Cologne.
""These AI systems use data and algorithms to autonomously recognize and objectively evaluate patterns of play.""
It is precisely this objective evaluation that is distinct from the often subjective assessments of a coach, adds Memmert.
AI has revolutionized data-based analysis and is having a greater influence on tactical decisions, injury prevention and training load.
""Sports clubs have brutally expanded the use of AI,"" Memmert explains. ""Clubs have realized how much they can do with the data they collect.""
Sport clubs are also expanding their expertise. Rather than employing people with experience in a specific sport, clubs are turning more and more to programmers and computer scientists.
""In 2017, Barcelona employed 15 new data and video analysts, as well as data scientists,” Memmert says, adding: ""The use of AI systems will lead to more people working in elite sport, not fewer.”
Because, as Memmert explains, teams will always need experts who know the sport really well and who can work with the information and metrics that AI delivers.
In the meantime, AI is being used in a variety of areas. At Germany's Bundesliga 2 club Schalke, scouts are using AI to support their search for new players.
""We have defined about 40 values in our scouting and for three of them we use artificial intelligence and decide whether these are values that make the difference for us,"" Schalke sports director Peter Knäbel told German public broadcaster ZDF.
""For example, you define a player's change-of-space behavior, for example, the accuracy with which he passes the ball. And put artificial intelligence on top of that.""
In this way, it is easy to see whether a footballer has a similar value as a player who has departed. Nevertheless, the final decision about a signing still lies with the scout and the coaches. In this case, AI is another way to better assess potential Schalke players ahead of time.
Intelligent systems are also being used in handball. For years, players in the Handball Bundesliga have worn sensors that collect millions of pieces of information, including distance covered, speed, positional play and biometric data.
""We feed the computer with this information so it learns how a handball game works,” says coach Michael Döring. ""The system is, at the beginning, like a small child, and it learns how to understand the game better with the data it gets fed.""
In the last two years, AI has been gathered from around 600 handball games. SG Flensburg-Handewitt's system has accumulated a great deal of knowledge about the sport and in the club's data analysis, AI can now predict the likelihood of a goal.
That means Döring and his colleagues can see which players in which positions have the best chance to score.
""Where should the line player be? How should we start the second wave? These are then suddenly things where we have added value,"" the sports scientist tells DW. ""It's like an additional advisor. And we can use this data-based approach to make our system more successful.""
Döring, who used to be a handball coach, works in Flensburg's team of experts as a facilitator between the data and the coach. Because not all the information that is fed into AI is helpful for training or the tactical approach in a game.
""We take the questions from practice and insert them into theory. And the knowledge we then get from the AI-based analysis we have to package in such a way that you can also do something with it in practice.""
In the future, handball players hope that the use of artificial intelligence will help them with tactical questions but also with putting together a team that will have the highest possible probability of success.
Nevertheless, the use of AI-based data remains in its infancy. The current system is only as intelligent as the information it receives from people. However, it will continue to develop rapidly, further digitalize and change sport.
""The more players there are on a field, the more complex the patterns that occur. So the more people are active in a sport, the larger amounts of data that can be collected and the more it makes sense to have this data processed by smart algorithms,"" says Memmert.

https://www.dw.com/en/alpine-ski-world-cup-grapples-with-climate-challenges/a-67257154,SPORTS,Alpine Ski World Cup grapples with climate challenges 30.10.2023,"A little snow did fall after all on the Rettenbach glacier this past weekend. The glacier, which lies near Sölden, Austria, is where the Alpine Ski World Cup kicked off its new season with two giant slalom races. While the women's event went off without a hitch on Saturday, Sunday's men's competition had to be canceled due to high winds.
Sölden has hosted the opening event of the season since 2000. This year, there wasn't much of a winter feel to the weekend until the very end; the mountains around the glacier were barely covered with snow, the slopes towards the valley were green, the trees sporting the colors of autumn. And even up on the glacier, the thin layer of fresh snow could hardly conceal the problems that Alpine ski racing is facing.
""I think the slope is perfect for hosting a World Cup opener,"" Felix Neureuther told Bavarian media a few weeks ago. ""But the end of October is just too early.""
Neureuther, who was Germany's top ski racer before he retired from the sport in 2019, is concerned about the event's future, partly because organizers are having to contend with less and less natural snow on the slopes.
To get the Rettenbach slopes ready for last weekend's event, 45,000 cubic meters (nearly 1.6 million cubic feet) of snow that had been stored in depots since April was spread over the course. This is not the first time organizers have had to take such measures to ensure that the season opener could go ahead.
Such circumstances have caused some to question the wisdom of starting the winter season so early. However, the Ski World Federation FIS under President Johan Eliasch has inflated the World Cup calendar to 45 races for both the women and men in recent years, leaving little scope for moving the opener to a later date.
Still, Eliasch surprised Austrian public broadcaster ORF on the weekend when he said: ""I also don't understand who is interested in ski racing in October and why we race on glaciers without snow.""
Eliasch said he hoped that the Austrian Ski Association would be open to moving back the Sölden event.
He had also, however, pushed for races to be held on the Matterhorn in mid-November. At the end of November, the World Cup heads to North America for a couple of weekends before returning to Europe. A race is scheduled for every weekend leading up to Christmas.
This tight schedule forced the October opener in Sölden, as well as all the work that had to be done to get the Rettenbach glacier ready in time. This included the bringing in of excavators to shave off the edge of the glacier in preparation for the application of the stored snow.
That drew harsh criticism from environmentalist groups.
""The current destruction of nature on the Rettenbach glacier is a disaster. Skiing and conservation are being played off against each other here,"" Ursula Bittner, an economics specialist at Greenpeace Austria, told Austrian media in September.
The organizers defended themselves, saying it was not a matter of removing the glacier. Instead, they explained, large rocks that had come to the surface as a result of the glacier receding needed to be crushed. Doing so, they argued, meant that less snow was needed to prepare the slope. In other words, the excavator work was in the interest of sustainability.
This illustrates just how emotional and complicated the dispute is between environmental interests and the million-dollar downhill skiing business. It is also indicative of a growing problem for outdoor winter sports in general.
The Winter Olympics are no exception. When Sochi, a Black Sea resort with a subtropical climate hosted the 2014 Games, the ski resorts were located dozens of kilometers away. Major construction projects were undertaken to build not only the ski runs but also the infrastructure for traveling between the two locations.
Beijing, the host of the 2022 Winter Games, isn't known for its heavy snowfall either. The same goes for the two Olympic ski resorts, which were located in a region that is cold enough, but hardly gets any precipitation.
""Fewer and fewer countries are capable of hosting the Winter Olympics in the first place,"" Jules Boykoff told DW. The political scientist from Pacific University in Oregon has been critically examining the Olympic Games and their impact on society and the environment for years.
International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach, too, is well aware of the problem.
""By 2040, there remain, practically, just 10 national Olympic committees who could host these snow events of the Olympic Winter Games,"" Bach told the recent IOC Congress in Mumbai, based on the findings of a study on future viability.
As a result, the IOC is considering implementing a rotation system for hosts, comprising only a few locations that are all but guaranteed to regularly have the required amount of snow in February.
As Boykoff noted, the lack of reliable snow is not the only challenge facing the games, with residents of numerous cities having rejected the idea of hosting a Winter or Summer Olympics from 2013 through 2018.
""You are seeing a rising tide of people across the political spectrum who do not want to have the Olympics in their city or in their country because of the price tag and because of the environmental effects,"" he said.
The 2026 Winter Games are to be hosted by Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, where mass protests over exploding costs and ecological concerns convinced organizers to abandon plans to build a new bobsleigh and luge track. These events may be moved to Innsbruck, Austria.
Where the Winter Games go after 2026 is unclear and, if no traditional winter venue steps up, the IOC could soon find itself in a dilemma. Saudi Arabia won the right to host the 2029 Asian Winter Games with a plan to spend $500 billion (€472 billion) to construct venues and infrastructure. Depending upon how well that goes, the Winter Olympics could be the next logical step, as early as 2034.

The soccer chief kissed Spain player Jenni Hermoso on the lips without her consent after Spain won the title in August in Sydney in a 1-0 victory over England. A week later, FIFA provisionally suspended Rubiales.
""This case relates to the events that occurred during the final of the FIFA Women's World Cup on 20 August 2023, for which Mr. Rubiales had been provisionally suspended for an initial period of 90 days,"" said a statement from FIFA. 
Rubiales came under pressure from members of the national women's team and Spanish politicians for his behavior. He eventually resigned as president in September, despite having previously insisted he would not do.
FIFA did not publish details of how disciplinary committee judges reached their verdict. However, it did say they had investigated charges relating to ""basic rules of decent conduct"" and ""behaving in a way that brings the sport of football and/or FIFA into disrepute.""
In addition to the kiss, Rubiales was criticized for grabbing his crotch as a victory gesture while seated in an exclusive section of seats, close to Queen Letizia of Spain and 16-year-old Princess Sofia.

Rubiales has the right to appeal the decision.
Hermoso had earlier filed a legal complaint over the unsolicited kiss. Rubiales is also under criminal investigation over the incident. 
She was not picked for the first post-World Cup games in September, but returned on Friday to score an emotional late 1-0 winner against Italy.
The case also saw women's coach Jorge Vilda sacked after his own staff resigned. The coach, accused of trying to convince Hermoso to back down, was already under fire from team members over his unpopular training methods.
His deputy Montse Tome is now in charge, with Spain set to play Switzerland in the Nations League on Tuesday.

""Tonight, Siya Kolisi and the 2023 World Cup champions have gifted us an extraordinary, inspired and inspiring national achievement that lifts our hearts and hoists our flag even higher.""
The nature of this win, their run to the final and the way in which the group has squeezed every drop out of their talent has made this a popular team, adored at home.
""I guess as a team we like drama,"" said Springboks flanker Pieter-Steph du Toit, the player of the final. ""We have had drama for the last few years. It helped us a lot as a team to get through the drama and cope with it and it shows the resilience of the team.""
While perhaps not quite as adored further afield, this champion team is deeply respected, both for its on and off-the-field achievements.
""Congratulations to our South African brothers! The thing I love about this team's success is what it does for the country, especially those in poverty,"" wrote New Zealand All Blacks great Sonny Bill Williams on X, formerly Twitter, before going on to further explain his perspective (see below tweet).
For All Blacks skipper Sam Cane, who became the first male player to be sent off in a World Cup final, the sporting emotions were in sharp contrast to Kolisi, but the pride was similar.
""It's so, so hard,"" he said. ""I'm feeling so much hurt, but I am so proud of the group the way they fought back and gave ourselves a shot of winning that game. It speaks volumes for the group as a whole. It is a fantastic group of men who care so much for playing for the All Blacks and making New Zealand proud. So there is a lot of heartbreak in the sheds [dressing room] right now. It is hard.""
While this was a sporting triumph first and foremost, when the celebrations calm South Africans will hope it can inspire some meaningful change, as suggested by Moloto Mothapo, a spokesman for the South African parliament. 
""This achievement exemplifies the transformative power of sport in South Africa. It's not just about the game; it's about its ability to unite our diverse nation, reinvigorate hope, and showcasing the strength that comes from our rich diversity.""
The Springboks are expected to return to a jubilant South Africa on Tuesday, but many hope their legacy will last much longer than this tournament.

https://www.dw.com/en/matthew-perry-friends-star-dies-at-54-reports/a-67246497,CULTURE,Matthew Perry: 'Friends' star dies at 54 — reports 29.10.2023,"Matthew Perry, the actor best known for playing the lovable and goofy Chandler Bing on the smash hit ""Friends"" TV show, has died, according to the ""Friends"" X account and Warner Bros. Television.
The blockbuster TV series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions and Warner Bros. Television.
The Los Angeles Times and celebrity news site TMZ first broke the news, citing anonymous sources.
They reported that first responders found Perry unconscious in a hot tub at his Los Angeles home. They were unable to revive him.
There was no indication of foul play, the media outlets said. Perry was 54. The investigation is ongoing and details about his death were not immediately available.
Perry recieved one Emmy nomination for his role in ""Friends"" and two more for appearances as an associate White House counsel on the ""The West Wing.""
Last year, Perry released his memoir, “Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir,"" about his battle with alcohol and addiction. 
He spend more than half his life in rehab and treatment centers, detoxing more than 65 times and paying millions trying to get sober.
He wrote about his near-death experience in 2018, when his colon burst.
Born in 1969, Perry grew up between Montreal and Los Angeles after his parents separated when he was a baby, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Perry first tried his hand at playing tennis and he was successful at a young age, but he left the sport to pursue a career in acting.
He began acting young and appeared in hits like ""Beverly Hills, 90210,"" and “A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon” opposite actor River Phoenix.
But his big break came on ""Friends"" that premiered in 1994 and where he starred opposite Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer.
Perry played the role of Chandler Bing, a character known for his witty one-liners, on the 90's TV sitcom that followed the lives of six single New Yorkers navigating adulthood.
The last episode of ""Friends"" aired in 2004 after a 10-year run that turned Perry and his cast mates into global celebrities. The show remains one of the most popular TV shows to date.
""Friends' was huge, I couldn't jeopardize that. I loved the script. I loved my co-actors. I love the scripts... but I was struggling with my addictions which only added to my sense of shame,"" Perry wrote in his memoir. ""I had a secret and no one could know,"" he wrote.

https://www.dw.com/en/olympics-problems-facing-paris-2024/a-67230968,SPORTS,Olympics: Problems facing Paris 2024 27.10.2023,"With less than nine months to go until the opening ceremony at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, the French capital is engaged in a race against time to get things ready.
DW rounds up some of the key challenges facing Paris ahead of the Games:
Anyone who has visited Paris will have encountered the hundreds of street vendors who ply their trade among the tourist crowds of the city center.
But authorities want to put an end to the unofficial industry, stopping people from selling on the streets ahead of the Olympics.
""We will have completely eradicated the phenomenon of street vending, fortune-telling and other delinquent activities,"" said Laurent Nunez, the prefect of police for Paris.
Among those businesses facing expulsion are the traditional bouquinistes, the booksellers who have been offering their wares from the wooden stalls along the banks of the Seine since the 16th century.
Police have said the traditional stalls, some of which have stood for over a century, could pose a bomb threat, especially with the area thronged by tens of thousands of spectators for the opening ceremony which will take place on and along the river.
It's not just books and cultural trinkets that are being cleared off Parisian streets; human beings are, too.
Although authorities insist it has nothing directly to do with the Olympics next year or the Rugby World Cup, the French government has been accelerating plans to transfer homeless people living on the streets of Paris to other French cities.
Approximately half of France's 200,000 homeless people live on the streets or in shelters in Paris and the surrounding Ile-de-France region, where they stand to benefit from better job chances, access to charities and contact with family and friends.
According to government figures disclosed to CNN in September, around 1,800 homeless people, mostly migrants, have been transferred out of Paris since April 2023 to alternative locations across the country — a rate of just over 50 people per week.
But the situation on the streets has nevertheless been exacerbated by the decisions of hotels to cancel their emergency housing contracts with the government to free up space for the anticipated influx of tourists for the Olympics.
Back in May, former Housing Minister Olivier Klein said in a parliamentary discussion that ""the approach of major sporting events — firstly, to a lesser extent, the Rugby World Cup in 2023, and then the Olympic Games in 2024 — means that we have to think ahead and anticipate the situation, thanks to a policy of decluttering.""
While the removal of homeless people from Paris might be controversial, the city's public spaces have also become home to another living creature that is universally unwelcome: bedbugs.
Numbers of punaises de lit have been increasing for several years in Paris, where one in 10 people have experienced infestations in the last five years, according to official figures. But this summer's annual spike is the highest yet.
And, even worse, it got traction on social media, with videos claiming to show the insects in beds and sofas at home, on public transport, and even in cinemas — although the reports remain unconfirmed.

Nevertheless, French authorities and Olympic organizers are concerned not only about the hygienic aspect but mainly about the psychological effect of a perceived infestation and the damage to the city's image ahead of the Olympics.
One place that organizers hope will be absolutely free of bedbugs is the new Olympic Village which is nearing completion in the Paris suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis. It is set to host 22,500 Olympians and Paralympians during the Games.
The future use of Olympic villages is a key question when it comes to the social legacy of any Games, and Paris 2024 is no different. Authorities have insisted that the village will be sustainable and environmentally friendly, having been fitted with geothermal heating and cooling systems to reduce the need for air conditioning.
But community groups are still worried about issues such as air pollution (only one of four proposed new metro connections has been completed) and affordability of housing after the Games, with flats often beyond the price range of residents in the poorest region in mainland France.
The approaching Olympics have also seen a reemergence of the decades-old debate over the wearing of religious symbols, in particular veils, in French public life which is constitutionally secular.
While France will not allow its athletes to wear head coverings, the International Olympic Committee has said athletes will be allowed to wear a veil if they wish in the Olympic Village. Each sport's federation decides the rules for its own event.
US fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad is the most high-profile athlete to have worn the hijab at the Olympic Games. She won a bronze medal in Team Sabre at Rio 2016 wearing the head covering.

https://www.dw.com/en/rugby-world-cup-final-south-africa-progress-faces-huge-test/a-67183673,SPORTS,Rugby World Cup final: South Africa progress faces huge test 26.10.2023,"South Africans could hardly watch as flyhalf Handre Pollard converted a late, late penalty in the Springboks' 16-15 win over England to book them a place in the final against New Zealand.
""It was really intense for all South Africans, let me tell you something! The anxiety was really real for all of us. We were on the edge of our seats,"" radio personality and sports journalist Carmen Reddy told DW.
On a wet night in Paris, where nothing seemed to go right for the South Africans, they somehow escaped with a win.
""That is what champions are made of,"" said captain Siya Kolisi afterwards.
It's something Kolisi would know better than most. Not only is his team the defending Rugby World Cup champion, but Kolisi and his teammates have battled through much more than a stoic English forwards pack to reach this stage.
The last time South Africa faced New Zealand for World Cup glory was the 1995 final at Ellis Park, Johannesburg. That day, the stoic Springboks edged the juggernaut, Jonah Lomu-inspired All Blacks 15-12.
A beaming Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first democratically-elected president, wore a Springbok jersey and handed the Webb Ellis trophy to captain Francois Pienaar. The scene would have been unthinkable just five years earlier: Mandela was in prison, racist laws forbade interracial sport, and South Africa was banned from international sporting events. For many, the moment symbolized Mandela trying to unify a society deeply fractured by apartheid.
Nowhere was this more apparent than in the sport of rugby. For decades, only white players were eligible to play for the Springboks, and they were so closely associated with the apartheid system that, even many years later, some South Africans refused to support the Springboks.
Chester Williams was the only Black player in the 1995 side. Transforming the sport remained dispiritingly slow and politically charged. A prevailing attitude was Springbok rugby could either remain the realm of elite sportsmen, or become more inclusive, but not both. Even South Africa's 2007 World Cup win featured just two non-white starters.
When Rassie Erasmus became head coach in 2018, the Boks were not considered world beaters. But the philosophy around transformation changed: for rugby to have a future in South Africa, it had to represent South Africa's people, and appeal to the best South Africa could offer. Crucially, only winning could drive support for this. Emphasis was put on giving Black players more game time rather than making up squad numbers, as had often been the case under the so-called quota systems previously employed in the sport. And an elite player development program runs throughout South African rugby to scout and catch talent from all communities. 
If Erasmus changed the direction of South African rugby, then the players pulled through – and how.
In 2019, Kolisi skippered the Springboks to a storming 32-12 win over heavily-favored England, with Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe scoring South Africa's first tries in a World Cup final.
""Captain Kolisi has become a national hero. I think rugby as a sport has grown even more in South Africa. It's also now appealing to a bigger audience and to more people because they're doing so well,"" Reddy told DW.
Now, Siya Kolisi's men can defend their title and become the only rugby nation to win four world titles, edging ahead of the All Blacks' three.
South Africa will have faced every other top ranked rugby nation come the All Blacks clash. But the nation has rallied behind the team like never before. Thrilling wins aside, South Africans have heroes in every position, from speedy try machines Kurt-Lee Arendse and Cheslin Kolbe, to hulking enforcer Eben Etzebeth, to cake-loving, game winning strongman Ox Nche, whose revelations that ""salads don't win scrums"" and he ""never counts calories, only slices of cake,"" has made him a cult hero. The replacement forward pack is affectionately called the 'Bomb Squad' for dismantling opposing scrums.
Inspirational skipper Kolisi's story to become the nation's first Black captain is well known, but the journeys of young Canan Moodie who defied poverty and gang violence to become a rising Springbok star, and others, have added to the aura of the South African team.
""The idea of 'look at us working together' really appeals to two different parts of society, if you're looking at it in terms of race or culture or background, "" Reddy explains, ""but it also gives us a sense of unity in terms of where both you and me, as different as our backgrounds are, we are supporting the same thing.""
South African players have talked about the importance of their fans and country throughout, like flyhalf Pollard after the England semi-final: ""The fight we showed, never giving up, it is what we stand for as a team and as a nation.""
Much has evolved for the Boks since the 1995 final, but the goal, and monumental task, is almost identical: the All Blacks have pulverized all before them since an opening day loss to France. No team has ever beaten the Boks as often as New Zealand. Their last match, a tournament warmup, saw South Africa win handily. But it will count for nothing as rugby’s biggest rivals meet at biggest stage. The pressure is on.
Yet, South Africa’s current director of rugby Erasmus said after the 2019 win:
""Rugby shouldn't be something that creates pressure on you, but rather hope. No matter your political or religious differences, for those 80 minutes you agree on a lot of things you'd normally disagree on.""
The Springboks have provided plenty of hope, not just on the rugby pitch. The team is used to playing for much more than just rugby glory: South Africans are dealing with a crippling energy crisis, rampant crime, mind-boggling unemployment and financial inequality. 
""Emotionally and mentally, and people don't want to really talk about that, [the final] will bring us together in a way that I think we need and we deserve,"" Reddy told DW. ""South Africa really needs this. I think especially now, just before Christmas!""
So when South Africa comes to a standstill on Saturday for 80 minutes, for once it won’t be due to power cuts, but a nation caught up in rugby fever.

https://www.dw.com/en/iran-regime-intimidates-journalists-with-long-prison-terms/a-67205640,POLITICS,Iran regime intimidates journalists with long prison terms 25.10.2023,"Two award-winning journalists, Niloofar Hamedi and Elaheh Mohammadi, were among the first to report on the death of the Kurdish woman Jina Mahsa Amini in the fall of 2022, which triggered a huge wave of protests across  Iran. They were immediately arrested and charged with collaborating with the United States, conspiring against state security and propaganda against the Islamic Republic.
Their trial was held on camera and lasted several months. Both journalists have now been found guilty and sentenced to long prison terms: Hamedi will serve seven years in prison, with Mohammadi sentenced to six.
""First, they were accused of espionage, even though their employers, two Iranian newspapers, repeatedly stressed that both journalists were assigned to cover the case,"" says Moein Khazaeli. Khazaeli studied law and political science at Tehran University and at Malmö University in Sweden. He currently works as a legal expert specializing in media issues.
Khazaeli points out that, even in Iranian law, the verdict has no legal basis — ""above all because no evidence was presented against Hamedi and Mohammadi."" The verdict now claims that they changed societal behavior from passivity to activism. ""This is not a criminal offense under Iranian law,"" says Khazaeli. ""It is absurd that the verdict contains this wording. It clearly shows how the Iranian judiciary and security agencies regard people who demand their civil rights as criminals.""

Nilufar Hamedi reported for Shargh, one of Iran's biggest daily newspapers, from the hospital where Jina Mahsa Amini lay in a coma after being detained and presumably beaten by Iran's so-called morality police. Elaheh Mohammadi, a reporter with the daily Ham-Mihan newspaper, traveled to Amini's hometown of Saqqez in the Kurdistan province of northwestern Iran to cover her funeral, which was followed by one of the first protests. In May, while Hamedi and Mohammadi were being held in prison, the UN cultural organization UNESCO awarded the journalists its World Press Freedom Prize in absentia.
The verdict sends ""a warning sign to all media professionals who seek the truth and do their work despite reprisals,"" the journalist Moloud Hajizadeh told DW. Hajizadeh was arrested several times for her reporting on the protest movements in Iran. In January 2021, she was sentenced to one year in prison, but fled Iran before she was due to start her sentence, and now lives in Norway.
""The political system shows how ruthlessly it deals with journalists and how easily it can ruin their lives by putting them behind bars,"" she explains, adding that it was ""no coincidence"" that the verdict against the two journalists ""was announced at the same time as the news that Armita was brain dead.""
The case of the 16-year-old schoolgirl Armita Geravand, who is in a coma, is stirring up Iranian society once more. According to an eyewitness, who spoke to Britain's Guardian newspaper on October 5, Geravand was attacked on the Tehran subway on October 2 by a female ""morality police"" officer enforcing the requirement that women wear hijab. Geravand, who was on her way to school, was not wearing a headscarf. Iranian authorities deny this report; they claim that Geravand fainted because she had low blood pressure.
The Iranian authorities boast that the Tehran subway is monitored by surveillance cameras all across the network. And yet they are claiming that, of all places, the carriage in which Geravand was injured did not have a camera. Instead, they have published pictures from surveillance cameras at the station, but these do not provide any information about what happened in the carriage.
Iran's Borna news agency, which is linked to the Ministry of Sport and Youth, said in a statement on Sunday that Geravand's condition was ""not encouraging, and despite the efforts of doctors, she appears to be brain dead.""
The case is reminiscent of Amini's death in September 2022. Shortly after Amini was arrested by the morality police for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly, she was taken to hospital in a coma. Her death led to months of protests against the political system, in which hundreds of people died and thousands were imprisoned — among them Niloofar Hamedi and Elaheh Mohammad, the journalists who publicized the case.

https://www.dw.com/en/education-deficit-in-argentinian-football-says-former-star/a-67195353,SOCCER,"Education deficit in Argentinian football, says former star 25.10.2023","Former Premier League and Argentina striker Carlos Tevez made a shocking revelation in a recent interview with Argentinian broadcaster El Nueve.
""Three of the boys we have in the squad today, obviously I won't say their names, told me they did not know how to add or subtract,"" the man now head coach of Independiente, one of the biggest clubs in the country, said.
Footballers forgoing their education in pursuit of a professional career is not unheard of across the globe, but Tevez's comments seemed so extreme.
The 39-year-old explained how pivotal it is that young people know how to read, express themselves correctly and make informed decisions, both for life and a potential career in football where the ability to read and understand contracts is an important part of career management.
Independiente has since responded, arranging classes for players so they can study after training every day until they have filled the gaps in their education. But the comments of their head coach have highlighted a glaring issue.
Despite having one of the best K–12 — from kindergarten to 12th grade — education systems on the continent, Argentina still suffers from a high dropout rate in upper secondary schools. A 2023 UNESCO (The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) report revealed that according to data from the Permanent Household Survey in Argentina, three out of 10 students do not complete their schooling.
Mariano Levisman is an Argentinian football coach and economist who has worked at a number of teams across Argentina. He believes that part of the problem is the amount of travel required for young footballers in the Argentinian system.
""I spoke to one player who was nominated for Argentina's U17 team and may be part of the U17 World Cup squad [who said], 'I'm coming to Buenos Aires every one to two weeks, I stay the whole week. How can I go to my school in Cordoba?'"" Levisman told DW, before adding another player he spoke to told him he had to move six times to finish school.
""You also have poor people who are struggling with the balance between needing to go to work before they are finished with school,"" Levisman explained.
A lot depends on the family, the club and the school but even then there is no escaping the travel. Youth players in Argentina play all around the country, some traveling from Buenos Aires to Tucuman, for example, which is an 18-hour bus journey. That means leaving on Thursday to play Saturday, which is two days out of school. And that's every weekend you play away.
To combat the geographical challenges, FIFPRO's (The global football players union) Director of Education in South American Jose Pablo Burtovoy says they have developed a program that allows young players at any of the 152 professional clubs in the country to finish their high school education virtually, on phones or computers.
FIFPRO's affiliated player union in the country, Futbolistas Argentinos Agremiados, launched the ""Go back to study"" campaign in early 2023, but Burtovoy acknowledges high school is the real challenge.
""At the moment we have 580 young and professional footballers who are finishing their high school studies,"" Burtovoy tells DW. ""It is a job that we are tackling very strongly and there is a lot to do because in professional football more than 35% are school dropouts.""
""What Carlos [Tevez] is raising is a problem that needs to be addressed. There is much more to do. That's why it's important that the new generation in management, technical directors, coaches, has healthy communication and addresses these issues,"" he continued.
Burtovoy, a former goalkeeper who played in several Latin American countries between 1993 and 2014, added that 3,000 football players have their studies paid for by sporting institutions every year but he wants to see that number closer to 30,000.
With so much focus on technique and tactics, the real drive has been towards a new conversation around the athlete as a whole and how big a role developing the athlete's intellect plays in the overall success of the individual. But that becomes much more difficult when the young player in question shows an ability beyond his years.
""If they're good, then it becomes less easy to say no to the player playing if their grades aren't good,"" Levisman explains. ""The big clubs, such as Boca Juniors and River Plate, can afford to say you're not playing because you're not good [in terms of grades] because they have more talented players to choose from and more resources, but for smaller clubs it's not so easy.""
That is a challenge for football academies all over the world. But for people like Burtovoy, this work is not just necessary to give young people the best chance in life, but also pivotal to the world's understanding of Argentina.
""The footballers in this country are a population that changes people's lives. So, if we keep working on perfecting what we do on the pitch, there is always something to improve, to develop, to grow, perfect. But if we reinforce that with education, with knowledge we really are the people that can change the lives of the people in your neighborhood, your city, your province and your country.""
""I'm not saying this because I'm passionate, I'm saying it because of the data. In Argentina, footballers have been throughout history and today more than ever, a source of pride and the most representative population of our country in the world.""

https://www.dw.com/en/cameroons-ghost-town-days-how-residents-cope-in-lockdown/a-67110298,CONFLICTS,Cameroon's 'ghost town' days: How residents cope in lockdown 23.10.2023,"It's 10 a.m. on a Monday in the Mile 2 Nkwen locality of Bamenda, a city in northwestern Cameroon. The streets are empty.
Mondays are ""ghost town"" days in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon that became engulfed in a separatist crisis some seven years ago. 
In many communities, everyone is expected to stay home. Markets are closed, offices locked, and the streets deserted.
The separatists who took up arms against the government in Yaounde enforce the Monday lockdowns. Residents risk being attacked, kidnapped or shot if they disobey.
The separatists hope to mount pressure on the central government to make concessions for the Anglophone community in the country by stopping all economic activity once a week.
Cameroon has been plagued by fighting since English-speaking separatists launched a rebellion against the government in 2017. The dissidents say they want the region to secede from the area dominated by the French-speaking majority and aim to create an independent, English-speaking state.
As a way out of the isolation and boredom of ""ghost towns,"" residents are finding new ways to network and support each other.
There are social and sports clubs, credit and thrift schemes, choirs or salons to stay active. 
In Bamenda, one economic network benefits all members. Financial contributions  are saved, pooled and paid out on a rotational basis to individual members.
The ""Prosperous Neighbors"" social network president, Ambechi Louis, says that despite the difficult security situation, members are finding ways to remain hopeful.
""We use Mondays for our meeting days because we used to hold them on Sundays, and people often had other commitments. Since Mondays are a free day in the region, more people can participate,"" Louis tells DW.
Carine belongs to a social network group for women only. Mondays are her chance to get to know her neighbors better since everyone is busy throughout the rest of the week, she says.
""We are into neighbor solidarity and many others like veteran sporting clubs. Monday is a day to be home, so we want to use that to exercise, participate in online groups, wash clothes, meet friends and socialize,"" Carine tells DW.
Pubs in several communities are cashing in on the ""ghost town"" days. On Mondays, some pubs even apply a members-only policy and decline to serve drinks to anyone outside of their communities.
One pub owner, known as ""Spice Boy,"" says strangers aren't allowed entry for security reasons. Any resident of the community will, however, be served.
""The days that the sales are [good] are Mondays,"" he tells DW. ""The reason is simple: We have meetings that have all been moved from Sundays to Mondays, and after these meetings, [people] come to drink and socialize.""
""Spice Boy"" says a normal day can bring in about €50-70 ($53-73), but a ""ghost town"" day can net double. 
""Mondays can be very boring, and to end the boredom, people come to drink,"" he said.

But some analysts are worried about the prevailing situation of the ""ghost towns"" and the implications for the economic activities in the region.
""You see, 'ghost towns' are very bad for the economy. Bamenda, for example, has lost its place as the fastest growing city in the sub-region,"" Stephen Nsum, an economist and a Bamenda-based university lecturer, told DW.
He believes that if the phenomenon isn't eliminated, it could plunge more people into poverty.
""Thousands have been laid off from their jobs because salaries can't be paid. Investors have pulled out of the two Anglophone regions, and even the biggest state employer after the public service is on its knees,"" Nsum said.
""If ghost towns are ended, there is hope the region shall gradually return to its part to economic recovery,"" he added.
The English-speaking regions of Cameroon remain conflict zones, with lives lost, properties destroyed, and the humanitarian crisis worsening.

https://www.dw.com/en/how-german-football-is-responding-to-israel-hamas-conflict/a-67182890,CONFLICTS,How German football is responding to Israel-Hamas conflict 23.10.2023,"The name of the street which leads up to the MEWA Arena, the home stadium of Bundesliga side Mainz 05, is a history lesson in itself: ""Eugen-Salomon-Strasse.""
Born in 1888, Eugen Salomon was a young footballer and founder member of Mainz's predecessor club in 1905, becoming its first chairman aged just 17. Salomon was also Jewish and, as such, was stripped of his club functions by the Nazis in 1933 before fleeing with his family to France. From there, he was ultimately deported to Auschwitz and murdered in November 1942.
The story is important because it goes a long way to explaining why Mainz 05 this week decided to suspend Dutch forward Anwar El Ghazi for an Instagram post regarding the current conflict in the Middle East.
In it, the 28-year-old, who only joined the club this summer, had expressed his solidarity with the Palestinian people, over 4,600 of whom, many children, have been killed by Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip following a deadly terrorist attack by Hamas militants on Israel on October 7.
But he also wrote the sentence: ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free."" The phrase is considered by many legal experts in Germany to constitute an approval of a crime under paragraph 140 of the German Criminal Code in that it can be interpreted as a demand for the region between the River Jordan and Mediterranean Sea to be free of the Jewish state of Israel – an interpretation disputed by some Palestinian groups.
In Berlin, state prosecutors have even launched an investigation into the phrase as potential ""hate speech"" under paragraph 130 of the penal code after it was chanted at several pro-Palestinian demonstrations in the city.
During his visit to Israel last week, German chancellor Olaf Scholz affirmed that the existence of Israel is Germany's ""reason of state,"" reiterating the country's responsibility for the murder of over 6 million Jews during the Holocaust.
Among them, Eugen Salomon of Mainz. In a statement, Mainz 05 said it ""respects the different perspectives in the complex, decade-long conflict in the Middle East,"" but said that El Ghazi's position on the issue ""was not compatible with the values of our club.""
And despite the team's current sporting crisis – the 3-1 defeat to Bayern extended their winless run to 12 Bundesliga games stretching back to last season and left them bottom of the league – there is broad support for the decision in Mainz.
""It's not ideal because we specifically signed [El Ghazi] in the summer, but I also stand behind the decision,"" said Danish head coach Bo Svensson. ""I think we've done the right thing.""
After the post on the club's official account on X, formerly Twitter, announcing El Ghazi's suspension on October 17 attracted over 9,400 replies, the majority pro-Palestinian with seemingly no previous allegiance to Mainz 05, the club turned the reply function off. The club's Instagram account is still inaccessible.
""It's difficult to judge comments made online because they come from people whose connection to Mainz 05 is actually unclear,"" explained Mara Pfeiffer, a Mainz-based journalist and author who has reported on the club for years. ""There's also often a stark difference of opinion between those fans at home on the sofa and those in the stadium.""
Indeed, in numerous conversations outside the MEWA Arena on Saturday, DW heard unanimous support for the club's decision, with many fans referring – unprompted – to club founder Salomon.
""We're stood at the end of Eugen-Salomon-Strasse,"" said Margit. ""Freedom of speech is important but not when it's anti-Semitic. So when I hear that phrase, 'from the river to the sea,' that means that everything in between shouldn't be there. And I can't countenance that.""
Another fan, Andreas, agreed, saying: ""It was an important decision especially given the historical context and the fact that one of our club founders was a Mainz Jew who was murdered. So I can't tolerate that phrase.""
Inside the stadium, a moment's silence was held for the victims of the conflict, during which Mainz's hardcore ultras held up banners expressing ""solidarity with all victims of Islamism and anti-Semitism"" and condemning the ""anti-Semitic terror of Hamas"" – but also demanding ""peace for the people of Gaza!""
""The active fan scene in Mainz has always taken a pro-peace position on such issues and, from my perspective, is aware of the nuance here as well,"" explained Pfeiffer. ""That means not taking this side or that side, but rather being on the side of peace, of the civilians, of those opposing war. That nuance isn't always a given.""
But not all clubs have responded in the same way as Mainz.
In the most prominent case, Bayern Munich have refrained from punishing Morocco defender Noussair Mazraoui after he posted a similar pro-Palestinian message on Instagram.
After holding ""a detailed and clarifying conversation"" with Mazraoui in the week, Bayern chief executive Jan-Christian Dreesen said the club ""condemns Hamas' attack on Israel"" and insisted: ""Noussair has credibly assured us that as a peace-loving person he resolutely rejects terror and war and he never meant to cause any irritation with his posts.""
Mazraoui himself is quoted as saying: ""I condemn all terrorism and terrorist organizations.""
But for Alon Meyer, the president of Makkabi Deutschland, the umbrella organization for Jewish sports clubs in Germany with over 6,500 members, Mazraoui's response was unsatisfactory.
""Not a single mention of the massacre,"" he said on ZDF Sportstudio on Saturday night. ""Not a single expression of condolence. Not a single mention of the state of Israel – maybe, perhaps, because he doesn't recognize it. No single word of apology. And no condemnation of Hamas. What does that tell you?""
In recent years, many Bundesliga clubs have adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) working definition of anti-Semitism, including Bayern Munich. In cooperation with fan groups, Bayern have also worked to promote the legacy of Kurt Landauer, a Jewish former club president who fled the Nazis in the 1930s. 
""Bayern have done a lot of good work and have worked closely with the Jewish community and the state of Israel, but what's the point if their elite players post things like this?"" said Meyer. ""It undermines our daily work to build bridges and break down stereotypes.""
The Central Council of Jews in Germany (ZRJ) concurred that Mazraoui's personal remarks were unsatisfactory, but described Bayern Munich's decision as ""appropriate given the clear stance the club has always shown.""
The case has been made even more controversial given that one of Mazraoui's teammates, reserve goalkeeper Daniel Peretz, is the only Israeli player in the Bundesliga.
In an Instagram video last week, the Israel U21 international called on ""all athletes and sports organizations"" to stand together. ""Let us fight evil together,"" he said. During the moment's silence in Mainz on Saturday, Peretz looked visibly emotional.
No statement has yet come from Bayern Munich's supporters, who have regularly positioned themselves clearly against anti-Semitism and have embraced their club's Jewish heritage. That may change when Bayern play Darmstadt at home next Saturday.
Elsewhere in Germany this weekend, Freiburg supporters highlighted a Molotov cocktail attack on a synagogue in Berlin and cases of Stars of David being daubed outside Jewish homes with a banner reading: ""'Never again' is now. Against all anti-Semitism.""
The reason for that stance, and indeed for Germany's acute sensitivity when it comes to the potential of expressions of support for the Palestinian cause to slip into anti-Semitism more generally, can be found on Eugen-Salomon-Strasse in Mainz.
""You have to be so careful because [such sentiments] lead to expulsion and war,"" said Mainz fan Margit outside the stadium on Saturday. ""History teaches us that.""

https://www.dw.com/en/paris-olympics-fuel-gentrification-fears-in-poor-district/a-67046543,BUSINESS,Paris Olympics fuel gentrification fears in poor district 22.10.2023,"The 52-hectare (128-acre) area is bustling with trucks, a constant hammering is in the air. It's the final stretch for construction works at the village for the Summer Olympics 2024 which is to be completed by the end of this year.
And these grey, white and red buildings could not only provide a temporary home for the games' 14,500 Olympic and 6,000 Paralympic athletes. Local authorities are hoping the village will also, ultimately, upgrade the department of Seine-Saint-Denis, a Paris suburb and mainland France's poorest area.
But some residents most of all fear the project's negative impact.
""We have worked with 40 architects from around the world to design the city of the 21st Century,"" says Marion Le Paul, deputy director general at Solideo, the public- sector organisation tasked with financing, supervising and delivering the Olympic facilities.
She noted that construction of the village will cause 47% less CO2 due to the use of wood and low-carbon concrete. Materials are transported by ship which means that 25,000 truck journeys can be avoided.
""We've also been installing geothermal heating and cooling systems in the apartments, that can now go without air conditioning units,"" she added.
Solideo is investing €1.7 billion ($1.79 billion) in the project. Construction works kicked off in late 2020 with up to 3,000 builders deployed at the site simultaneously.
Four real estate investors — Vinci Immobilier, Icade, Legendre Immobilier and Nexity — are carrying out the works after having bought the premises from the public authorities. After the games, the French companies will remodel and then sell or rent the 2,800 apartments and office area with space for up to 6,000 workers.
Mathieu Hanotin, mayor of the town of Saint-Denis, thinks the new village in town, and other Olympic infrastructure such as a new nearby swimming pool, is ""excellent news.""
""This project will considerably enhance the value of this area — also as it'll bring us new roads, bridges, anti-noise walls and power lines,"" he told DW.
But Hamid Ouidir is skeptical. The 50-year-old is a member of the so-called Vigilance Committee of the Olympic Games in Saint-Denis that includes local residents.
""We were really happy when we heard the games would come here, but now we feel like we're being steamrollered,"" he told DW while standing in front of one of the newly constructed buildings.
The father of two young children worries that the area's air quality during and after the games might deteriorate further. ""We have carried out measurements over five months and detected that air pollution is constantly above the limit considered safe for the human health. These values are likely to be even worse with the additional inhabitants and traffic,"" Ouidir explained.
He doubts that four new planned metro connections — only one will be finished on time for the games — will lower air pollution much. ""People here will still take their car to work.""
Ouidir also refuted the argument that the additionally constructed flats will ease the housing shortage that Saint-Denis, like many other French departments, is experiencing. ""The new flats will only increase the number of inhabitants, as people from Saint-Denis can't afford to buy apartments for €7000 per square meter.""
But real estate investor Icade says that's not entirely true. The company is constructing and will sell 643 of the village's apartments, 200 of which have just been put on the market for private buyers.
""We've been contacted by interested buyers from Seine-Saint-Denis and other places such as Paris,"" Icade project manager Florence Chahid-Nourai told DW. ""And we're selling at market price – which is obviously higher for newly constructed flats than for older ones.""
Andrew Zimbalist, professor for economics at Smith College in Northampton in the northeastern US State of Massachusetts, has been looking at practically all Olympic Games — and their villages — since 1986.
""You normally get gentrification of neighborhoods: rents go up and people can no longer afford to live there,"" he explained to DW.
He added that there were very few examples of Olympic villages that later on increased an area's general welfare.
The village for the Summer Games 1996 in US city of Atlanta could be seen as one – but the project had a downside. ""The flats of the Olympic village are now being used as student dormitories,"" he said. ""But to build the village, the developers took over land from very low income communities, kicked them out and knocked down the houses they were living in.""
The economist says organizers should take into account so-called opportunity costs of projects. ""They need to ask themselves if the public money could be used in a more socially compatible way.""
For Ouidir, the answer to that question is yes. ""We'd really need a pharmacy and a public health center in the area,"" he stretched.
However, mayor Hanotin argues that the games can't solve all the area's problems. And he'd welcome some gentrification in Saint-Denis. ""The games will attract a more diverse population,"" he stated. ""We currently have 52% of council housing and need more regular flats to attract other population segments.""
With the local economic impact somehow debatable, can France at least be sure the games will have a beneficial impact on the economy as a whole?
Not necessarily, opines economist Zimbalist. ""The Olympics generally cost between $20 billion (€18.98 billion) and $40 billion but only generate roughly $5 billion of revenue.""
However, Wladimir Andreff, professor emeritus for economics at University Paris 1 and president of the Observatory for Sports Economics at France's Sports Ministry, is more optimistic.
""It's true that organizing cities often understate the costs of holding the Olympics — also when bidding to host the games,"" he told DW, adding that the Winter Olympics in the Russian city of Sochi had cost $50 billion instead of the initially estimated $6 billion. ""However, cost overruns in Paris have so far been moderate. France's Court of Auditors estimates the costs have by now only gone up by 30% to €8 billion.""

The bottom line, though, will only be known in hindsight – and it's complicated, underlines Luc Arrondel, professor for economics at Paris School of Economics. ""We have to take into account numerous indirect effects such as for example the fact that the games could improve the image of Seine-Saint-Denis in the eyes of international investors,"" he told DW.
In his opinion the games are likely to have one positive effect. ""Surveys during the London Summer Olympics 2012 have shown that Londoners were feeling a lot happier during the games, especially, of course, when their team won medals.""

https://www.dw.com/en/lukashenkos-personality-cult-anything-but-humble/a-67114843,POLITICS,Lukashenko's personality cult: anything but humble 22.10.2023,"Belarusian schoolchildren visit places associated with Alexander Lukashenko, the state film studio ""Belarusfilm"" is planning a movie about the strongman, and the ministry of justice has registered a charitable ""Foundation of the First."" It's named in honor of Lukashenko, whom the state media often call ""the First.""
And it doesn't end there. Quotes by Lukashenko are printed on articles of clothing, and a new flagship store has opened in the capital Minsk expressly for this type of fashion. There, buyers can find t-shirts and tracksuits printed with quotes such as ""Presidents are not made, presidents are born.""
Experts have observed that propaganda in Belarus has bolstered the personality cult surrounding Lukashenko, and has recently ramped up to support the narrative that Europe's last strongman enjoys the support of his people. This could have several reasons.
Leading up to the 2020 presidential election in Belarus, independent media wanted to know who their readers would cast their votes for. The poll yielded pretty awful results for Lukashenko: Only 3% said they'd vote for him. As a result, authorities banned such surveys. Belarus no longer has independent social research.
Government-friendly experts from the analysis center EccoM claim that, in 2022, 76.3% of the Belarusian population trusted Lukashenko, up from 72% the previous year. If that were the case, why is the personality cult surrounding Lukashenko being amplified?
Vadim Mojeiko is an analyst for the Belarusian Institute for Social Sutdies (BISS). He explained that a personality cult was part-and-parcel of any autocracy: ""Whenever a politician is in power for a long time, society needs constant reminders of what makes him so special and unique.""
The researcher pointed to events that took place around the 2020 elections, which were followed by mass protests. Lukashenko had been declared winner of the election, and brutally cracked down on those in the opposition. Since then, the expert explained, loyalty towards the regime had become a faith of sorts.
""Officials at various levels have understood that whoever praises Lukashenko can rise quickly,"" he said, adding that this was a way to help grease the wheels to allocate funds for various projects.
""I am certain that ‘Belarusfilm' will have not trouble finding money for its movie,"" he said.
Alesia Rudnik, director of the Belarusian Center for New Ideas that operates abroad believes the fresh momentum for Lukashenko's personality cult is linked to the upcoming 2025 presidential election.
""Even if Lukashenko did not enter the race, he and his statements would play a role. That's why propaganda is trying to draw positive attention to him,"" the political scientist explained. 
The other reason, according to Rudnik, was that even supporters of the regime were growing weary of its negative agenda. For three years, there have been daily reports of repression.
""The systematic persecution of citizens takes a great toll on the state apparatus. It requires additional expenditures, and many civil servants must focus their attention on repressions, rather than on solving the real problems they are actually responsible for. In this way, even Lukashenko's supporters start suspecting the regime might only be propped up by fear. Propaganda is meant to change this impression and create a positive image of Lukashenko,"" she said.  
The third reason for the rise in propaganda, Rudnik explained, was to show that Belarus had only one leader who steered the state's politics on his own and was able to make or reverse any decision, and that everything in the country depended on his wishes.
""During Yevgeny Prigozhin's rebellion, Lukashenko tried to present himself as a sort of referee.This was important in light of his frequent visits to Vladimir Putin, which gave the impression that he was completely dependent upon the Kremlin,""  she said.
""The propagandists are lying when they say that Lukashenko is a humble person who almost had to be convinced to allow a movie to be made about him,"" said Mojeiko. ""That is another part of a personality cult, pretending that initiatives like this were started by the people. In reality, Lukashenko likes to be admired, which he has made quite clear in public.""
It's also hardly modest when propagandists appear at meetings with Lukashenko sporting clothes bearing his quotes, or that he is often seen in public events surrounded by winners of beauty pageants.
All this, experts estimate, was part of an image created around him. ""Lukashenko does not appear as a humble man. On the contrary. He emphasized that he knows everything better than everybody else,"" said Rudnik.
At the same time, experts have also noticed that the propaganda surrounding Lukashenko is still far from the kind of personality cults that can be observed in several Central and East Asian countries. In Kazakhstan, for example Nursultan Nazarbayev also had a foundation with his name during his presidency, as well as multiple films in his honor. He's also had memorials dedicated to him, and even the capital was — for a time — named after him.
""If Lukashenko wanted a hundred-meter statue in his honor, nobody would dare to object. But he knows that such grotesque displays would not sit well will Belarusians. They have a different mentality. That's why the personality cult will continue to rise, but not to the point that the capital Minsk is renamed ‘Lukashensk,'"" Mojeiko believed.
But Rudnik would not rule out that universities of schools might soon bear Lukashenko's name.
""A while back, The Academy of Public Administration was given the addendum ‘of the President of the Republic of Belarus',"" she explained. ""Considering the widespread desire among civil servants to be promoted, educational establishments could soon also be named after Lukashenko.""

https://www.dw.com/en/serhou-guirassy-still-upstaging-harry-kane/a-66833808,SPORTS,Serhou Guirassy: Still upstaging Harry Kane 21.10.2023,"Harry Kane would be entitled to think averaging over a goal a game in the infancy of his Bundesliga career represents an exceptional return. But the Englishman at Bayern Munich is being outshone by an until-recently unheralded Guinean at Stuttgart. His opening goal in a 3 -0 win over freefalling Union Berlin on Saturday took Serhou Guirassy to an incredible 14 goals in his first eight league games.
No player in Bundesliga history has ever been this prolific at this stage of a season and only Cristiano Ronaldo, 15 in 2014-15 for Real Madrid, has scored more in the history of the five major European leagues (France, England, Germany, Spain, Italy).
Guirassy was prevented from matching Ronaldo by a muscle injury that forced his witdrawal in the first half of the match, but he'd done enough to put his side on the way to a sixth win in a row that takes them second.
Union coach Urs Fischer described Guirassy as ""a difference maker"" ahead of the game and was proved right. The striker's own coach was equally glowing of his character. ""He is a very, very modest, humble and even-tempered guy,"" Sebastian Hoeness said. ""So I don't see any danger [of over-confidence] there. Still, it's human that that does something to you. I don't see that with him right now.""
Though his rise to such a level of fame may be rapid, Guirassy served notice that such a spell might be possible with a run of form that kept Stuttgart up last term. The French-born striker, 27, scored four in his last five league games and one in the relegation playoff against Hamburg to help keep VfB in the Bundesliga. That further convinced Hoeness, whose arrival as coach is a key factor in Guirassy's form, to make his move from Rennes permanent.
""I benefit from the team, I'm grateful because it is a pleasure to play here with amazing fans. It is a great city,"" Guirassy said earlier this month. ""We have to stay humble like we are and work hard.""
Guirassy was born in Arles, on France's south coast, and his early career was spent in playing for Laval, Lille and Auxerre (on loan) before his first Bundesliga move to Cologne in 2016. Though he was young, at 20, Guirassy would doubtlessly have hoped for more than 79 minutes in his debut campaign in Germany. But a mix of injuries and problems settling prevented him making any impact.
Things didn't get much better in his second season in the west of Germany, with Cologne relegated. But Guirassy at least showed a glimpse of his promise, scoring all four of his league goals in a mid-season purple patch that also included a memorable winner over Arsenal in the Europa League.
A mediocre season in the 2.Bundesliga didn't prevent French top division side Rennes taking a chance on a striker who is tall, strong and mobile enough to play as a lone frontman and assured enough on the ball to operate as one of a front two or three.
""He has played a big part in bringing the team together and also knows that he can rely on his teammates,"" Stuttgart's sporting director, Fabian Wohlgemuth, told Sky after the Mainz game earlier in the season, where Guirassy took all three goals with the coolness and confidence that such a goalscoring run brings.
It's been in Stuttgart, and under the guidance of Hoeness where Guirassy has really delivered on the promise that saw him represent France at youth level. At senior level though, Guirassy has chosen to represent Guinea, the land of his parents.
As a former French colony, Guinea draw many of their players from the French leagues but also have a smattering of Bundesliga representation in the form of Naby Keita (Werder Bremen), and Ilaix Moriba (RB Leipzig). Guirassy's switch of international allegiance in 2022 has paid off quickly, with Guinea qualifying for this year's Africa Cup of Nations behind Egypt in Group D.
That tournament, in Ivory Coast in January, will likely see Guirassy miss several Stuttgart games. But, given that it will also be the transfer window in Europe, might also have an advantage. Guirassy reportedly drew interest from a number of clubs in England's Premier League before this season begun and a start like this certainly won't have dulled that interest.
""Serhou knows what he has here. He identifies 100% with our cause,"" said Hoeness earlier in the season, while Guirassy said he feels ""comfortable"" with the Bundesliga's surprise package. That's certainly not a word any of the defenders who face him would use.

https://www.dw.com/en/thailand-russia-relations-remain-strong-but-at-what-cost/a-67159703,POLITICS,"Thailand-Russia relations remain strong, but at what cost? 21.10.2023","Despite the West's best efforts to isolate Russia on the international stage following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow still enjoys warm relations with countries in Asia — Thailand being among them.
This past week, at the Belt and Road summit in Beijing, Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin hailed Thailand and Russia's ""long-standing close relationship"" after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Srettha posted about his first meeting with Putin as Thai PM on X, formerly known as Twitter. Both discussed increasing trade and cultural ties, he said, and Putin accepted Srettha's invitation to visit Thailand next year.
Experts say Srettha, who is a real estate tycoon, is just focusing on business.
""To boost the Thai economy to like 4%, and above, you need some foreign exchange. You need some customers. I think it's not like he's turned to Putin at the expense of the West. He wants to do both,"" Thitinan Pondsudhirak, a political analyst in Bangkok, told DW.
""While the social media backlash has taken the shine off his recent visit with Putin at the BRI Forum, Srettha cannot afford to be limited by optics only,"" said Mark S. Cogan, Associate Professor of Peace and Conflict Studies at Kansai University, Japan.
""Thailand is still heavily tourism dependent, and while not as much so as it is on Chinese tourism, Russian attraction and investment in Thailand cannot be ignored,"" he said.
Thailand has continued doing business with the Russia despite Moscow facing Western sanctions and political isolation following its February 24, 2022, invasion of Ukraine. Bangkok abstained from a UN vote to condemn Russia for its so-called annexation of four territories in Ukraine, too. Complicating matters further is the fact that Putin is also wanted by the International Criminal Court with The Hague having issued an arrest warrant in March of this year, ""in the context of the situation in Ukraine.""

The Beijing meeting between the two leaders came right after Bangkok announced it would extend the length of time Russian tourists can stay in the kingdom. From November 1, Russian visitors will be allowed to stay in Thailand for 90 days — up from 30 — with the scheme effective on a temporary basis until April 30. Thailand hopes the move will boost its economy.
Gary Bowerman, a tourism analyst based in Malaysia, says the decision ""makes sense.""
""Thailand hopes that by extending the welcome, more Russian tourists will spend more time exploring more of the country,"" he said.
Thailand has long been a popular holiday destination for Russian tourists. According to Thailand's Ministry of Sport and Tourism, nearly one million arrivals had already entered the Southeast Asian country by October 1. This means Russian tourists rank fifth among international visitors to enter the country this year. Authorities expect that number to grow to two million Russian visitors in 2024.
""It's not just the one million or more Russians that visit Phuket or other exotic destinations, but the real estate investments that in some ways stabilize tourism in Thailand by creating Russian enclaves in select neighborhoods, like Russian restaurants and other cultural familiarities,"" Cogan added.
As for trade, Russia is Thailand's 30th largest partner. Exports to Russia include vehicles, machinery, electronics, vegetables and fruit. Imports include oil, fertilizer and steel. Last year, Moscow pledged to increase bilateral trade with Thailand to $10 billion (€9.44 billion).
Titipol Phakdeewanich, a political scientist at Ubon Ratchathani University, says Thai-Russian relations don't appear to be changing under Srettha Thavisin, compared with his predecessors.
""I don't just look at Prayut [Chan-o-Cha], but I also look at Thaksin [Shinawatra] as well, because you know, Pheu Thai is Thaksin's Party... he had good relations with Russia. Thavisin, perhaps, is not much different from Prayut when he was in power, because Thailand didn't make any comments on the Ukraine situation.""
Srettha has been keen to boost Thailand's economy, one of the main campaign issues during the country's general election in May. But the Pheu Thai party's reputation took a hit from its supporters after forming a coalition that included pro-military parties in order to form a government.
""He only just thinks of economic policy and that is because that is the ticket that Pheu Thai is hoping to use to gain more popularity and change its reputation. If the economy is doing well, then they would have more opportunities to gain more seats in the next election,"" Titipol said.
To that end, Pheu Thai has also pledged to handout $10,000 Thai Baht (€259, $274) in digital money to every Thai citizen over 16-years of age. With a population of over 70 million, of which more than three-quarters fit into that age bracket, the move could prove costly.
""There is a big question about the source of money for their populist policies,"" Titipol said.

Allowing for more Russian tourism and investment is one way of producing further income for Thailand. ""By doing everything to show that they are also trying to generate more revenues for the government,"" Titipol said.
But with Russia's international reputation tarnished because of its war in Ukraine, Srettha cozying up to Putin may also come at a reputational cost, the political scientist added.
""I don't think this is good for Thailand's reputation as a supporter of democracy and human rights. And it will also destroy the reputation of his [Srettha's] government. He had a choice not to have that picture with Putin, but then it was his choice to actually show it. He doesn't really care about reputation and also indicated he doesn't quite understand geopolitics and how to actually balance and improve Thailand's reputation.""

https://www.dw.com/en/what-do-sporting-upsets-tell-us-about-why-we-love-sports/a-67161330,SPORTS,What do sporting upsets tell us about why we love sports? 20.10.2023,"On the face of it, the Netherlands' victory over South Africa at the Cricket World Cup in India was just another result from just another sport.
In the modern era of professional sports, the endless list of matches and competitions being contested across the world can mean results become just another post to scroll past on social media timelines everywhere. The meaning of another result does not extend beyond the impact it has on the win or loss column, before attention switches to the next game.
But we're missing the best part, because results such as these are worth savoring. A victory for the lowest-ranked team at a tournament against a traditional behemoth of a sport is a rarity in any discipline, let alone at a World Cup, and even less so in cricket.
That the Dutch win over the South Africans came just days after the second-lowest ranked team, Afghanistan, beat defending champions England, is even more remarkable.
All sporting upsets have their own remarkable background, and the Afghan triumph was no different.
In the face of political turmoil back home following the Taliban's return to power in 2021, Afghanistan's sports teams have faced an uphill battle to compete. The women's cricket team has been disbanded, female Afghan athletes at the recent Asian Games were all based abroad. And not long after the men's Cricket World Cup had started, the country experienced a 6.3 magnitude earthquake and after-tremors that claimed at least 1,000 lives.
Man of the match, bowler Mujeeb Ur Rahman, dedicated the victory to those who had been affected.
But for cricket fans not already cheering Afghanistan, what does their victory mean? Is it possible to find meaning beyond the individual context of each team?
Daniel Wann of Murray State University in Kentucky, USA, is one of the few experts in the psychology of fan support. Speaking to Eric Simons in the Colombia Journalism Review, Wann revealed eight motivations behind people's love of sport: self-esteem benefits, money might be involved, friends or family like sports, excitement, visually pleasing, escape from the real world, a sense of belonging and a place for emotional expression.
Ultimately, as Simons points out: ""There is no single answer to why people watch sports, because the answer doesn't lie in the game, it lies inside the individual.""
The mirror neurons in our brains that allow us to put ourselves in other people's shoes also play a role in how we watch sports, but they do not account for why you might favor one team over another.
But the interest around the underdog, the upset, the unexpected, is perhaps easier to explain more broadly. From the rewarding feeling of watching a team do something they don't do often (namely win) to subconscious Schadenfreude, many theories have been discussed and researched as to why people enjoy cheering on an underdog.
Nadav Goldschmied, Associate Professor of Psychological Sciences at the University of San Diego, believes the most compelling argument is a desire for fairness.
""I think that we intuitively assign the underdog, the lesser resources, the lesser opportunities, so when a label is assigned, like an underdog and a favorite, we immediately also assume that side from the relationship. We think that the underdogs did not have the same opportunities, and I think that we have kind of a sense of fairness to lend our support and try to make the world a more fair place,"" Goldschmied said in an interview with the award-winning student newspaper, The Science Survey.
Admittedly, in many modern sports, fairness is a concept that is becoming harder to believe in. In English football, for example, ownership in a capitalist economy has tilted the scales in favor of a handful of teams and opened a side door to political power, the combination of which leaves little room for underdogs or upsets.
Opposition to the proposed European Super League in 2001 was based partly on objection to the idea of a closed shop for the biggest names only.
The governing body of rugby, World Rugby, gives disproportionate amounts of funding to its members, leaving the established elite playing a different game than the rest.
A similar story is true in cricket, and the top-heavy nature of tennis means many pros struggle to make it to the courts in a competitive state.
That's why the victories of the Netherlands and Afghanistan matter more than ever. In some small way, they make us feel like a little fairness has been dealt out in a sporting landscape that is increasingly uneven.
Perhaps more than anything though, they remind us why watching sport is so compelling: because you still never know who is going to win.

She is the first female driver to join the British team's development program, and she will represent McLaren on the 2024 F1 Academy grid and run their livery.
""This is such an unreal moment in my career. To sign with McLaren and ART Grand Prix is way beyond anything I could've ever imagined growing up racing karts in the Philippines,"" Bustamante said in a statement on McLaren's website.
""I still have a hard time seeing my name next to McLaren without getting emotional, as the history and heritage linked to this team leaves me truly speechless.""
In May 2023, Bustamante won her first race in the F1 Academy, winning the second of three races in Valencia.
""When I won, it was like the whole world suddenly exploded,"" Bustamante told DW in June.
The 18-year-old received a message from the president of the Philippines, had a resolution voiced on the country's senate floor and saw her face splashed across an enormous billboard on the busiest street in Manila.
""I honestly didn't know how to react. I wasn't expecting the effect would be this much. It was really a crazy moment for me. To experience all this stuff at 18, sometimes I think it's a bit too much,"" she said.
It would be easy to dismiss this response as classic athlete hyperbole, but Bustamante's journey to this point explains why the tears flowed, and the country celebrated when the teenager stood on the podium.
Her father, a motorsport fanatic, bought Bustamante her first suit when she was just 1. She was in a baby race cart by age three, and at just six years old, Bustamante knew a life in motorsport was what she wanted.
""Financially, it definitely wasn't easy for us. You know, coming from the Philippines, we're a very middle-class family. My dad is actually an overseas worker. He moved away when I was young just so he could support the family and put food on the table,"" she said.
""The fact that I was racing, it was really, really difficult for the whole family. We made a lot of sacrifices, sometimes you might say too many. That's why I've always felt like I've had to pay them back.""
Many aiming to be in professional sports say failure isn't an option, and yet, for one of myriad reasons that make being a professional athlete so hard, never make it. Like them, Bustamante never had a prom or sleepovers and has been home-schooled for most of her life. A lot of what makes a typical childhood has been missing.
""Five, seven years ago, we were just struggling to even pay for the entry fee, fuel, tires. It made for a difficult road, and because of that, I needed to really value every time I was just able to drive, to race because I never really knew when it would be the last time.""
Life hasn't been easy for Bustamante, but one mantra has helped her through: ""When life's tough, you've got to be tougher.""
That approach has helped her go from karting glory as a child to the top rookie in the W Series [an all-female single-seater championship] last year. In 2023, she is set to finish in the top 7 of the 2023 F1 Academy racing for Prema Racing — the starting point for many F1 talents such as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.
To be here is a testament to Bustamante's determination, but even now, on the biggest stage, home remains a long way away. ""Other drivers have a home to go to after the race, but for me, home is a bit too far, so I'm often by myself,"" she told DW.
""There's a lot of moments where you kind of have a crash. You have so much adrenaline during a race weekend, and then suddenly, you're back to being by yourself. It's one of the struggles.""
It's a poignant reminder of the mental fortitude needed when competing at the highest level. Family support helps, perhaps none more so than the bond she shares with her brother.
""I have a brother, and he has autism and Down syndrome. I think having him really taught me how to not only think of myself but to be very selfless with a lot of things because, with him, I've always had to be selfless with moments where I needed to be very patient, forgiving when he would throw tantrums,"" Bustamante said, adding that after her win in Valencia, her brother was one of the first people she called.
""And I think that's why I've always been really, really patient with life, dealing with difficulties, losing, progress, patience just with everything. With that comes a lot of maturity. To not act on your emotions, or what's around you or in the moment, it really takes a lot of self-control and discipline.""
It's no surprise that her end goal is to join the biggest show in motorsport.
""The end goal for me is making it to Formula One. That's my Everest,"" Bustamante told DW. ""Everything I'm doing is to hopefully make it there.""
Last year at Hungaroring, Bustamante got a taste of the big show when she met seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton. The two bonded over the similarities of their journeys, two aspiring drivers who didn't look like anyone on the grid. For the teenager, the meeting was ""a moment she'll always cherish,"" and she credits Hamilton as one of the original supporters of the existence of the F1 Academy.
""Lewis has always supported women in motorsport. He was one of the first few people who really stood up for it and said: 'We need to have an initiative to support women.' Looking back five years ago, there wasn't even an initiative for women in the sport,"" she said.
""The fact that now, it's not just about us drivers, but even engineers like McLaren launching their new women program for STEM engineers — that's amazing,"" Bustamante said, referring to the science, technology, engineering and math courses that lay the foundation for a career in motorsport. The teenager has herself specialized in STEM and was, as of early June, on the verge of graduating.
By securing a deal with McLaren, Bustamante has not just taken a huge step towards realizing her goal of being on the F1 grid at some point in the future, but she's also paved the way for women in motorsports and in the Philippines. Bustamante is just getting started, and the teenager has a lot more to do, including hopefully making more phone calls to her brother after a race win.

https://www.dw.com/en/pan-american-games-all-you-need-to-know/a-67119095,SPORTS,Pan American Games: All you need to know 19.10.2023,"The 2023 Pan American Games and ParaPan American Games will be the first ever edition in Santiago, Chile. It's the 19th edition of an event that first began in 1951 in Argentina, although this will be just the seventh edition for Para athletes.
Chile is hosting for the Games for the first time and it's set to be the largest multi-sport event ever in the country, which also hosted the seventh World Cup back in 1962.
The event, which will run from October 20 until November 5, is often seen as a dress rehearsal for the Olympics because it is always held the year before the world's major international multi-sport event.
Santiago will host 8,000 athletes from 41 nations competing across 56 sports. The USA will be sending the largest contingent, with 631 athletes expected, 93 of whom are Olympians. Athletes from Brazil, Argentina, Canada and Mexico are expected in large numbers, but the event gives athletes from smaller nations such as the Bahamas, Grenada and Suriname the chance to go for glory, too.
With over 100 direct quotas for Paris 2024 on offer, the Pan American Games are much more than just a chance to compete for some athletes.
This year, skateboarding, breaking, and sport climbing will make their debut at the games.
Sport climbing and skateboarding debuted at 2020 Olympics in Tokyo and will return in Paris in 2024, but their arrival at the Pan American Games gives a raft of new athletes the chance to compete at the highest level.
Breaking, also known as break dancing, will make its debut at the Olympics in Paris in 2024 after a successful outing at the Youth Olympic Games in 2018. In Santiago, all eyes will be trained on athletes being judged on their creativity, personality, technique, variety, performance and music. A total of 32 athletes will compete to qualify — 16 boys and 16 girls — in dance battles against once another. Both gold medalists will qualify for the 2024 Olympics in Paris.
Elsewhere, artistic roller skating will get an outing in Santiago and synchronized trampolining will be contested for the first time ever.
Did you know that Michael Jordan played in the competition before he had even been drafted into the NBA, playing for the US in 1983?
This time around, the US has declined to submit a 5x5 basketball team but that doesn't mean there aren't any stars on show.
Brazil's leading gymnast Rebeca Andrade is fresh off a gold medal in the vault at the World Championships in Antwerp and returns to her home continent to compete.
Andrade, the first Brazilian female gymnast to win a medal at an Olympic Games, is widely considered one of the greatest gymnasts of the modern era. The 24-year-old won gold in the vault in Tokyo and, having missed out on the 2019 Pan American Games following a third anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee tear, leads the team hoping to beat the US to gold.
She will face stiff competition though, with 22-year-old Jordan Chiles headlining the US team in the absence of Simone Biles. Chiles won a silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics as a member of the US team and will be looking to go for glory at her first Pan American Games.
Perhaps the biggest name of the games though, is skateboarding superstar Rayssa Leal. The 15-year-old Brazilian won silver in Tokyo aged just 13, making her the youngest ever Olympian from her country and the youngest medalist in 85 years. Her success made her an overnight sensation and Leal hasn't looked back since, winning gold in this year's X Games.
Leal suffered a wrist injury in Switzerland last month but is hoping to show her 6.3 million Instagram followers and the world why she is the best street skaterboarder on the planet in the sport's competition debut.
With around a million people expected to attend the games over the course of 17 days, it is no surprise safety is a high priority.
One of the initiatives launched is a QR Code designed to keep women safe. The QR code will available to scan at both the Santiago International Airport and in the athletes' village. Doing so will bring up information on the prevention of gender violence as well as a list of relevant contact information.
Elsewhere, organizers will be distributing 100,000 condoms during the games, the majority of which will be delivered to the athlete's village and official hotels. While that is not nearly as many as were distributed during the Rio games (reportedly around 450,000, or 42 per athlete), the drive to promote safe sex among athletes and the population is clear.
Toronto did something similar when it hosted the Pan American Games back in 2015, distributing condoms in the hope of reinvigorating condom use in the city.
Indeed, Chile is well advised to do the same, given that a recent research paper by Manuel Armayones Ruiz published in the journal BMC Public Health, states, ""UNAIDS believes the country presents the highest incidence of STI/HIV in Latin America.""

https://www.dw.com/en/indonesia-corruption-scandals-escalate-as-election-nears/a-67130795,POLITICS,Indonesia: Corruption scandals escalate as election nears 18.10.2023,"Indonesia has been hit by a series of corruption scandals whereby several leading officials have been accused of wrongdoing.
The latest allegation came against the former Minister of Agriculture Syahrul Yasin Limpo. Earlier this month, the Indonesian Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) arrested Limpo in his apartment in south Jakarta for suspected corruption and extortion while in office. His case is still ongoing.
Limpo sparked public debate as he was scheduled to arrive in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, on October 1 after seeking medical treatment abroad. However, he had been missing for several days and returned after the Nasdam Party Chairman Surya Paloh urged him to come home.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo is in his second and final term. As a result, the southeast Asian country is expected to face a more competitive general election in 2024.
Besides Limpo, two ministers and one former minister have also been suspected of corruption in separate investigations. Indonesian Transport Minister Budi Karya Sumadi is being investigated as a witness of alleged bribery over railroad construction and maintenance.
Meanwhile, Sports and Youth Minister Dito Ariotedjo is said to have accepted 27 billion rupiah ($1.72 million, €1.62 million) in alleged bribery related to a 4G base transceiver station (BTS) project. He denied the allegation while on the witness stand in a corruption trial involving Former Minister of Communication and Information Technology Johnny G. Plate.
Plate's trial began in June 2023 and has been charged with alleged corruption over the construction of mobile phone transmission towers in remote parts of the country. His case is also still ongoing.
Zaenur Rohman, a researcher from the Gadjah Mada University Center for Anti-corruption Studies (Pukat UGM), said the recent scandals could be an indicator of poor due diligence from Widodo, who is more commonly known as Jokowi, during the recruitment process for ministerial candidates.
""There is no process for assessing the track record, background, and leadership of prospective ministers. Why? Because we prioritize more accommodating the needs of supporting parties and volunteers who supported the president. So the candidate's capacity, integrity and so on, is not being seen as a very important factor,"" Zaenur Rohman told DW.
In his second term, Jokowi is known to have accommodated people from many political views to work as his ministers, including his rival Prabowo Subianto. This has left his government with minor and often insignificant opposition.
Nevertheless, Rohman noted that political rivals may have played a role in the downfall of the accused.
""And that's a good thing. It is better for these elites to expose each other instead of covering up for each other,"" Rohman said.
The archipelagic country is scheduled to hold a general election in February 2024. Some 204 million eligible voters are set to choose their new president and vice president, as well as national and regional parliamentary members.

During Jokowi's presidency, four former ministers have already been convicted of corruption and put in jail.
In August 2021, former Indonesian Social Affairs Minister Juliari Batubara was sentenced to 12 years in prison over a multi-million-dollar COVID-19 graft scandal.
Former Minister of Youth and Sports Imam Nahrawi was sentenced to seven years in prison and a fine of 400 million rupiah in June 2020 after he was found guilty of corruption related to the provision of grants, as well as gratuities amounting to 8.3 billion rupiah.
Former Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Edhy Prabowo was found guilty of bribery related to lobster seed export permits and was sentenced to 5 years in prison in mid-2021. Meanwhile, in April 2019, former Minister of Social Affairs Idrus Marham was convicted of corruption for receiving bribes. He was sentenced to three years in jail and fined 150 million rupiah.
Wawan Heru Suyatmiko, deputy secretary-general of Transparency International Indonesia, believes the issue of corruption is systemic within Indonesian politics.
""There is something called political corruption, which is often denied or ignored as unimportant because it may not harm the country's finances, but this is important,"" he told DW.
He then cited the example of changing the law to legitimatize the desire for power for a group of people, or so-called autocratic legalism.
The Corruption Perception Index 2022 issued by Transparency International (TI) showed Indonesia's levels of corruption had worsened, leaving the country below Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand in the index.

https://www.dw.com/en/footballers-suspended-for-social-media-posts-on-israel-hamas-war/a-67133287,SOCCER,Footballers suspended for social media posts on Israel-Hamas war 18.10.2023,"Ligue 1 team Nice suspended Algerian international Youcef Atal on Wednesday after he shared a social media post linked to the war between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.
Atal reportedly shared a video from Palestinian preacher Mahmoud al-Hasanat, who asked God to ""send Jewish people a dark day.""
The post was quickly deleted, and the 27-year-old apologized, saying he would ""never support a message of hate"".
Nice said in a statement, though, that, given the seriousness of the post, the club would ""take immediate disciplinary action against the player, prior to any action that may be taken by sporting and legal authorities.""
At the start of the week, French prosecutors had launched a preliminary investigation into the Algerian on suspicion of ""glorifying terrorism.""
This news comes just a day after Bundesliga club Mainz suspended Dutchman Anwar El Ghazi for a pro-Palestinian social media post that allegedly including the statement: ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.""
The statement has been used to assert territorial claims over the borders of the Palestinian territories. Germany's public prosecutor's office recently told the German Press Agency that they now classify the sentence a criminal offense because they believe it to be potentially seditious regarding Israel's right to exist. 
While Germany's public prosecutor's office comments were in general and El Ghazi is not being investigated, Mainz still felt it had to act.
""El Ghazi took a position on the ongoing conflict in the Middle East that was deemed unacceptable by the club,"" the club said in a statement.
Beforehand, the club say they spoke to the player and that it respects the fact there are a variety of perspectives on the ""complex conflict in the Middle East"" but that it is ""distancing themselves from the content of the post"" because ""it does not align with the values of the club.""
The post has since been deleted.
Atal and El Ghazi are the first to be suspended by clubs for their posts, but not the first footballers to express themselves about the war.
Earlier this month, Bayern Munich and Morocco defenderNoussair Mazraoui shared a pro-Palestinian post. The defending Bundesliga champions are to set to speak to Mazraoui once he returns from international duty.

https://www.dw.com/en/football-juventus-star-fagioli-banned-for-gambling-offences/a-67126648,SPORTS,Football: Juventus star Fagioli banned for gambling offences 17.10.2023,"Italy and Juventus midfielder Nicolo Fagioli's season is all but over after the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) banned the 22-year-old for seven months for gambling offences.
Fagioli himself alerted the federation to bets he had placed on football matches, an illegal activity for professional footballers, and has been able to negotiate a more lenient punishment by admitting his guilt and co-operating with the authorities. Betting offences in professional football usually carry a minimum ban of three years.
Officially, Fagioli's ban is for 12 months, but five of those have been commuted into a ""treatment plan"" centered on combating gambling addiction, for which the player has already been seeing a therapist.
In addition to a €12,500 (roughly $13,200) fine, Fagioli will take part in ""at least 10 public meetings to be held within five months, at amateur sports associations and both local football federation and gambling addiction recovery centers,"" according to an FIGC program.
Fagioli, who has made one appearance for Italy, is a product of Juventus' youth academy and, after spending last season on loan at Serie B side Cremonese, has featured in the squad for all eight of Juventus' Serie A fixtures so far this season, including three starts and three substitute appearances.
But it will now be May before he returns to action, potentially for the last two games of the season, adding to a Juventus absentee list which already includes French star Paul Pogba, who is currently awaiting the verdict of an investigation after he failed a doping test earlier this month.

Meanwhile, two other Italian players, Sandro Tonali and Nicolo Zaniolo, were released from the European champions' training camp last week following questioning by state prosecutors as part of a criminal probe into the use of illegal gambling platforms allegedly linked to organized crime.
Zaniolo's lawyer told the Gazzetta dello Sport on Sunday that the Aston Villa forward has never gambled on football but that ""it's possible he played card games like poker and blackjack on illegal platforms.""
Tonali's agent admitted that the Newcastle United midfielder had an ""illness,"" saying: ""Sandro is shaken up by the situation, but he has already started to fight back. He's always been a fighter and now he's taken on his biggest challenge.""
There is no indication that either Fagiolo, Zaniolo or Tonali gambled on their own teams' matches, nor that they were involved in match fixing.
In 2006, Italian football was rocked by a major match-fixing scandal, dubbed Calciopoli, which resulted in Juventus being stripped of their 2004–05 Serie A title and relegated to Serie B.

https://www.dw.com/en/eu-bans-microplastics-added-to-consumer-products/a-67019552,NATURE AND ENVIRONMENT,EU bans microplastics added to consumer products 17.10.2023,"From the depths of ocean trenches to the peaks of the highest mountains, from our food and water to human blood and stool, there are few places microplastics have not been found. Indeed, the United Nations estimates there is more of it in our seas than there are stars in our galaxy. 
Spread through the air, water and soil, once microplastic is in the environment, it doesn't biodegrade and can't be removed, meaning it stays there for centuries, posing a threat to wildlife and ultimately making its way into the food chain and the human body.
Microplastics are used as abrasive particles in toothpaste or exfoliants, or as binders that change the consistency of liquids. Currently an estimated 42,000 tons of these tiny pieces of plastic, intentionally added to products, are released in the EU annually. Yet their effect on human health remains unknown.
""That's why it is so important to stop the stream of release into the environment,"" said Johanna Bernsel, spokesperson for the European Commission.
To tackle the issue, the EU's executive arm has adopted measures under European REACH legislation on harmful chemicals, banning the sale within the bloc of both microplastics themselves and products to which they have been intentionally added. 
The new ban, which covers all synthetic polymer particles less than five millimeters that are organic, insoluble and resist degradation, will impact a vast array of products including cosmetics, detergents, glitter, fertilizers, plant protection items, toys, medicines, medical devices and artificial sport surfaces.
Not affected are construction materials that contain microplastics but do not release them and products used at industrial sites. However, manufacturers will have to report their estimated microplastic emissions annually and will have to provide instructions on how to use and dispose of products to prevent microplastics escaping into the environment. 
The ban not only applies to products manufactured in the European Union but also to those imported from abroad.
""So in that sense, it promotes the innovativeness of the European industry,"" Bernsel said.
For cosmetics containing microbeads — small plastic beads used for exfoliation — and loose glitter made of plastic, the ban will take effect in mid-October. But for other cosmetics, there will be a transition period of between four and 12 years, depending on the complexity of the product and availability of suitable alternatives.
For infill material used in sport pitches, there will be a grace period of eight years to give pitch owners time to switch to alternatives and allow most existing pitches to reach their end of life, at which point they would need to be replaced anyway.
Marc Kreutzbruck, head of the Institute of Plastics Engineering at Germany's University of Stuttgart, said there's no substitute that can help us achieve our climate goals as effectively as plastic can.
""Unfortunately, that's the reality because plastics are a material that can be shaped at very low temperatures,"" he said. ""Regardless of the material, whether metal, ceramic, glass or anything else, they all require significantly more energy to be made into products.""
He said recycling and sustainability are the way forward.
""We need to achieve 100% recycling. Plastic is not disposable; it's a valuable material that needs to be collected and recycled. This mindset must be instilled in people,"" he said.

Another idea is to use biodegradable plastics which break down quickly when they enter the environment. But they currently only have a market share of around a fraction of a percent. What's more, Kreutzbruck added, they can't be used for all products, particularly complex ones like food packaging.
European Commission spokesperson Bernsel said it will require a concerted effort by policy makers, industry and the research community to come up with sustainable alternatives. She is optimistic the ban will provide the necessary incentives to do so.
""We believe the future of the chemicals industry is to emphasize sustainability and sustainable alternatives. So this is an opportunity for the European industry to be at the forefront of the development towards more sustainability and innovation. That's how we can keep our competitive edge,"" she said.
Under the Zero Pollution Action Plan, the EU has committed to a 30% reduction in microplastics waste by 2030. The ban is a first step toward that goal. 
It is expected that the ban will prevent the release of about half a million tons of microplastics into the environment, but Kreutzbruck said more needs to be done.
""It's important to understand that compared to the overall volume of plastic in the environment, microplastics in cosmetics comprise less than 1%. So while it's good that these measures are being taken, it only scratches the surface,"" he said.
Further steps could see the EU tackle microplastics that are unintentionally released, for instance, from clothes when they are washed or car tires.
Bernsel hopes the new regulation might inspire other regions in the world to consider taking action.
""Of course, we cannot dictate measures for other countries or regions in the world. But setting an example on environmental matters has proven very successful in other areas in the past,"" she said.

https://www.dw.com/en/ioc-congress-cricket-and-squash-get-the-nod-for-los-angeles-2028/a-67110528,SPORTS,IOC Congress: Cricket and squash get the nod for Los Angeles 2028 16.10.2023,"Among the five sports up for approval for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, cricket attracted the most attention, not just because it is the second most popular sport in the world after football, but because of where the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was holding its Congress, in Mumbai, the cricket-mad nation of India.
The vote for cricket was overwhelming, with just two of some 90 votes against. This marks the return of the sport that was only once previously a part of the Olympics, in Paris in 1900. The 2028 Games are to feature men's and women's six-team Twenty20 tournaments, the shortest form of the game.
Baseball and softball, lacrosse, flag football and squash are also to be added to the Olympic lineup for 2028, as proposed by the organizers of the LA Games.
Lacrosse, originally played by indigenous people in North America, is also making its return to the Olympics after an absence of more than a century – having been dropped after the 1908 London Games. Baseball and softball have been in and out of the Olympic program, with both having returned for the Tokyo Games in 2021.
Squash is set to make its debut at the Los Angeles Olympics, having failed in bids to be included in the four previous Summer Games.
Also completely new to the Olympics is flag football, a non-contact version of the full-contact game, which was a demonstration sport at the 1932 Olympics – when Los Angeles first hosted the Summer Games. The United States' wildly popular National Football League (NFL) is squarely behind the move.
""The NFL is committed to working together to strengthen flag football's place in the Olympic movement long term,"" the league's commissioner, Roger Goodell, said in a statement.
IOC President Thomas Bach didn't rule out staying on in the post after his term expires in 2025. Responding to calls by three IOC members for a change to the Olympic Charter to allow him to stay on, Bach thanked them for their ""kind words of support.""
The current 12-year term limit was adopted by the IOC in 1999 during a bribery scandal surrounding the awarding of the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City. Bach was first elected in 2013 and confirmed in office for a final four years in 2021. A motion to amend the Olympic Charter could be put to IOC members at the next congress, ahead of next summer's Paris Games.
The Congress in Mumbai also decided to award the hosting rights for the 2030 and 2034 Winter Games shortly before next summer's Olympics in Paris.
Just recently, the northern Japanese city of Sapporo abandoned its bid to host the 2030 Winter Games in light of bribery scandals surrounding the 2020 Olympic Games held in Tokyo in the summer of 2021. Sapporo, the host of the 1972 Winter Games, is now considering a bid for 2034 or later. 2010 Winter Games host Vancouver has also withdrawn after the British Columbia provincial government announced that it would not support the bid.
Possible contenders for 2030 could include bids from France, Sweden and Switzerland. Due to the 2028 Summer Games being hosted by LA, 2030 is thought to be too early for Salt Lake City. However, the 2002 hosts look to be in the driver's seat for 2034, as so far, no other city or region has expressed interest.
Prior to its decision, the IOC had pointed to the implications of climate change for future editions of the Winter Olympics. The selection commission presented two studies. According to the studies, by 2040, just 10 countries worldwide will still be able to host the snow competitions at the Olympics and the Paralympics. Therefore, the IOC is discussing a possible rotation system among this small group as well as changes to the future makeup of the competition program.
The 2026 Winter Games, to be hosted by Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy, are set to make history — but not how they probably would have wanted. Giovanni Malago, head of the organizing committee, told the delegates in Mumbai that the bobsleigh, luge and skeleton competitions would be held outside Italy. This, he said, was due to an estimated doubling of costs for constructing the Cortina track to €80 million ($84 million). He said a venue outside of Italy had been identified as suitable but declined to name it as it had not yet been approved by the organizing committee.
The Austrian town of Innsbruck, which hosted the 1964 and 1976 Winter Games, is one of the closest possible alternatives. This will be the first time in the 102-year history of the Winter Games that competitions will be held outside the host country.

https://www.dw.com/en/bayern-munich-defender-posts-pro-palestinian-video/a-67104478,SOCCER,Bayern Munich defender posts pro-Palestinian video 15.10.2023,"Bayern Munich defender Noussair Mazraoui reportedly shared a video on Instagram in which he wished ""victory"" to the Palestinians in the conflict with Israel. 
In his post, the Moroccan national player shared a short clip featuring the image of a waving Palestinian flag accompanied by a prayer-like voiceover saying: ""God help our persecuted brothers in Palestine, so that they attain victory. May God have mercy on the dead, may God heal their wounded.""
Mazraoui shared the post with the word Ameen (Amen) and a praying hands emoji.
On Monday, Bayern Munich said their management planned to speak to the player about the posts.
""Bayern immediately contacted Noussair Mazraoui after his Instagram posts on Sunday,"" the club told the DPA news agency. ""After his return (from national team duty), a detailed personal meeting with the club's management in Munich is planned.""
Mazraoui is currently on the road with the Moroccan national team, which played Ivory Coast on Saturday and was to face Liberia on Tuesday. Another Instagram post shared by Mazraoui features stories from four Moroccan teammates — the Bayern defender himself, plus Hakim Ziyech (Galatasaray), Zakaria Aboukhlal (FC Toulouse), and former SC Paderborn midfielder Abdelhamid Sabiri (who currently plays for Saudi Pro club Al-Fayha FC).
The accompanying text read: ""Moroccan NT (national team) players Aboukhlal, Ziyech, Mazraoui & Sabiri have all posted stories in support of Palestine, but you can only see the stories if you go to their profile. They're trying to silence us. It's literally us against the world!"" All four shared the post on their own Instagram pages.
However, the 25-year-old later sent an additional post clarifying his previous messages, saying, ""First of all, I would like to say it's really disappointing that I have to explain what I stand for. There's a situation out there where thousands of innocent people are being murdered.
""My position is that I will work for peace and justice in this world. This means that I will always be against all kinds of terrorism, hatred and violence. And that’s something I will always stand behind.
""That's why I don't understand why people think the opposite about me and why I'm associated with hateful groups. Today is not about what I think or what you think, innocent people are being killed every day by this terrible conflict that has gotten out of hand. We all need to be against it and speak out against it. This is just inhumane.
""Finally, I would like to make it clear that it was never my intention to offend or hurt anyone, consciously or unconsciously""
Last weekend, Israel was attacked by the miiltant group Hamas — which Israel, the EU, US, Germany and other countries designate a terrorist organization. Since then, more than 1,300 Israelis have been killed. Palestinian officials say Israeli counterattacks have killed more than 2,400 in the Gaza Strip.
Shortly after reports of the attack emerged, Bayern Munich wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the team was ""worried about our friends in Israel."" Munich's backup goalkeeper Daniel Peretz is Israeli and has shared emotional messages on Instagram in which he calls on athletes to speak out against terrorism.
Much social media discussion about Mazraoui's post has focused on how it should be interpreted — with some users speaking up for the Moroccan, even agreeing with him, and others calling for him to be fired immediately.
Mazraoui came to Munich from Ajax in 2022 and is under contract until 2026. Should the perennial Bundesliga champions find it necessary to suspend or even fire the young Moroccan, it would put further strain on its overtaxed defensive unit.
Though Bayern signed central defender Kim Min-jae from Napoli before the season, the club began the season with a defender less after the departures of Lucas Hernandez to Paris Saint-Germain and Benjamin Pavard to Inter Milan. Bayern also sent right-back Josip Stanisic on a season-long loan to Bayer Leverkusen, who currently sit atop the Bundesliga.
There has been talk of re-signing free agent Jerome Boateng. Recent discussions about signing the 2014 World Cup winner at other junctures have all gone against him — either for sporting reasons, or because, like now, Boateng will once again be going on trial for battery.

""India will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to organize the Olympics in India in 2036. This is an age-old dream of [1.4 billion] Indians, it is their aspiration,"" Modi said.
""We want to realize this dream with your collaboration and support... I am confident that India will get the support of the IOC.""
India has never hosted the Olympics before. New Delhi hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2010.
Modi made no mention in Mumbai of which Indian city might apply for the Games.
Indian news media say Ahmedabad, the largest city in Gujarat, might bid. Gujarat is Modi's home state. Ahmedabad is also home to Narendra Modi Stadium, the world's largest sporting venue measured by seating capactiy.
Paris will host the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games between July and August, followed by Los Angeles in 2028. Brisbane will host the 2032 Games.
Unlike similarly populous China, India is yet to establish itself as a perennial contender near the top of Olympic medal races. Astonishingly, the country has claimed just 10 gold medals in its Olympic history, and 35 medals in all. 
However, interest in the Games is increasing, as was best demonstrated by Neeraj Chopra winning gold at the Tokyo Games in the javelin, prompting a hero's welcome on his return home and various artistic endeavors to celeberate his achievement. 
 
The IOC executive board is meeting in Mumbai, ahead of the IOC session between October 15 and 17. 
The session is a big deal because all important decisions to run future games are approved during it. India hosted its first and last IOC session in 1983.
On October 15, the session is expected to approve the inclusion of cricket and four other games as part of 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.
Each host city, under IOC rules approved a few years ago, can request the inclusion of several sports for their edition of the Games.
Organizers of the Los Angeles 2028 Games said this week they wanted cricket, flag football, lacrosse, squash and baseball-softball added to the event.
Cricket's addition surely helped play some role in mobilizing Modi to seek the Games. He announced his country's ambitions amid India's symoblically charged victory over Pakistan in the Cricket World Cup.
Modi said India would also look to host the Youth Olympics in 2029. ""Sports is not just about winning medals but also winning hearts,"" he said.
Poland has so far expressed interesting in joining the bid to host the Olympics in 2036, while Indonesia and Mexico might also join the race to host the 2036 Games.

https://www.dw.com/en/poland-election-what-do-businesses-supporting-the-countrys-pink-economy-expect/a-67010429,POLITICS,Poland election: What do businesses supporting the country's pink economy expect? 14.10.2023,"Poland's capital, Warsaw, has become a center for multinational companies and global investment banks to set up offices, as the country aims to become Central Europe's financial hub.
But, a few streets away from the bustle of Warsaw's business district, in the basement of a residential building, Sebastian Wareluk's sewing machine whirs constantly.
Wareluk and his partner, Wojciech Ostrowski, are the owners of backpack company Dwa Borsuki. While they make a range of bags for big companies like haircare brand Garnier, their business also has a sizeable clientele from Poland's LGBTQ community. 
""We started this business about four and a half years ago with an aim to make colorful backpacks. We're also a gay couple and don't want to hide our identity, so we started focusing on making rainbow bags and backpacks that cater to customers from the LGBTQ+ community or anyone who supports the community in Poland,"" Ostrowski told DW.
The rights of people from the LGBTQ community in Poland have been threatened in recent years by the anti-LGBTQ narrative of the country's ruling Law and Justice party (PiS).
Two years ago, several communities in the country declared themselves to be ""LGBTQ ideology free zones."" However, some places have rescinded this status after the EU condemned such discrimination.
Despite these challenges, businesses like Dwa Boruski haven't shied away from catering to the community or realizing the potential of Poland's ""pink money,"" a term for the purchasing power of the LGBTQ community.
Ian Johnson, chief executive of Out Now, a global marketing firm that specializes in LGBTQ research and marketing, told DW that among the 10 largest EU economies, Poland's ""pink economy"" is ranked seventh and accounts for almost 165 billion zloty (€36 billion; $38.2 billion) a year.
""Given that 'pink money' represents the combined incomes earned by Poland's almost two million LGBTQ adults — and that these consumers are responsible for earnings of almost €36 billion each year — it's logical that businesses would be interested in building an advantageous position to attract more of this income,"" Johnson added.
From big multinational companies like ice cream brand Ben & Jerry's, which made a rainbow hologram to support LGBTQ rights, to Wareluk and Ostrowkski's small business, the potential of Poland's ""pink money"" has been an incentive to continue catering to the community, despite politics.
But Ostrowkski says that their business is also about attracting clientele who support the LGBTQ community. Dwa Borsuki customers even get a rebate if they show they've made a donation to an LGBTQ organization.

An hour and a half away from Warsaw, in the former textile manufacturing city of Lodz, Waclaw Miklaszewski, the co-founder of Kubota, a Polish flip-flop brand that also supports the LGBTQ community, shares a similar view.
""We don't wait for the government to understand these things because society understands things much faster. It was just normal for us to support the LGBTQ community in Poland,"" Miklaszewski told DW.
Kubota's colorful flip-flops have been famous in Poland since the mid-1990s. Now they have a turnover of over €6 million per year and listed on the Polish stock exchange last year.
Miklaszewski says that as a public company, supporting the LGBTQ community is not only about sporting the rainbow logo. ""It's also about practicing support in every product that is a part of our rainbow collection,"" he said. ""We do so by giving quite a big amount of income generated from these products to the NGOs that support the LGBTQ movement.""
While businesses like Kubota and Dwa Borsuki remain outspoken about supporting the LGBTQ community, not everyone in Poland has come to terms with it. 
""My mother stopped talking to me when she heard about who our business caters to. She supports the Law and Justice party and their ideologies,"" Ostrowski said, adding that in small towns and villages, such feelings are common.
A young Polish woman on the streets of Warsaw told DW that while the current government or any new government has to make choices based on politics and economics, people can still make a difference.
""We have a choice as people to support the LGBTQ community and their business and help our economy grow. I personally like simple colors and not rainbow colors so won't buy rainbow products. But I have no issue supporting the businesses,"" she said.
Poland heads to the polls on October 15. Migration, women's and LGBTQ rights, and the war in Ukraine are among the major campaign topics.
While the pink economy contributes about 5% of Poland's nearly €700 billion in annual GDP, Ostrowski thinks that as long as a business brings in money governments are happy.
Meanwhile, Piotr Arak, director of the Polish Economic Institute, told DW that it is wiser for politics to simply stay out of the economy. To make a country thrive they should just create regulations that enable individuals and businesses to grow.
But Out Now's Johnson argues that Polish politicians should care about the pink economy, because LGBTQ voters comprise almost 2 million votes in total, a figure that can be important in a tight contest.
""We anticipate that political candidates choosing to demonstrate support for equal treatment of LGBTQ people should expect to find the 2023 electoral landscape much more favorable than during the 2019 national parliamentary election, when support for LGBTQ people across Polish society was far less widespread,"" Johnson said.
Meanwhile, for flip-flop maker Kubota, the results of the upcoming election aren't going to stop their LGBTQ support.
""Elections or no elections, as a business we're here to support the LGBTQ community. There is no place for confrontation. If any politician is against it, we'll just send them our flip-flops and some flowers,"" Miklaszewski said.

https://www.dw.com/en/jewish-communities-in-germany-we-are-afraid/a-67094833,SOCIETY,Jewish communities in Germany: 'We are afraid' 14.10.2023,"Esther K., a real estate agent based in Berlin, who prefers not to share her real name, says she will never forget the moment she got a text message from a friend on Saturday morning reading: ""Look what's going on in Israel.""
K's first thought was: ""We're all used to something happening in this crazy little country."" But then she read the news that the Islamist militant group Hamas had unexpectedly attacked Israel from Gaza and armed fighters were advancing into the country by land, sea and air, killing people and taking hostages. Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by the US, EU and others.
Her cellphone was suddenly flooded with photos from Israel and calls for help from people asking for assistance in finding relatives who had disappeared. 
Esther K. says she has felt nothing but a black void since.
""The bodies of parents who were shot dead, next to the dead bodies of their children, video games on the Playstations still running ... those are images I can't forget,"" K. says.
Like many others, she said she stared at her phone and thought, ""what is this? What is this? Where is the military?"" 
Along with having one of the strongest armies in the world, Israel is secured by the Mossad intelligence service and Iron Dome missile defense system.
Leo Latasch, a board member and head of security for Frankfurt's Jewish community organization, is one of the many people stunned as to why the terrorist attack was not discovered in time. 
From afar, the medic watched helplessly as Israelis tried to save lives without any military protection.
""I don't know how this will end. We don't know how many more people will die,"" Latasch says in reference to Israel's possible ground offensive in Gaza. 

It is seen as especially significant that more than 100,000 Jews reside in Germany today, and that Jewish life — with its festivals, customs, schools and sports clubs — is possible just decades after 6 million Jews were killed at the hands of German Nazis during the Holocaust.
Still many Jewish institutions have reinforced secuirty, with police guards and protective fences. 
""There has been an increased security level for our facilities for quite some time,"" the spokesman for Berlin's Jewish community organization Ilan Kiesling told DW in an email.
""Since the 1970s, for example, our community members have become accustomed to community life taking place behind protective fences and monitored by surveillance cameras. Due in no small part to the alarming rise in attacks on Jewish institutions and individuals across Europe, we continue to be compelled to provide a high level of protection for our members and facilities."" 
For a long time now, large portions of Jewish community organizations' budgets have been devoted to security. Most have their own security departments, working closely with police and state criminal investigation departments. 
But now, after the attacks on Israel by Hamas, which Germany, the US and other countries consider a terrorist organization, many Jews have lost faith in those security measures. 
""The parents are scared, just scared,"" a staff member at a Jewish daycare center in Berlin told DW. In many Jewish kindergartens, children stayed home this week. 
Leo Latasch has been in charge of security for the Jewish community in Frankfurt for 37 years.
He said he has been trying to reassure parents, explaining again and again that the conflict is taking place in Israel, not Frankfurt. He says he is advising them not to panic at every — possibly fake — news report.
But he is finding it harder and harder to reassure them. ""We've never been in a situation like this before,"" Latasch says.  
The Islamist terrorist group Hamas has been seeking to mobilize the Arab and Muslim world for protests. Latasch says he doesn't blame Jewish parents if they prefer to keep their children close to them during this time. 
Antisemitism, however, is by no means only an Arab-Muslim problem in Germany. In 2022, the American Jewish Committee (AJC) commissioned a representative study by the Allensbach Institute for Demography looking into attitudes of the population as a whole. The survey showed that antisemitism is not exclusively a problem of the political fringes, but ""deeply rooted"" in the middle of society.
This is a very real threat to all Jews in Germany, says founding executive director of the OFEKcounseling center and head of the Competence Center for Antisemitism, Marina Chernivsky.
She says Jews in Germany are currently facing a twofold burden. On the one hand, there is the deep-rooted antisemitism in Germany, which is a very real threat, she said. In addition, she added, ""they are experiencing the most massive violence against the civilian population in Israel since the Shoah. This is re-triggering a deep-seated trauma. And they now have to deal with that too."" 
Since the attacks, the OFEK counseling center in Germany has been very busy. There has been a sharp increase in the number of people calling its crisis hotline for advice. Some include parents trying to understand how to talk to their children about war. 

When Russia attacked Ukraine, Esther K. was one of the helpers organizing clothing and housing for the Ukrainian refugees. Now, she has been trying to quickly find accommodation for Israelis stranded in Germany since the suspension of air traffic with Israel. Many are women with children. 
However, only one elderly lady responded to K's request for help.
""For the Germans, this is just one more disaster in the world,"" she says. She said she feels disappointed and completely alone in Germany.
When members of Samidoun — a front for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) group, widely considered a terrorist organization — distributed sweets in Berlin-Neukölln in apparent celebration of the Hamas terrorist attacks, Berlin's Jewish community in Berlin demanded the group be banned. 
""We don't want to see such images in Berlin anymore,"" Ilan Kiesling stressed. 
On Thursday, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced bans on Hamas-affiliated activities in Germany and a ban on the Samidoun association.

https://www.dw.com/en/ioc-congress-in-mumbai-to-decide-fate-of-five-hopeful-sports/a-67086554,SPORTS,IOC Congress in Mumbai to decide fate of five hopeful sports 13.10.2023,"Forty years after New Delhi hosted the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) plenary assembly, the Congress is to be held in Mumbai in mid-October. While the Olympicmovement regards India as one of its emerging markets, the subcontinent has yet to host an Olympic Games. Apart from electing eight new IOC members, the addition of new sports to the Olympic program will be up for discussion on India's west coast.
Eight new IOC members (four men, four women) nominated by its Executive Board are to be elected at the congress, including German sporting events manager Michael Mronz. He stands to become the third German IOC member, along with its president, Thomas Bach, and Britta Heidemann.
Originally, the congress in Mumbai was to vote on the awarding of the 2030 Winter Olympics. However, the IOC has postponed that decision until 2024 while it awaits a report on extended specifications and requirements for hosting the Winter Games, taking into account climate change and sustainability.
Another key item will be the report of the commission that looked at the sports to be included at the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.
Having seen bids for squash to be included in the summer Olympics fail ahead of the 2012, 2016, 2020 and 2024 Games, Zena Wooldridge, president of the World Squash Federation thinks 2028 could be their year.
""There are all kinds of innovations that can be brought to the sport to make it almost a combination of eSports and physical sports,"" Wooldridge said. ""We've also been working to make the sport more attractive to spectators, such as putting the courts in unusual places like theaters.""
Apart from squash, four other sports are bidding for inclusion at the Olympics: baseball-softball, cricket, flag football and lacrosse.
Germany hasn't hosted the Olympics since the 1972 Summer Games were hosted by Munich. In the past 20 years alone, four initiatives to submit a German bid to host the games have failed.
Undeterred, the German Olympic Sports Confederation (DOSB) is now working on drafting a new bid, which is to be finalized by the end of 2023. However, it already has a slogan: "" Your ideas, your games."" The DOSB has selected Berlin, Leipzig, Munich, Hamburg, and the Rhine-Ruhr region as potential co-hosts.
Michael Mronz, who led the failed Rhine-Ruhr private-sector Olympic initiative for 2032, is convinced that 2036 would be the right year for Germany to host the Games again.
""The 2036 Olympic and Paralympic Games could be an opportunity to present a Germany that is open to the world, that is welcoming, that is sustainable,"" said the likely new IOC member.
However, there is significant opposition to the move. Green Party politician Christian Hierneis is a spokesman for the ""NOlympia"" network. In 2013, Hierneis spent weeks campaigning against a bid to host the 2022 Olympic Games in Munich, Garmisch, Ruhpolding and Berchtesgadener Land. His campaign was ultimately successful as the Olympic bid was overturned in a regional referendum. Ten years later, his opinion on hosting the Olympics – and the IOC has not changed.
""The IOC is purely a money-making operation,"" Hierneis told DW. ""The host city contract alone, which organizing cities have to sign. It's a gagging contract, nothing has changed. The municipalities have to relinquish all rights but also bear the liability for all damages. And of course, these municipalities are also supposed to pay the IOC representatives who travel to the event and earn millions. That's where the money goes. That's brutal.""

https://www.dw.com/en/hawaiis-ironman-goes-ironwoman/a-67075961,SPORTS,Hawaii's Ironman goes Ironwoman 13.10.2023,"You could argue that it would be more fitting to refer to the 2023 triathlon in the small municipality of Kailua-Kona on the island of Hawaii as the ""Ironwoman."" For the first time since the Ironman made its debut in 1978, only women will be competing in the race that features a 3.8-kilometer (2.4 miles) swim, a 180-kilometer bike ride and a marathon.
""The energy and the vibe around town is going to be different – I'm looking forward to it,"" said Britain's Laura Siddall ahead of what will be her fifth Ironman in the Pacific US state.
It's an ""opportunity to get more women here, there are so many first timers, so (it's) really bolstering the female side of the sport,"" Siddall added.
A post shared by Triathlon Magazine (@triathlonmagazine)
However, four-time winner of the Hawaii Ironman, Daniela Ryf, who is again among the favorites, doesn't seem quite as enthusiastic about the new format.
""I'm going to miss the guys a little bit. It will change the race dynamic. And the vibe before the start,"" said the Swiss athlete, who set a new world record at the Ironman in Roth, Germany, in June.
""Now we women have the stage completely to ourselves.""
However, this isn't the first time the men and the women have been separated – last year they competed on two different days. While this did have the desired effect of putting the women in greater focus than previously, it didn't solve the problem of what had become an unmanageable number of visitors to the island. The number of participants had grown to around 5,500, more than double that of the previous edition prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. That's not to mention the athletes' partners and supporters.
It proved to be simply too much for Kailua-Kona and its 23,000 inhabitants.
""The infrastructure isn't designed for that,"" said DW reporter Tobias Oelmaier, who was in Kailua-Kona as a triathlete himself at last year's Ironman. ""At times, the local grocery store ran out of pasta and bottled water,""
This was not to the liking of the athletes ― or the locals.
""They were angry because they had to close their businesses for longer than usual, angry because they couldn't get to work because athletes were everywhere and acting like they owned the place,"" said Canadian former triathlete Sara Gross of last year's event.
""We learned… that more than one race day during IRONMAN week is too many for the community to manage,"" concluded Hawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth.
Organizers came to the same conclusion, which led to the decision to separate the men's and women's races not only in time, as in 2022, but also in space. Now the plan is for the men and women to alternate between Hawaii and Nice on the French Riviera until at least 2026. This year's men's Ironman World Championship was held in Nice on September 10.
The change is not without its critics, among them, two-time Hawaii winner Patrick Lange. The German, who took silver at the premiere in Nice, insists that ""this race belongs in Hawaii.""
""I have adjusted to the challenge of Nice by necessity,"" he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper.
More than 2,100 triathletes from 73 nations will compete in Hawaii this Saturday ― 53 of them in the professional category. Among the contenders on the professional side is Germany's Anne Haug, who won the women's event in 2019, and finished third in 2018 and 2022.
""The island likes me. I always win a medal,"" the 40-year-old said in the run-up with a wink. 
Like Ryf, it seems German contender Laura Philip will miss the men a bit.
""It feels weird, I have to be honest,"" the 36-year-old Philipp said. ""But also in a good way. I'm sure it will be really cool.
""I heard from Nice that there was an excess of testosterone without the women. I can't say yet whether I feel like there's a surplus of estrogen here,"" added the 2021 and 2022 European champion.
Her preference, she said, would be for the event to be held in the future at a location in which women and men could compete together again – just on different days.
Incidentally, equal pay has never been an issue at the Ironman in Hawaii. Starting in 1986, when prize money was first awarded, the men and women have always received the same amount. This year, the winner in Hawaii will receive $125,000 (€118,000) – exactly the same amount as Frenchman Sam Laidlow, who finished first in Nice.

https://www.dw.com/en/olympics-ioc-suspends-russia-over-annexed-ukrainian-regions/a-67082194,SPORTS,Olympics: IOC suspends Russia over annexed Ukrainian regions 12.10.2023,"The Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) has been suspended by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after it ""unilaterally"" decided to recognize regional sports organizations in four annexed Ukrainian territories as members.
The four regional organizations, namely in Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia, represent partially occupied and illegally annexed Ukrainian regions which, according to the IOC, fall ""under the authority of the national Olympic Committee of Ukraine.""
The step, taken by the ROC on October 5, therefore ""constitutes a breach of the Olympic Charter because it violates the territorial integrity"" of the national Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Suspending the ROC with ""immediate effect,"" IOC spokesman Mark Adams said: ""The Russian Olympic Committee is no longer entitled to operate as a National Olympic Committee, as defined in the Olympic Charter, and cannot receive any funding from the Olympic movement."" 
The ban removes the right of the ROC to get funding from the Switzerland-based IOC, which is worth millions of dollars in each four-year Olympic funding cycle.
But the suspension does not immediately affect any Russians who are returning to compete in international sporting events as neutral athletes.
Ukrainian presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak welcomed the move as an ""important decision,"" saying: ""We communicated with our partners that sports cannot be beyond politics when a terrorist country commits genocide and uses athletes as propaganda.""
Moscow, on the other hand, denounced the decision as ""politically motivated,"" with an ROC statement reading: ""The IOC has taken yet another counterproductive, politically motivated decision. Russian athletes, the majority of [whom] are still groundlessly banned from international performances, are not affected in any way by this step.""
In contrast to Moscow's claims, however, the IOC under President Thomas Bach has actually been accused of being too sympathetic towards Russia not only regarding the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but also by failing to exclude all the country's athletes and teams from any Olympics despite proven allegations of state-backed doping.
The IOC initially banned Russia – and its ally Belarus – from international sports events after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. However, a few months ago, it recommended to sports federations to allow Russians and Belarusians to return as neutral athletes in individual events and under strict conditions.
However this recommendation doesn't concern their participation at the Summer Olympics in Paris next year or the Milano Cortina Winter Games in 2026.
IOC spokesman Adams nevertheless stressed that nothing in Thursday's announcement changed the IOC's position on Russian athletes wishing to compete under a neutral flag at next year's Paris Olympics.
The IOC said that a decision on the participation of individual neutral athletes with Russian passports at those events will be taken ""at the appropriate time.""
The Russian Olympic Committee could challenge the IOC decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, Switzerland.
""ROC, as a participant in the international sports movement, reserves the right to protect its own interests, as well as the interests of athletes and organizations of a sovereign country, which we represent in good faith,"" the body said.
Earlier this week, European football's governing body UEFA reversed a decision to allow Russian youth teams to re-enter international competitions.
Back in June, Russian and Belarussian tennis players returned to Wimbledon under neutral flags.

https://www.dw.com/en/bernie-ecclestone-given-suspended-sentence-after-admitting-tax-fraud/a-67075620,LAW AND JUSTICE,Bernie Ecclestone given suspended sentence after admitting tax fraud 12.10.2023,"Bernie Ecclestone, formerly the most powerful man in the world of Formula One racing, walked away from a London court on Thursday with a 17-month jail term, suspended for two years, after admitting fraud.
Southwark Crown Court heard that Ecclestone has agreed to a civil settlement of £652.6 million ($803m) with the British tax authorities over funds that were owed spanning an 18-year period.
The charge related to a trust in Singapore with a bank account that contained around $650 million, which he failed to declare in 2015.
The charge alleged that Ecclestone represented his accounts in a way ""which was, and which you knew was or might have been untrue or misleading.""
Ecclestone, who had pleaded not guilty to the charge at a hearing earlier this year, ""now accepts that some tax is due in relation to these matters,"" prosecutor Richard Wright said.
""I plead guilty,"" Ecclestone had told the court during a short hearing on Thursday morning in London. He claimed that he had set up a ""single trust"" with his three daughters the beneficiaries.
His defense lawyer, Christine Montgomery, told the presiding Judge that he ""bitterly regrets the events that led to this criminal trial.""
The Judge declared that while the offenses are serious, Ecclestone's age — he turns 93 later this month — and health would be taken into account during sentencing, with the business magnate spared jail time.
Ecclestone, a former second-hand car salesman who revolutionized Formula One in 1974 when he formed the Formula One Constructors Association, is the 65th wealthiest person in the United Kingdom with an estimated personal wealth of over $3 billion.
He paid $100 million to German authorities in 2014 to end a high-profile bribery trial linked to the sale of F1's rights in 2006 and 2007.
He also sparked controversy in 2009 when he said that Adolf Hitler ""was a man who could get things done"" and last year, when he defended Vladimir Putin over the invasion of Ukraine, claiming he would ""take a bullet"" for the Russian president.
Formula One distanced themselves from his comments, claiming they didn't represent their views, with Ecclestone later apologizing.
He controlled the sport for four decades until 2017 when he stepped down as chief executive from his global empire with American group Liberty Media taking over the series.

https://www.dw.com/en/india-v-pakistan-more-than-a-cricket-match/a-67070026,SPORTS,India v Pakistan: More than a cricket match 12.10.2023,"Saturday sees a meeting between the teams ranked first and second in the world in one day cricket. India and Pakistan have both won each of their two matches at the Cricket World Cup. Tickets are reportedly changing hands for about $300,000 on the black market for the group stage clash at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, India.
Whether in India or Pakistan, the millions who can't be in the 132,000-capacity ground, named after India's controversial but enduring Prime Minister, will doubtlessly be gripped by the sport. But this also represents something bigger.

""Being the hardcore cricket fan I am, I watch every cricket match of India. But there are a lot of Indians who will watch the match only because India is playing Pakistan, an eternal enemy country which hates the existence of the Indian people, state, and the country,"" Vinay Kumar, an Indian fan from New Delhi, told DW.
In his answer, Kumar referenced the 2008 Mumbai attacks when members of a militant Islamic organization from Pakistan killed 175 people in a flurry of shooting and bombing attacks. India have not toured Pakistan since two years before that incident (they are not alone in this stance) and the sides no longer play bilateral series against each other. It is one of a number of incidents, beginning with the Partitioning of British India in 1947, and taking in two major wars, the Kashmir conflict, several diplomatic fracas and countless harsh words, that have led to such hostile relations between the countries.
The choice of stadium, or rather its name, has inflamed tensions still futher, according to some Pakistani fans.
""While the Indians would like the world to believe otherwise, it's a psychological ploy to intimidate the Pakistani team, as the stadium is named after the anti-Pakistani Prime minister of India and the home state of Gujarat is Narendra Modi's home state. So the anti-Pakistani sentiment would be there,"" Khurram Shehzad, a Pakistan fan from Lahore told DW.
Modi is perceived by a number of observers to be anti-Muslim. An alleged decision to pull back the police during an anti-Muslim riot in Gujarat (where he was Chief Minister) in 2002, which contributed to the killing of hundreds of people plays a part in that, as does the suggestion from many that India's Muslim minority population are treated as second class citizens in the country.
""The cricket teams by themselves have a bonhomie between them,"" Shehzad added. ""As far as the general public is concerned, it's like a war for them, they would rather lose the World Cup than lose to each other.""
Such sentiment is common in a number of fans DW spoke to, though some are much more conciliatory. ""Given the unfortunate history both neighbors share, it is only natural for most to be driven by patriotism when it comes to supporting their team. However, one should consider it nothing more than a professional sporting event. The stadium is no place to practice politics or unfounded nationalism,"" Miran Rehmat Khan, a Pakistan fan from Islamabad, said.
On the other side of the divide, Purnima Tiwari pointed to similarities between the two nations. ""Everything in India and Pakistan from Bollywood to music, history, and practices shows a strong link to a common cultural heritage anyways. If our entertainment isn't different then we can easily enjoy a friendly match together.""
But Khan also concedes that such concepts of unity and openness are tested by India's decision to so far not allow Pakistani fans and journalists to travel to the tournament. This came after delaying the entry of Pakistan's players, a pair of decisions she said are ""all about politics"".
""[It] creates a damning shadow over its much-celebrated 'secular and open' social and political fabric,"" he added. ""I am sure this would have been a great opportunity for people-to-people contact. It might have even been a step in the right direction towards normalizing diplomatic relations.""
Muhammad Akram, a journalist and cricket fan from Lahore, agrees with his compatriot. ""It is always a heart warming scene to see Pakistani supporters cheering their team in a foreign territory and it would have been of immense interest to see them in a stadium in India to support their team. It is not good that Pakistani fans were not allowed to cross over and more so for denying visas to journalists. This is against the spirit of the game and sportsmanship.""
The VISA issue has caused plenty of off-field controversy, which the players, many of whom are teammates in club and franchise cricket, generally go out of their way to avoid. But plenty of Indian fans are less coy.
""I don't think there is any problem in this [failing to issue VISAs]. You reap what you sow. They should be thankful that we have welcomed their cricket team. They should not expect anything more than that,"" Himanshu Shukla, from Jaipur, told DW, while his compatriot Kumar was stronger still: ""In an ideal world, the Pakistani cricket team would not be allowed to travel to India,"" he said, drawing parallels with how Russian athletes have been excluded from sporting events since the start of the Ukraine war.
The issues dividing these two countries, and many of their citizens and politicians are tangled, complex and fraught, with occasional meetings in major international cricket tournaments one of the few remaining times where the rivalry is given a defined shape.
""In India, it is customary to hear noises of [fire] crackers after India has won any big match. No matter which city or which neighborhood you are in,"" explained Tiwari. ""So, even if you have been living under a rock, you will know that the Indian team is performing well."" A Pakistan win would likely be celebrated in similar fashion back in Pakistan. But, as it stands, there will not be a single visiting fan able to cheer from the stands.
Whatever the result, the future of both teams in the tournament will not be resolved at this stage. Neither, it seems, will relations between these two countries.

https://www.dw.com/en/bosnian-swimmer-lana-pudar-chasing-olympic-history/a-67063310,SPORTS,Bosnian swimmer Lana Pudar chasing Olympic history 11.10.2023,"Imagine being 17 years old and one of your sport's most promising talents. Then imagine representing a country that has never won an Olympic medal.
That is the reality for Bosnia's Lana Pudar, who is targeting a podium place at next year's Paris Games.
""Of course I want a medal,"" Pudar told DW in an interview, her face lighting up at the prospect. ""That's like the world for my country, for everyone. I will be forever in the history books. That's what I really hope for.""
""I think I am somewhere near because [at the World Championships] in Fukuoka this year I was fourth. I need more races, I need to learn how to compete with the highest level of athletes. I need to improve everything. I need to improve my training, I need to drop my time. But I think I have that potential.""
There is no doubting Pudar's potential in her favorite event, the 200-meter butterfly, although the gap between her and one of her main rivals was clear at the recent World Cup leg in Berlin.
Despite digging in on the last length to claim the bronze medal, she finished almost two seconds behind China's Zhang Yufei, the runaway winner and reigning Olympic champion. Still, the race gave her valuable experience of competing alongside a top-class international field.
""It's really important because this is the start of a new season,"" Pudar said. ""It's important to see where I am now and what else I have to do to improve, to be at the best level at the Olympic Games.""
Bosnia is one of just four European participants to have never won an Olympic medal (the others are Albania, Andorra and Monaco), but Pudar is well-placed to change that. A gold medal at last year's European championships in Rome signaled her arrival on the senior stage, turning her into an overnight star back home.
However, not everyone celebrated the teenager's victory. In neighboring Serbia, nationalist newspapers berated her for choosing to compete for Bosnia, given that they consider her father to be a Serb. One particularly condescending headline read: ""The new champion of Europe, she didn't want Serbia, she chose Bosnia!""
While some try to make political capital from Pudar's success and claim her as their own, the swimmer herself is keen to shut out the noise.
""I see that people love me in my country especially, but I see that the neighbors respect me too,"" she said. ""I really wanted to swim for Bosnia because that's my country. I was born there, I was raised there and I really want to make big things for my hometown and my country.""
Perhaps it hasn't helped Pudar's cause that her father, Velibor, was a well-known athlete himself, playing football for and coaching a number of clubs at home and abroad, including in Serbia.
Overall, though, she feels she benefits from her family's sporting background.
""It's good to have someone who understands the sport and the sacrifices,"" Pudar said. ""They never put pressure on me, neither him nor my mother. Everyone is just happy. They believe in my coaches, that's the most important thing.""
The sacrifices to which Pudar refers are huge. While her friends get to go shopping or to the cinema, she subjects herself to a grueling daily routine.
That includes a 5 a.m. wake-up call for her first training session of the day, on dry land, which is followed by a couple of two-to two-and-a-half hour stints in the pool and some time in the gym.
Complicating matters is the fact that her hometown, Mostar, doesn't have an Olympic-size pool, meaning she has to travel further afield to train, typically to the capital Sarajevo or to Banja Luka, Bosnia's second city.

""My life is very difficult and different from other teenagers,"" Pudar admitted. ""I need to go to swimming camps all over Europe and the world, so I'm not at home very often. It's a really busy schedule. In the meantime, when I'm at home, I need to go to school. It's really tiring.
""I'm a very simple lady,"" she added, laughing. ""I don't have any hobbies, other than swimming. But that's not my hobby, it's my full-time job.""
So is it all work and no play? ""I find some time but not very often,"" the 17-year-old said. And here is where the old adage, 'no pain, no gain,' comes in, especially considering the 200-meter butterfly is regarded by many as swimming's toughest event.
""It really hurt,"" Pudar said after the final in Berlin. But she has no doubt she has what it takes to close the gap on her rivals.
""I believe in myself, I believe in my coaches and in my training,"" she said. ""This is a really good start to the season.""

https://www.dw.com/en/euro-2028-in-uk-and-ireland-euro-2032-in-italy-turkey/a-67059229,SPORTS,"Euro 2028 in UK and Ireland, Euro 2032 in Italy, Turkey 10.10.2023","European football's governing body UEFA announced the host countries of two upcoming European Championships on Tuesday, awarding the 2028 tournament to the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland and the 2032 tournament to Italy and Turkey.
Both bids ultimately ran unopposed but still needed official UEFA approval, which was conferred at a meeting in Nyon, Switzerland.
Turkey last week withdrew from the bidding process for Euro 2028 and joined Italy's bid for the 2032 edition, clearing the path for Britain and Ireland, who shelved plans to bid to host the 2030 World Cup to focus on staging the European Championship.
""The UK and Ireland thanks UEFA for its confidence... and congratulates Italy and Turkey on their appointment for Euro 2032,"" read a joint statement from the five football associations which make up the 2028 bid — England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom, plus the Republic of Ireland.
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak welcomed the decision, saying: ""I grew up with Euro 1996 [in England] being one of the most amazing memories of my childhood. And we have a chance to do that all over again for lots more people. We're going to welcome millions of people to the country, and it's going to inspire a whole new generation.""
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on X, formerly Twitter, that he was ""over the moon that Ireland and the UK will co-host Euro 2028,"" adding: ""It will be the biggest event ever hosted by our two islands working together.""
England, which hosted the women's European Championship last year as well as the semifinals and final of the pan-continental Euro 2020, last organized a full men's tournament in 1996, when the European Championship involved just 16 teams and was won by Germany.
Six of the proposed venues for the 2028 tournament are in England, including Wembley Stadium, the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London, the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, St. James' Park in Newcastle, Villa Park in Birmingham and Everton's new stadium in Liverpool, which is still under construction.
Belfast, Dublin, Glasgow and Cardiff are also in line for matches, with the Welsh capital also bidding to host the opening game. ""Cardiff would be perfect for the opening match,"" said Noel Mooney, chief executive of the Football Association of Wales.
""It's a really good partnership. We know we're going to have five games in Northern Ireland, six in Wales, Scotland and Ireland,"" said English FA chief executive Mark Bullingham.
""It's brilliant those countries are going to get a significant portion of games, particularly if they end up with some of their own home games – it will really excite the countries.""
Like England, Italy also hosted games at the pan-continental Euro 2020, with three group stage matches and one quarter-final taking place in Rome. But the country has not hosted a full major tournament on its own since the 1990 World Cup, won by West Germany.
Turkey, which hosted last season's men's Champions League final in Istanbul, has never been awarded a major international competition, bidding unsuccessfully to stage every European Championship going back to 2008.
""We are happy to host EURO 2032 with the friendly country of Italy,"" said Turkish sports minister Osman Askin Bak on social media. ""It is an honor to be rewarded for the steps we have taken on the 100th anniversary of our beautiful country, which we have woven together with investments into sport. The heart of football will beat in Turkey in 2032!""
The Turkish Football Federation promised to offer spectators ""the ultimate European Championship experience"" but the country is likely to face accusations of sportswashing, the practice of using sport to launder the image of a nation and distract from issues such as human rights abuses or democratic deficits.
Since his reelection in May, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has not shown any clemency towards, or announced an amnesty for, thousands of political opponents who have been imprisoned.
Erdogan's critics have been fighting a years-long crackdown on freedoms and media independence.
The offence of ""insulting the president"" was frequently used during Erdogan's last term to muffle dissident voices.
According to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), 38 journalists are behind bars and dozens have fled abroad.
In recent years, Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) has invested heavily in Istanbul side FK Basaksehir, who play in the blue and orange colors of the AKP.
While both tournaments will be co-hosted by two nations, the 2028 bid is unique in that it actually features five separate football associations, an historical legacy of the sport having first been codified in the United Kingdom and thus having established football associations for each nation.
Consequently, UEFA have taken the unusual step of not conferring automatic qualification for England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, insisting instead that they go through qualifying – albeit with two spots reportedly reserved for the two best-performing host nations who fail to qualify.
""It's always been part of our discussions with the other countries and UEFA that we would take part in qualifying. We think with the new format of European football that's the right thing to do,"" said English FA chief Bullingham.
""It is better to play in a tournament where it matters and to have competitive games. It's great to be taking part in qualifying and we want to get everyone there.""
The next European Championship will be played in Germany next year, from June 14 to July 14.

https://www.dw.com/en/adam-peaty-back-in-the-pool-after-mental-health-break/a-67035000,SPORTS,Adam Peaty back in the pool after mental health break 09.10.2023,"After a few minutes in the company of  Adam Peaty, you quickly realize he is fond of a metaphor. He speaks of roller coasters and mountains, and of scoreboards telling their own story.
It is surely a sign of the journey that the three-time Olympic champion has been on over the last year or so, following his well-documented mental health break and his dealing with what he describes as ""the devil on my shoulder.""
This past weekend's swimming World Cup event in Berlin marked Peaty's first competition since March, during which time he took a complete break from the sport. 
""I'm very grateful for the opportunity, it's great to be against some of the world's best,"" he said after competing in the 100-meter breaststroke, the event in which he has won back-to-back Olympic gold medals.
""It's a lot of fun for me at the moment, and if we have the fun, we can build on whatever we need to build on.""
To hear Peaty talk in such terms — he is, after all, the fastest breaststroke swimmer in history — shows where he is in his life right now and the daily battle he still faces.
""I wish it was a constant up,"" the 28-year-old said. ""It's still a rollercoaster, this sport is extremely demanding. You're going to have those lows, no matter how happy you are. The scoreboard is always going to say what it says. But as long as you find happiness in that and enjoy it, no one can take that away from you.""
Rewind to last year and Peaty was in a very different place. He was burnt out and had turned to alcohol after a broken foot, a disappointing Commonwealth Games and the end of his relationship with the mother of his son. ""I've been on a self-destructive cycle,"" Peaty confessed to the British newspaper The Times in April.
The relentlessness of the life of an elite swimmer — hours plowing up and down a pool, racking up the kilometers, alone with your thoughts — coupled with the sacrifices required to maintain a world-beating level, had finally caught up with him.
""You are on your own all the time,"" Peaty told DW in Berlin. ""It's an individual sport. It's me, every single day. And in that is loneliness because you've got to be selfish. You've got to push away opportunities that you'd otherwise enjoy so it doesn't compromise the training.""
""It's a challenge to myself now, to be honest. Because you can stop this sport or life in a place which is down and low. I'm not doing this for any other person than me, for the first time ever. I don't have to be here. I want to be here, enjoy it and be the best.""
If taking part is currently more important than the winning, Peaty can count himself satisfied with finishing in sixth place in the 100-meter final. But his time of 59.85 seconds — nearly three seconds slower than his world record — suggests there is a lot of work to be done to recapture his best form before the Olympics in Paris next year.
""I'm missing a lot,"" he told DW after the race. ""It's going to be a steep mountain to get to where I want to go to. I've been out of the game for a while. I just need to get back to racing again. And it's  going to need a lot of it.""
Waiting for Peaty at the top of that mountain will be China's Qin Haiyang, the world record holder over 200 meters and the biggest threat to the Brit's Olympic crown in years.
Qin took an unprecedented clean sweep of the three breaststroke events at July's world championships in Fukuoka, a feat he repeated at September's Asian Games and here in Berlin. He has made no secret of his desire to break Peaty's 50- and 100-meter world records.
The 24-year-old clocked 57.69 seconds in the 100 meters in Berlin — identical to his time in Fukuoka — which is 0.81 seconds off Peaty's best and puts him second on the all-time list. He told reporters here that he ""respects"" his rival. But there is not much room for sentimentality at this level.
""I think I can do better,"" Qin said ominously. ""This year I've had so many competitions, so my body feels a little tired.""
Peaty, on the other hand, says he is trying to stay realistic.
""We're in two very different places as athletes,"" he said. ""He's coming off a superb summer, I'm coming into a nice winter with no racing. So it's very different. It's very hard to stand up there at the start of the season and race those kinds of people because it's basically an Olympic final.""
The Olympics, though, are for another day. And although Peaty may not yet be back to his best in the pool, he remains the biggest draw out of it. Having completed his interview duties, he was pulled aside for a selfie by two young German swimmers, duly obliging with a laugh and a smile.
For Peaty, right now, that is what it is all about.

https://www.dw.com/en/asian-games-china-tops-table-as-india-gifted-cricket-gold/a-67029410,SPORTS,Asian Games: China tops table as India gifted cricket gold 07.10.2023,"After two weeks of competition involving 12,500 participants from 45 nations and territories in 481 events across 40 sports and 61 disciplines, the postponed 2022 Asian Games came to a close in Hangzhou, China, on Sunday.
Predictably, hosts China top the medal table with a total of 382 medals, 200 of them gold, followed at some distance by Japan (51 golds) and South Korea (42), with just two more finals to come on Sunday in artistic swimming and men's karate.
As well as seeing debuts for new events such as e-sports and breakdancing, the Games have also seen a number of sporting and political controversies.
From a washed-out cricket final to failed doping tests and banned North Korean flags on display, DW summarizes the main talking points.
Ahead of its Olympic debut in Paris next year, breakdancing arrived at the Asian Games in a whirlwind of baggy pants and beats, as ""b-boys"" and ""b-girls"" competed in a continental showpiece for the first time.
As a DJ spun tracks and an MC hyped the contestants up, dancers in t-shirts, tracksuits and baseball caps flipped, jigged and spun on their heads to a throbbing beat, cheered on by notably young crowds waving glowsticks.
""It feels really great,"" said Kim Hong-yul of South Korea, who lost to Shigeyuki Nakarai of Japan in the men's Gold Medal Battle on Saturday. ""I've been literally staying with my culture and this culture keeps growing up, and I've been keeping watching it, so I'm happy for it.""
The women's gold was won by Qingyi Liu of China who beated Japan's Ami Yuasa in the final, and organizers are hoping that breaking, along with e-sports, can help attract young viewers turned off by traditional Games sports.
When asked whether recognition by big multi-sports events would compromise breakdancing's original counterculture spirit, Kim was confident that the sport could get the balance right.
""Just because it becomes a sport, we're not going get rid of our previous culture, we're going to keep this culture... it's going to be great,"" he said.
India's men were awarded cricket gold by virtue of their higher world ranking after the T20 final against Afghanistan was rained off.
After rain stopped play, the match was ultimately abandoned soon after 17:00 local time with Afghanistan at 112-5 after 18.2 overs of the first innings, leaving India unable to bat a minimum required five overs or even start their innings at all.
Unlike in other tournaments, Games regulations don't allow for usual tie-breaking criteria such as runs-per-over or previous performance credentials, with the match being automatically awarded to the higher-ranked team instead, meaning tenth-placed Afghanistan drew the short straw against world number on India.
""Pretty much disappointing, I would say,"" said Indian captain Ruturaj Gaikwad when asked about the weather. ""Obviously we would love to have had a full game .... But that's one thing we cannot control.""
Nevertheless, he said that winning a medal ""still feels very good, makes us feel very proud. ""Being an Indian captain is always a lot of pressure because everyone expects the ultimate prize. Wherever you go, everyone just keeps on saying: 'Win gold, win gold!'""
It's been an historic Games for India, winning over a century of medals for the first time with 107 in total, including 28 gold, two of which were won on the final Saturday in archery and women's kabaddi - a tag-meets-rugby contact team sport rooted in Indian mythology and said to date back 5,000 years.
But what should have been a day of celebration came with a large dollop of controversy when the men's kabaddi final against Iran descended into chaos and was suspended, before India finally sealed the title.
A captivating match was locked at 28-28 with just over a minute left when India went on a ""raid"" for points, with both teams claiming they should get the decision.
That sparked a prolonged video review, then a standoff and the suspension of the final, as numerous officials checked the footage and attempted to make a ruling.
The action in what was an eagerly anticipated showdown was put on hold as both teams at different points appeared to refuse to play and argued their case. Order was eventually restored with the score at 31-29 in India's favour.
Iran reluctantly carried on but they were deflated and quickly slumped to a 33-29 defeat, coach Gholamreza Mazandarani pointing the finger at the officials and also accusing the Indian team of putting pressure on the referees.
""This is very bad, very bad for kabaddi,"" he said of the fractious scenes.
Japan retained their Asian Games women's football crown by beating North Korea 4-1 in the gold medal match – despite being booed throughout by the majority of a partisan 35,000 crowd.
And it wasn't just the local fans who were overwhelmingly in favor of the North Koreans, with Games organizers, the Olympic Council of Asia, also attracting criticism from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for allowing the North Korean flag to be displayed throughout the fortnight.
WADA declared North Korea's national anti-doping body ""non-compliant"" in 2021 and imposed sanctions that remain in place today. They include not being able to fly its flag at any regional, continental or world sports event, excluding the Olympics and Paralympics.
Nevertheless, the North Korean team carried its flag at the opening ceremony in Hangzhou and it has been routinely hoisted at medal ceremonies. In a statement to AFP, WADA said the OCA had breached its obligations as a signatory to its anti-doping code.
""WADA takes this matter extremely seriously and has written to the OCA on several occasions before and after the opening ceremony of the Games, explaining in clear terms the possible consequences that could arise for the OCA if this matter is ignored,"" it said.
""WADA is disappointed that the OCA has to date not taken steps to comply with the terms of the DPRK's non-compliance,"" it added, using an acronym for North Korea. ""WADA will follow due process to ensure that the appropriate consequences are imposed for the OCA's refusal to meet its signatory obligations.""
Despite its years-long isolation from the global sporting arena, North Korea has produced some eye-opening results on its return, notably in weightlifting, where its competitors have smashed six world records.
Jang Song Nam, manager of the North Korean weightlifting team, said the success was ""payback"" for their sacrifices over years of Covid isolation.
""Our athletes for these Asian Games have put in so much hard work,"" he said. ""Every gold medal is payback for our hardship over four years. We are world leaders now. We wanted to show our strength, and we did it.""
But several rival lifters, including women's world champion Jiang Huihua and men's world champion Li Fabin, both of China, expressed ""shock"" and ""surprise"" at the results.
No North Korean weightlifters will participate in next year's Paris Olympics because they failed to take part in mandatory qualifying events earlier this year.
Elsewhere, Wesam Nasser Al-Farsi became the second Saudi Arabian runners to be banned after testing positive for darbepoetin, a blood-booster similar to erythropoietin (EPO). The middle distance runner, who finished in the 3,000m steeplechase last Sunday, became the sixth athlete overall to be banned at the Games.
Turkmenistan's Tejen Tejenov, who took silver in the men's +90kg kurash event, became the first Hangzhou medallist to be banned for doping on Thursday.
Finally, Bahrain's Kemi Adekoya – who was stripped of the 2018 title for doping – won 400m hurdles gold. A former world indoor champion, she claimed at the time her food was spiked.
""I just wanted to fight and get the gold medal, and fight for a new record,"" she said this week in Hangzhou after clocking a Games-record 54.45 seconds.

Leadership of the women's team had been uncertain since the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, with coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg on sick leave for several weeks now.
Details of her condition have not been made public. Senior players including captain Alexandra Popp had started to complain about the period of uncertainty, with Voss-Tecklenburg's illness announced by the DFB on September 8.
The side was not even able to complete its debrief following its shock exit in the group phase of the competition in Australia and New Zealand.
The DFB also said Hrubesch was bringing his colleague Thoman Nörenberg with him as an assistant. Britta Carlson, who had been deputizing for Voss-Tecklenburg until now, will continue to work alongside Hrubesch and Nörenberg.
""With a view to the hopefully continuing recovery of Martina Voss-Tecklenburg as well as in cosideration of sporting developments, Hrubesch and Nörenberg are taking over until further notice,"" the DFB said. 
SV Hamburg said Hrubesch would continue his duties as director of the youth academy performance center when not in duty for the women's national team. 
""For me it's a matter of the heart,"" said Hrubesch, who was interim coach to many of the current players as recently as 2018, before Voss-Tecklenburg took up the job. ""I did not have to think about the request for very long."" 
""I'm looking forward to the collective work with the team. We will together try to put ourselves in a good position for the Olympic qualifying process in the remaining Nations League games,"" Hrubesch said. 
The team is in action later this month, against Wales at home on October 27 and then in Iceland on October 31.
As well as his 8 months with the women's team in 2018, Hrubsech has spent much of his coaching career working with the German federation in various roles, often connected to youth talent. 
At Euro 2000, he was assistant coach to the senior men's team under Erich Ribbeck. In the years that followed, he's coached Germany's under-18's, under-19's, under-20's and under-21's for various stints, and also stewarded Germany's 2016 Olympic team in Rio de Janeiro. 
A striker in his playing days, best known for his proliffic stints with Rot-Weiss Essen and SV Hamburg, the 72-year-old won the Bundesliga title three times and is the league's third most efficient striker in terms of goals to number of games played, trailing only Robert Lewandowski and his contemporary Gerd Müller.

https://www.dw.com/en/simone-biles-golden-return-is-greatness-beyond-gymnastics/a-66995876,SPORTS,Simone Biles' golden return is greatness beyond gymnastics 06.10.2023,"Simone Biles is already considered the greatest gymnast ever. Now, with her third Olympic Games on the horizon, she is cementing her status as one of the greatest athletes ever.
At the World Artistic Gymnastic Championships in Antwerp, Belgium, the 26-year-old helped the US win gold in the team final and two days after that, won gold in the individual all-round. Finally, on Sunday, she claimed gold on balance beam, a dazzling routine earning her 14.800 points and a 22nd world gymnastics title overall.
She secured qualification for the final rounds by becoming the first-ever woman to land the ""Yurchenko double pike vault"" at an international competition, although she ultimately had to settle for silver on the vault behind Brazil's Rebeca Andrade after slipping on her trademark ""Yurchenko.""
Nevertheless, Biles is already the most decorated gymnast of all time with an astounding 36 medals across world championships and the Olympics.
These achievements alone would be remarkable enough, but in the context of Biles' past few years they are all the more incredible.
At the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, Biles withdrew from the individual all-around due to a case of the twisties, adding she needed to protect her mental health.
The twisties are a very unsettling sensation of effectively losing your air sense, but is quite common for athletes in acrobatic sports.
""It's extremely terrifying to lose it. It's like driving in the dark in a snow storm and losing sense of where the road is,"" sports psychologist Carlin Anderson told DW. ""It's particularly the case with Simone [Biles] who is doing such dangerous skills and acrobatics. She really could die — that's how serious it is.""
Anderson is the director of sport psychology at the University of Minnesota and founder of Premier Sport Psychology, a leading sport and performance psychology consulting group. Anderson, a former gymnast, has worked with US Olympic teams and specializes in handling mental blocks and performance anxiety in acrobatic sports.
""I work with lots of acrobatic athletes and the number one concern presented to me is mental blocking, losing their air sense. It varies how it impacts people, but there's always that component of reworking the skill,"" Anderson explains.
""In acrobatic sports, you're feeling your way through a skill. It happens too quickly to think about it. It takes split seconds, like when you slam on the brakes in the car, you're doing it automatically. Your body feels the right timing, when to twist and when to open.""
Without that, the situation becomes scary and the road back a long one.
""You need to rework the skill, often into soft mats, backtrack a bit and work on a component of the skill without twisting, slowly working your way back to safety,"" Anderson explains.
""It can take returning to a rudimentary way of how they first learned the skill, and going back to the progression ladder of training to get back to feeling where they are in the air. Most athletes will have it happen, just not in a moment like that.""
Biles is no stranger to facing situations that most do not.
The 26-year-old is a survivor of abuse, a former patient of Larry Nassar, the disgraced US team doctor now serving life imprisonment for sexual assault of underage gymnasts. Biles is also an American Black woman from a country embroiled in a racial reckoning, with women still fighting for equality.  
In short, it was no surprise to hear her admit this summer in response to her fans on Instagram that she has needed a lot of help to get herself back on her feet, let alone ready to compete again.
""Lots of therapy, I go once a week for almost two hours,"" Biles shared. ""I've had so much trauma, so being able to work on some of the traumas and work on healing is a blessing."" 
""It's incredible,"" Anderson said of Biles' comeback. ""A lot of other elite athletes have come forward with their mental health issues, but when they are so intense that you have to step away from the middle of an Olympic Games, it's a big ask to return at the same level.""
""We're witnessing something extremely rare, something that may not ever come around again,"" Anderson said of Biles' return to form.
Anderson believes Biles looks better than ever as a gymnast, but that her return to the floor let alone the top of the podium is game-changing.
""She has played a contributing role to the entire landscape of mental health in sport being appreciated as a normal part of life and that athletes are people too who have lives and trauma and anxiety,"" Anderson says. ""But they can also be the GOAT too,"" she adds, referring to the acronym ""greatest of all time,"" one often associated with Biles.
And so Biles' return to the floor let alone to form is really rather remarkable.
Most people would struggle to return to everyday life after just one of the traumas Biles has endured, but for the 26-year-old to be back to her professional best despite all that she has faced is just as amazing as her gymnastic ability.
After a two-year hiatus from the sport, Biles has already won in the US, and now at the Worlds in Belgium. She has quickly returned to the top of her game and the Olympics in Paris next year loom as the final chapter to an incredible comeback story.
Biles is a champion of her sport,  a pioneer for good mental health and a role model for Black women everywhere. Her return to the mat ranks as one of the greatest comebacks ever for a person and a gymnast.

https://www.dw.com/en/saudi-investment-in-the-premier-leagues-newcastle-paying-off/a-66997753,SPORTS,Saudi investment in the Premier League's Newcastle paying off 05.10.2023,"As the feverish anticipation that had simmered across Newcastle all day reached its boiling point, the stands of St. James’ Park were a rolling sea of black and white flags. Newcastle United were back in the Champions League after a 20-year absence and one of England’s most evocative and enduring grounds, packed with 52,000 fans, was ready for the visit of Paris Saint-Germain.
Less than a month earlier, the flags flying were green and white, as Saudi Arabia lost 1-0 to South Korea in an international friendly played here in front of just 3,000 people. For a club quick to point out that technically it is not directly owned by the Gulf country but by its Public Investment Fund (PIF), controlled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, it was a fairly brazen show of strength, a provocation to English football authorities who bought the obfuscation that this was not a state-owned club.
The confirmation, hours before kickoff, that the Saudis would bid for the 2034 World Cup, was a further flex of already well-developed muscles.
Newcastle's away strip now resembles that of the Saudi national team, and they are on their way to becoming the most popular club in the Gulf state. They have sold winger Allan Saint-Maximin to PIF club Al Ahli in Saudi Arabia and have signed a lucrative sponsorship deal with Sela, an events company majority owned by the PIF.
Newcastle’s opponents on Wednesday, PSG, have a similar ownership arrangement with Qatar while Champions League holders Manchester City are owned by the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Though such takeovers have met with some objection, success on the pitch seems to have eased concerns for the vast majority of fans in England and the loosely regulated Premier League. But not all of them.
John Hird, of the NUFC fans against Saudi Sportswashing (NUFCFAS) campaign, has said any success at a club where his family had been regulars for generations would leave a ""bad taste"" as a result of the ownership.
""Each fan has to live with their own conscience,"" he told DW. ""We would never say to fans that they should boycott. Basically our position is that we want fan groups, local politicians, councillors, MPs, the press, [Newcastle legend] Alan Shearer and everyone connected with the club, to stick to what they said, pre-takeover. All of them said that being taken over by the Saudi state would not stop us talking about human rights. Well, let's be honest, unfortunately, that hasn't happened.""
The club's manager, Eddie Howe, has repeatedly failed to address questions on a long list of human rights violations and the ongoing war in Yemen, citing a lack of knowledge of the situation and claiming it is not within his remit. According to Amnesty International, these violations include targeting ""individuals for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and association""  the ""death penalty following grossly unfair trials, including in cases of individuals who were children at the time of the alleged crime"" and ""codifying male guardianship and discrimination against women.""
Clips on social media have seen Newcastle fans lash out verbally at people who share Hird's perspective, a development he finds troubling.
""The problem is some Newcastle fans, unfortunately, repeat the propaganda. Now, that's totally unacceptable, we can't allow a bloody dictatorship to get that propaganda repeated. The majority of fans obviously do not support that. But that's the worrying thing.""
The NUFCFAS campaign is run by a small number of volunteers and had no significant presence at Wednesday's match. It appears abundantly clear that the majority of Newcastle fans either feel like their voice on ownership doesn't matter, are apathetic about the issue, or are simply pleased that that the Saudi takeover in 2021 lifted the club and city out of the doldrums and back on to the biggest stage.
""It's fantastic, like a dream,"" Mick Edmondson, who owns a sports memorabilia shop, The Back Page, told DW.
""I'm not speaking for every Newcastle fan. But the majority, and I mean a massive majority, of the people I've spoken to and the people I know and go to the matches with have the same view as me. It's absolutely tremendous.""
While fans like Edmondson just want to see the good times roll again in the northeast of England, and perhaps even win a first trophy since 1955, for others Saudi Arabia's investment in Newcastle, as well as in golf, cricket, Formula 1, the Saudi Pro League and other sports are part of something much bigger, and much more concerning.
""Saudi Arabia want to place themselves in the league of global powers like China and the USA, they want to become a big geopolitical player,"" Stanis Elsborg from Danish transparency and democracy in sport advocates Play the Game told DW.
""All of them (Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE) use sport as a means to address the aspirations and entertainment desires of the population, offering alternative sources of diversion and national pride in the absence of political rights and civil liberties.""
Elsborg expects the men's football World Cup to be the next jewel in the Saudi sporting crown, with the summer Olympics not far behind. But for Geordies like Edmondson, their impact on Newcastle is of greater concern.
""It's what they've done to the city as well, which doesn't get reported,"" Edmondson said. ""They've invested a lot of money in the city. For instance, we've got a very successful food bank on a matchday. And, as far as I'm led to believe, one of the directors [the foundation run by minority shareholders the Reuben brothers] actually finds out how much the food banks take and he doubles it for the homeless people of Newcastle and the northeast. The whole thing, in the city and the plans they've got for investment not just in the football club, but the city itself, and the region. It's just brilliant for everybody.""
The landscape is changing fast. The last time Newcastle played in the Champions League, in 2003, they were knocked out by Partizan Belgrade in the qualifying round. Back then, the club had a local owner, John Hall, and manager, Bobby Robson.
Though it's only 20 years ago, such a setup now appears quaint in a league where only a handful of clubs are even majority-owned by English people and the best managers are acquired from abroad.
That the doors of the Premier League, and the UK government, are at least ajar to anyone with enough money, including states with questionable human rights records, is nothing new. But the absence of any significant pushback in the stands or the streets suggests the overwhelming majority of fans are equally happy with the situation.
""The desire for better results and greater investment in the club may have outweighed potential concerns, which is just a shame, as the ownership comes with severe problems for the world of football."" said Elsborg. 
Rightly or wrongly, it’s fair to say that 52,000 Geordies didn’t think there was much amiss in the world of football as they poured out on to the sodden streets after a 4-1 win. Their second and third goals came from local lads Dan Burn and Sean Longstaff. This was a win for the Geordies. But it was also a win for the Saudis. It won’t be the last.

https://www.dw.com/en/jerome-boateng-at-bayern-munich-an-act-of-desperation/a-66988152,SOCCER,Jerome Boateng at Bayern Munich: An act of desperation 03.10.2023,"Jerome Boateng was in tears when he was brought off an hour in to Bayern's 5-2 win against Augsburg on the final day of the 2021 Bundesliga season. His then head coach Hansi Flick hugged him on the sidelines. After 10 years, 363 games, two Champions League titles, nine German championships, five German Cups and two Club World Cups, Boateng's career with Bayern Munich was over — or so it seemed.
But nearly two and a half years later, Boateng is back training with Bayern. What at first appears a romantic return turns out to be a panicked attempt by the defending Bundesliga champions to correct poor squad planning that sees them short of cover in central defense. That the 35-year-old is soon to be retried for assault increases the explosive nature of a possible return.
With his precision passing and speed, Boatengwould have been the perfect type of player for Thomas Tuchel at his peak. Both skills have absent from the Bavarian's defense so far this season, but whoever believes Boateng alone is going to solve the defensive issues at Bayern is likely to be disappointed.
Even in Boateng's final season for the club, Bayern conceded 44 goals — their worst record this century. And in the two years that followed, Boateng was far from convincing on the field.
After his move to Lyon, he was at first a regular member of the starting eleven but in the second half of the year, his minutes were limited as Lyon's then coach Peter Bosz preferred other players. French sports magazine ""L'Equipe"" also reported several verbal and even physical altercations between Boateng and his teammates.
Even after the departure of Bosz, Boateng'ssituation hardly changed. Under the new coach Laurent Blanc, he also struggled to play, which lead to his departure from the club in May 2023. He has been without a club ever since. Now he is being considered as an option to fill Bayern's defensive gaps that for a long time the bosses claimed never existed.
The topic of too thin a squad is not a new one at Bayern. This summer, head coach Thomas Tuchel expressed great concerns around Bayern's squad size and whether it was big enough to challenge at the highest level. Time and time again Tuchel mentioned how there was no room for injuries and how ""difficult"" it would be with such a thin squad.
Ahead of the Bundesliga game against Gladbach in September, Tuchel doubled down on his criticism and in doing so positioned himself against Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen. The Bayern boss had told ""Sky"" just before that the squad was ""first class"" and Tuchel had to be a ""bit more creative. That is his job.""
But even creativity has limits. For anyone watching Bayern's German Cup first round game in Münster it was clear that the defensive issues of the summer had not been handled.
With Matthijs de Ligt, Dayot Umapecano and new-signing Min-Jae Kim all out injured, defensive prospect Josip Stanisic surprisingly loaned to Leverkusen and Tarek Buchmann seemingly not yet up to the task of starting for Bayern, Tuchel was out of options. The coach turned to central midfielder Leon Goretzka and wingback Noussair Mazraoui as a makeshift pairing, and in doing so was liked proven right about his concerns around squad depth.
And so Jerome Boatenghas returned to Säbener Straße in an attempt to make up Bayern's biggest error of judgement in the transfer window.
""Bayern is admitting to a mistake: They didn't do their homework in defence as they should have, otherwise they would have had a fourth skilled centre back,"" Germany legend Lothar Matthäus told ""Sky.""
The criticism of Boateng's potential signing extends well beyond his sporting qualities though, as his arrival would be about the person as much as the player.
And in the case of the person, Jerome Boateng recently dealt with court proceedings after accusations of violent attacks on his former girlfriend.
The Bavarian Supreme Court just overturned Boateng's conviction in its entirety because of obvious legal errors. However, the trial will be reopened and then heard for the third time — overshadowing Boateng's potential second stint at Bayern.
In the first two proceedings, the courts considered it proven that Boateng had injured and insulted his then partner during a Caribbean holiday more than three years ago. Boateng was fined €1.8m for assault.
The retrial is due to start in spring 2024.
For Bayern's sporting director Christoph Freund that is not a reason to refrain from signing the 35-year-old.
""Everyone can have their opinion,"" Freund said in response to a critical question from a journalist. ""Our approach is what is best for Bayern in sporting terms."" Boateng's court case was ""a private story"" and therefore ""not a big issue for us"". In addition, ""the presumption of innocence"" always applies.
Thomas Tuchel struck a similar note. ""The presumption of innocence applies when proceedings are suspended,"" he said in the press conference ahead of Bayern's Champions League game in Copenhagen.
""Because that is also the case, we as a football club have the right to make football decisions."" It must be possible to allow ""a deserving player"" to train with us, he continued. ""The doors are always open.""
Not everyone sees it the same way. Bayern have been criticised for its line of justification.  
The ""White Ring"", a non-profit organisation that supports crime victims and prevents crime, wrote on Instagram: ""No, dear FC Bayern, domestic violence is not a private story. Rather, it is a massive social problem.""
Against all odds, the 35-year-old is continuing his training at the club. A decision is to be made by the end of the first week of October on a possible return of the 2014 world champion. Either way, the next few weeks look turbulent for Bayern Munich.

https://www.dw.com/en/egypts-el-sissi-says-hell-run-for-third-presidential-term/a-66985328,POLITICS,Egypt's el-Sissi says he'll run for third presidential term 02.10.2023,"Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi on Monday confirmed expectations by announcing his intention to run in December's presidential election.
""As I have responded to the people's call before, I heed the call now and announce my intention to run and complete the dream in a new presidential term,"" el-Sissi told a cheering crowd of supporters at Cairo's New Administrative Capital — a construction megaproject pushed by the president.
El-Sissi, a former army chief who came to power by ousting Mohamed Morsi — Egypt's elected president — in a 2013 military coup, won the election in 2014 and again in 2018, by 96% and 97% respectively.
Several prominent candidates in the 2018 election were kept off ballots or jailed.
Four years ago, el-Sissi oversaw the adoption of amendments to Egypt's constitution that allowed him to stand for a third term, while at the same time extending presidential terms from four to six years.
If re-elected, the authoritarian leader could remain in power until 2030.
Orchestrated shows of support have been rolled out on a massive scale with banners bearing el-Sissi's likeness blanketing the capital Cairo and enthusiastic coverage of happy el-Sissi supporters being broadcast on state-aligned media.
On Monday, boats on the Nile sported images of el-Sissi and the slogan, ""Yes to Stability"" on their sails.
Though el-Sissi is widely expected to win re-election against an opposition he has largely crushed over the past decade — mainly by jailing tens of thousands under the guise of cracking down on ""dissent"" — Egypt's dire economic straits could make his victory somewhat less overwhelming.
Inflation in Egypt has skyrocketed to nearly 40% and the country's currency has lost half its value since March 2022.
El-Sissi urged Egyptians to cast ballots in the upcoming vote even if they weren't for him, praising opposing candidates and hailing, ""a real beginning to vibrant political life and pluralism.""
Among those daring to challenge el-Sissi is Ahmed al-Tantawi, a critic of the president and a former parliamentarian. Tantawi has accused el-Sissi of harassing his supporters and spying on him.
Rights groups say Tantawi supporters have indeed been detained by police; and the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, after conducting a forensics analysis, said ""with high confidence"" that the el-Sissi government had hacked his phone.
Accusations that Tantawi supporters had been kept from casting support for his candidacy were brushed aside as ""baseless"" by the Egyptian National Election Authority — candidates must gather 25,000 public signatures or the support of 20 parliamentarians in order to qualify for the vote.
Egypt's election is scheduled to take place December 10-12.

https://www.dw.com/en/kanjuruhan-stadium-tragedy-football-fans-demand-answers/a-66982962,SOCCER,Kanjuruhan Stadium tragedy: Football fans demand answers 02.10.2023,"It's been a year since one of the worst-ever disasters in football.
Including victims' families who are demanding justice, a few hundred people took part in a vigil outside the Kanjuruhan Stadium in Malang, Indonesia, to commemorate the 135 supporters killed after the October 1, 2022, derby between rivals Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya. Others took to the streets to peacefully protest, holding up posters with the faces of lost loved ones.
After the game, Arema FC fans rushed onto the pitch, a common occurrence after games in Indonesia. Portuguese centerback Sergio Silva, then at Arema FC, told Portuguese sports newspaper A Bola that the fans looked like they wanted to ""show support rather than attack.""
Police tried to push them back with tear gas and batons, resulting in bottlenecks and a mass panic. More than 400 people were left injured, and the list of deaths included children, one as young as three years old.
According to Indonesia's National Commission on Human Rights, police's indiscriminate use of tear gas was the main cause for the disaster, with the organization's chief calling for ""legal responsibility."" According to the stadium regulations issued by football's global governing body, FIFA, the use of firearms or crowd control gas is prohibited.
Two Indonesian officials and three police officers stood trial and were found guilty, with the jail terms ranging from one year to two and a half.
Despite that, many of the victims' family members feel that the measures taken by the country's government, police and courts did not go far enough.

Sumiarsih, also goes by the name Bu Cece, lost her teenage son during the tragedy. He told DW that many families of the victim still have yet to receive justice for the death of their love ones.
""When it comes to justice, we haven't received it until now because we were never informed before the trials,"" Sumiarsih told DW. 
""Suddenly there's already the result [of the trials]. There has been no transparency and information on the schedule of the trials. Even if we can't go there [to the court], we would like to be informed about it. If we were told, we at least would have felt relieved.""
Sumiarsih also asked about compensation that the victim's family is entitled to, adding that she and some other victim's families are being ping-ponged when asking about it.
Devi Athok lost his two teenage daughters in the disaster. According to the Indonesian man, the police didn't tell the truth about the reasons for its measures, arguing it was because of fights between fans.
""This is a public lie. We are being fooled,"" he told AP.
""If you ask if I have sincerely accepted what happened, yes, I sincerely do. They are dead, they won't come back. But under the law, I seek justice against the killer of my two daughters.""
Many supporters, too, feel not enough has been done in the year since  the disaster. In an open letter, former Arema FC fan collective Arek Malang said that a ""fair trial"" had still not taken place.
""The high-ranking police officers who gave the orders to shoot tear gas remain free,"" the group wrote on the X platform, formerly known as Twitter, adding that no association or league official has stood trial, either.
The group believes Arema FC, too, should also be held to account. The group, formerly known as Aremania due to their support of the club, ""removed all forms of support"" due to its handling of the disaster's aftermath.
""Police violence towards football fans must end,"" the group's open letter concludes.
The group has also called for other fan and ultra groups from around the world to raise awareness for the disaster, and show solidarity with the victims. Many have answered their calls, including two ultra groups from Germany, Stuttgart's Commando Cannstatt, and Carl Zeiss Jena's Horda Azzuro. 
Football games in Germany are statistically safe — only 1,127 injuries were recorded out of almost 19 million stadium visits in 2018 and 2019, the last season ahead of the pandemic  — but research published by the German Research Foundation (DFG) in May, showed that almost a quarter of those asked said they were subjected to police violence in the context of football games.
As a result of their experiences, many of Germany's supporters established legal aid collectives to provide assistance to anyone needing it upon facing the law, and making official complaints in cases of an exaggerated use of force by police.
In Indonesia, such football collectives do not appear to be present, although the country's Legal Aid Foundation (YLBHI) condemned the police's use of force.
The Kanjuruhan Stadium is set to be torn down, but for those in mourning a year on from the tragedy, justice remains elusive.

https://www.dw.com/en/why-rb-leipzig-sacked-max-eberl-before-bayern-munich-game/a-66976066,SPORTS,Why RB Leipzig sacked Max Eberl before Bayern Munich game 01.10.2023,"""I was surprised,"" admitted even RB Leipzig head coach Marco Rose when asked about the dismissal of director of sport Max Eberl just one day earlier.
""I had a very trusting relationship with Max,"" he said after the 2-2 draw with Bayern Munich on Saturday. ""We value each other privately as people and I value him as an absolute expert. But I can't make a judgement on the processes and the developments which led to the decision. It's a shame, but I need to focus on getting the lads to play good, successful football.""
His team had done precisely that for long periods against Bayern, especially in a first half in which RB had hassled and harried the German champions across midfield and in which two new signings, Lois Openda and Castello Lukeba, had given the hosts a deserved half-time lead.
Fellow new arrival Xavi Simons, on loan from Paris Saint-Germain, was again impressive, and Rose knew who to thank.
""Together with the scouting department, [Max] delivered a top transfer period,"" he said, crediting Eberl with successfully negotiating a summer transfer window in which RB had to replace a raft of high-profile departures.
""He played a part in what we were able to produce on the pitch today.""
Thirty hours earlier, however, Eberl had been dismissed after less than 10 months in the job, a club statement accusing him of ""a lack of commitment"" to club and city, widely interpreted to mean a failure on Eberl's part to unequivocally distance himself from persistent rumors linking him with Bayern Munich.
""It was beyond repair,"" said supervisory board chairman Oliver Mintzlaff of the relationship with Eberl, whose appointment in December 2022 he had personally worked on for 18 months previously.
It was a period which wasn't without controversy, beginning with Eberl's tearful departure from Borussia Mönchengladbach citing burnout in January 2022 and culminating in RB paying Gladbach a reported a €2.5m in compensation for Eberl, who was handed a four-year deal.
That, Mintzlaff conceded this weekend, was ""an error of judgement,"" something which began to become clear ""as early as April,"" with frustration growing in Leipzig that Eberl was spending too much time in his native Munich and refusing to quash speculation linking him with Bayern.
""When I was off last year, I had a lot of time to think about where I'd like to work, which club would be exciting, and RB Leipzig was one of them – but so was Bayern Munich, I have to say,"" Eberl let slip at a Sportbild event ahead of last season's German Cup final, where RB defended their title against Eintracht Frankfurt.
""When Uli [Hoeness] calls, I answer,"" he continued. ""Uli and I speak a lot on the phone, that's no secret.""
Bayern, at that time, despite winning an 11th consecutive Bundesliga title, had just dismissed chief executive Oliver Kahn and director of sport Hasan Salihamidzic. The latter role, one which Eberl has long coveted, had suddenly become vacant, but Eberl had signed a contract with RB Leipzig until 2026.
""Eberl backed the wrong horse,"" commented broadcaster Sport1 but, as late as last week, Eberl was still responding to questions about Bayern with non-committal comments. ""I'm under contract at RB Leipzig,"" he told Sportbild, which clearly wasn't strong enough for his bosses.
""The whole executive board felt it wasn't working,"" said Mintzlaff. ""We had hoped that there would have been more conviction. That, after many years at Gladbach, we could go on a long journey together here. Especially given the good work Max and his team have done so far. Which makes it even sadder.""
Later, speaking on ZDF Sportstudio, he added: ""There was no big clash, we didn't argue. On the contrary: Max and I had a very cordial phone call. It was a decision that Max also understood and accepts.""
After halftime on Saturday, RB's first-half intensity dropped off, enabling Harry Kane and Leroy Sané to drag Bayern back into the game and salvage a 2-2 draw which ultimately helped neither team, leaving both adrift of Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen and second-place VfB Stuttgart.
Nevertheless, Kicker opined that ""Eberl's dismissal will not pose a threat to Leipzig's sporting development,"" instead describing the decision as ""a sign of strength."" The magazine added: ""There is no place in the Red Bull football cosmos for someone like Eberl who was not fully committed to the club and his job.""
It was reported on Sunday that RB have no intention of terminating Eberl's contract and will demand compensation from any club wanting to obtain his services. In 2021, RB extracted around €20m from Bayern Munich for then head coach Julian Nagelsmann but the club insisted there has as yet been no contact regarding Eberl.
""If another club approaches us, we'll discuss details, but that's not happened so far,"" confirmed board member Johann Plenge. ""For the time being, we're concentrating on Manchester [City in the Champions League] and Bochum. Then we'll speak to Max.""
At least for the rest of this season, sporting director Rouven Schröder will take the reigns as the new most powerful figure on the sporting side of the club. ""Rouven has our complete trust,"" said Mintzlaff. ""Our support structures are well set up. We've considered these steps very carefully.""
Meanwhile in Munich, honorary president Uli Hoeness also told Kicker on Sunday that he was also ""surprised"" by the timing of Eberl's dismissal but insisted: ""Fact is, there is no agreement in place between Bayern and Max Eberl.""
Despite having just unveiled Christoph Freund as sporting director, Bayern still want to fill the board position of director of sport vacated by Salihamidzic. But these plans, Hoeness said, have nothing to do with developments in Leipzig, where perhaps not everyone was as surprised as Marco Rose after all.",Sports
https://www.dw.com/en/how-sports-are-handling-transgender-women-in-competition/a-66973847,SPORTS,How sports are handling transgender women in competition 01.10.2023,"Discussions about transgender rights and sports have been ongoing among athletes and sports federations for years. In a recent development, an upcoming World Aquatics Swimming World Cup event in Berlin will introduce a new, open category specifically for transgender athletes.
The move comes after transgender swimmer Lia Thomas made a splash in the sport when she won the US collegiate 500-yard freestyle title in 2022. She aims to make it to the 2024 Paris Olympics.
""I'm a woman, just like anybody else on the team,"" she told Sports Illustrated, an American sports magazine. ""I don't know exactly what the future of my swimming will look like after this year, but I would love to continue doing it … I want to swim and compete as who I am.""
World Aquatics (WA) said in a statement three days before the event in Berlin that following the close of registration, ""no entries have been received for the Open Category events.""
Nevertheless, the WA plans to keep working on the open category, saying in a statement it hopes to ""examine the possibility of holding Open Category competitions at Masters events in the future.""
Transgender women are said to have advantages over cisgender women when it comes to strength and endurance despite gender-affirming hormone therapy. Males have greater heart and lung capacity, more muscle mass and lower body fat. This is something that cannot be balanced out, according to a 2020 study by the British Journal of Sports Medicine.
Even after testosterone-suppressing treatment for two years, transgender women drew level with men in push-ups and running speed and outperformed females. The study found that despite testosterone-suppressing hormone treatment, this advantage persisted after the one-year period of testosterone suppression that World Athletics recommends for inclusion in women's events — and, according to other studies, even significantly longer.
In addition to swimmer Lia Thomas, New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard has also attracted attention. Hubbard's gender was assigned male at her birth in 1978. She went through puberty and later had gender-affirming surgery in 2012 at 23 years old.
Since then, she has competed in women's events. In 2021, she became the first trans woman to compete in the Olympics.
The equally prominent case of South African track and field athlete Caster Semenya is different. She is not transgender but intersex and has one of several conditions known as differences in sex development, or DSDs, which cause naturally high testosterone in the typical male range.
Track officials have claimed that her condition amounts to having the typical male XY chromosome pattern and physical traits that make her ""biologically male"" and give her an unfair advantage. Semenya, who was identified as female at birth, raised as a girl and identifies as female, won her case this July in the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled she had been discriminated against by track and field rules that forced her to manipulate her hormone levels to compete medically.
World Aquatics, the international water sports federation, decided in 2022 to exclude trans women from women's races at major events such as the Olympics and World Championships. Exceptions will only be allowed if gender-affirming care was completed before turning 12, meaning before puberty. At the same time, the body committed to creating an open category for all swimmers that will debut at the World Cup event in Berlin starting on October 6 with 50- and 100-meter races in all swimming styles.
In track and field, trans women have not been allowed to compete in women's world ranking competitions since March 31, 2023 if they went through what the governing body World Athletics called ""male puberty."" This rule applies regardless of athletes' current testosterone levels.
On the other hand, testosterone concentration in the blood has long been decisive for the eligibility of women with DSDs like Caster Semenya. The hormone must not exceed a concentration of 2.5 nanomoles per Liter (nmol/L) in the 24 months before the relevant competition. Despite winning her case at the European Court of Human Rights, Semenya has not been able to compete since 2019 because she has refused to artificially suppress her testosterone as the rules require.
At the German Football Association (DFB), regulations concerning trans, intersex and non-binary players stipulate that those whose civil registration documents are marked as ""diverse"" or ""not stated,"" along with those who receive gender-affirming care, ""will in the future be able to decide for themselves whether they should be granted playing rights for a women's or men's team."" This also applies to transgender players ""as long as the sporting activity while taking medication does not affect the health of the person concerned.""
In tennis, current rules allow transgender women to compete in Women's Tennis Association (WTA) events. The players must declare ""that her gender identity is female,"" a declaration that ""cannot be changed ... for a minimum of four years."" Additionally, the players must have undergone hormonal treatment for transitioning and must maintain a testosterone level ""below 10 nmol/L for at least 12 months prior to her first WTA tournament.""
Former tennis star Martina Navratilova absolutely does not understand allowing transgender athletes in women's competitions. When Alicia Rowley, a 56-year-old tennis player, won an over-55 tennis tournament organized by the United States Tennis Association (USTA) in August, Navratilova criticized Rowley's participation in a post on the social media platform X.
""Come on @USTA. Women's tennis is not for failed male athletes — whatever age. This is not right and it is not fair. Would this be allowed at the US Open this month? Just with self ID? I don't think so..."" Navratilova wrote.
Including an open category at the Swimming World Cup event in Berlin drew a different kind of criticism.
""We are baffled that the establishment of a special category is being sold as an inclusion achievement,"" said Mara Geri from the Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany (LSVD). She added that ""forcing"" transgender people into a separate category is much more of ""a step back in the fight for acceptance and equality.""
In football, there is more acceptance of the DFB's decision regarding their transgender policy.
""The DFB underlines the efforts of acceptance and participation of the LGBTQ community in football. Under the new rules, football can prove its function as a role model,"" said Sven Lehmann, Germany's Commissioner for the Acceptance of Sexual and Gender Diversity.

""Palermo was my personal achievement,"" said the 20-year-old world number 23, fondly known as ""Queen Wen"" by her growing army of fans. ""That title [was important] because I did poorly in the previous two Grand Slams and I needed to play some lower-level tournaments to earn more points.
""But this feels different because here I'm representing my country. For the Asian Games we worked hard and did a lot of preparation because we regard this competition as very important.""
Having already racked up 205 medals at the halfway stage in Hangzhou, 107 of them gold, hosts China are making the most of home advantage.
In addition to traditional Asian martial arts such as kung fu (11 golds) and taekwondo (3), the Chinese have also won gold in classic Olympic sports including swimming (28), shooting (12), rowing (11) and gymnastics (8).
At some distance, Japan (28 golds) and South Korea (27) are neck-and-neck in the battle for second place in the medals table, with Uzbekistan, India and Thailand leading the best of the rest.
One discipline in which the hosts haven't had it all their own way, however, is shooting, where India broke the world record in the men's 50m rifle shooting en route to beating China to gold.
Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar, Swapnil Suresh Kusale and Akhil Sheoran secured first place with a total of 1,769 points, six points more than China and eight more than the previous record set by the United States last November.
Their achievement, one of six golds for India so far in shooting in Hangzhou, even earned praise from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
""A stupendous win, prestigious gold and a world record,"" he posted to his 92 million followers on the X platform, formerly known as Twitter. ""They have shown exceptional determination and teamwork.""
It was India's 32nd medal overall.
After featuring as a demonstration sport at the last Asian Games in Jakarta, Indonesia, eSports is making its competitive debut in Hangzhou – and proving wildly popular as the only event for which organizers have had to introduce a lottery system for tickets.
Competition forms vary by genre but gold medals are awarded for each game, with China taking gold in ""Arena of Valor,"" Thailand winning in ""EA Sports FC"" (the football simulation formerly known as ""FIFA"") and South Korea coming out on top in ""Street Fighter V.""
On Friday evening, South Korean star Lee ""Faker"" Sang-hyeok and his teammates beat Taiwan 2-0 in the League of Legends final, winning not only gold but also exemption from military service.
With their country still technically at war with North Korea, all able-bodied South Korean men must serve at least 18 months in the military, but the e-sports pros will now be able to complete their mandatory service in a civilian fashion, doing just three weeks of basic military training before completing 544 hours of community service.
Exemptions from military service are controversial in South Korea, and the idea of gamers earning one has reignited a heated debate.
Seventeen female Afghan athletes are competing in Hangzhou, all of whom are based outside the country due to the Taliban's effective ban on women's sport – including co-flagbearer Kimia Yousofi, who started in the women's 100m heats on Friday.
However, the Australian-based sprinter finished last, 0.03 seconds slower than her personal best of 13.29 and failing to qualify.
""The most important thing for me is to represent our girls in Afghanistan,"" she said, calling on her female compatriots to ""work on themselves, that means read books, everything they need for themselves personally.""
Boxer Khaibar Nooristani provided a more positive result, but not the sort that Afghanistan will have wanted as he tested positive for two banned anabolic steroids and was provisionally suspended by the International Testing Agency (ITA).
""The sample was collected by the ITA at the Asian Games in Hangzhou during an out-of-competition anti-doping control performed on September 21, 2023,"" the body said Thursday, the test coming four days before Nooristani's defeat in the preliminary rounds of the 71kg weight class.
""The athlete has been informed of the case and has been provisionally suspended with immediate effect. He has the right to request the analysis of the B-sample.""
Speaking earlier this week, Mani Jegathesan, an adviser to the Olympic Council of Asia's anti-doping committee, warned that drug cheats at the Games would be rooted out.
""Every participating athlete must understand that they could be picked at any time,"" Jegathesan warned. ""This is the best step to ensuring we have a clean event.""
With about 12,000 athletes at the 19th Asian Games, more competitors than at the Olympics, Jegathesan admitted it is impossible to test them all, but said world or Asian record breakers would be ""prioritized."" They will also home in on athletes if they receive ""intelligence.""

https://www.dw.com/en/cricket-world-cup-politics-and-powerplays/a-66952696,SPORTS,Cricket World Cup: Politics and powerplays 29.09.2023,"The ICC Men's 2023 Cricket World Cup will start on October 5 with a repeat of the previous final, in 2019, between champions England and New Zealand. England won the final in London four years ago by the barest of margins and will be expected to beat a New Zealand side who are always a tough proposition. The final will be on November 19.
There are three established international formats in cricket. The shortest is Twenty20 (20 overs, T20), then One Day Internationals (50 overs, ODI), then Test matches (up to five days). This is an ODI World Cup, the 13th iteration of an event which began in 1975. Australia have won the most trophies, with five. Behind them are India and the West Indies, with two apiece. England, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have all won the trophy once.
There have been several tweaks to the format since the tournament's introduction and this year's edition will see all 10 teams play each other once in a group, with the top four making the semifinals. If teams finish on the same points, the number of wins, followed by net run rate and then results between the sides will be the deciding factors.
India are hosting solo for the first time. They have previously shared hosting duties with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in 2011, with Pakistan and Sri Lanka in 1996 and with Pakistan in 1987.
A partnership with Pakistan would be all but unthinkable at this point in time though. Political tensions have often spilled over on to the field, with tours postponed and frosty relations the norm. Just days before the 2023 tournament, there have been claims of ""unequitable treatment towards Pakistan"" from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) towards India, after a VISA delay meant players were late in entering India. Pakistan's first warmup match against New Zealand will be behind closed doors, with the VISA situation for traveling Pakistani fans still not resolved.
Furthermore, the group stage match between the two sides has been rescheduled for October 14 after police were unable to guarantee security as the original date clashed with the first day of the Hindu festival of Navaratri.
Games will be played across nine venues, from the smallest stadium, the 23,000 HPCA Stadium in Dharashala, to the 132,000 Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedebad, where India and Pakistan will meet.
That vast stadium, named after the Indian Prime Minister, will host most of the headline clashes in the tournament. With an election due in April and concerns about a number of Modi's policies, particularly his treatment of Muslim minorities, there are many who believe the tournament will be used as a political tool to prop up his premiership.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the hosts India, the defending champions England and most prolific winners Australia are the top three favorites, with Pakistan and South Africa the pick of the outsiders.
Weather conditions and familiarity with the pitch often play a big part in cricket so, despite the diverse selection of cities and grounds, India look to have a significant home advantage. Home crowds in the increasingly-powerful cricket-mad nation will also play a part.
For the hosts, it's often been hard to look past Virat Kohli, long the team's biggest star. But fellow batter Shubman Gill is ahead of his compatriot in the ratings and comes in to the tournament in better form.
Other batters to watch include England ODI captain Jos Buttler and returning Test captain Ben Stokes, South Africa's Quentin de Kock, who will look to go out on a high after announcing his retirement from the format, Pakistan's Babar Azam and veteran Australian opener David Warner.
In bowling terms, spinners may well be key at some venues. Afghanistan's Rashid Khan has consistently been among the best of those in this format, while India have added the wily Ravichandran Ashwin to their squad. Australia will rely on the pace of Mitchell Starc and accuracy of Josh Hazelwood, while Pakistan's Shaheen Afridi is the leader of a dangerous bowling attack.
It is perhaps the absence of the West Indies, who won the first two tournaments, that is most surprising in the list of qualified teams.
While Bangladesh's development has stalled a bit in recent years, Afghanistan are a genuine threat to the established sides. Though the International Cricket Council (ICC) player rankings may favor them because they largely play weaker sides and build points more easily, Khan and Mujeeb Ur Rahman are rated in the top five bowlers in the world, while 38-year-old Mohammad Nabi is number 2 in the all-rounder ratings.
However, Afghanistan's place at the World Cup has proved somewhat controversial. The Taliban's seizure of control in 2021 has meant women are not allowed to play sport and the Afghan women's cricket team, just like their football team, has been disbanded. It goes against ICC rules for a country to be without a women's side but the tournament organizers have taken no action.
Australia did, earlier this year, when they pulled out of a scheduled series citing Afghanistan's lack of provision for women. Afghanistan's cricket board described the decision as ""unfair"" and ""pathetic."" The sides meet on November 7 in Mumbai.

https://www.dw.com/en/2024-olympics-why-france-bans-veiled-athletes/a-66946826,SPORTS,2024 Olympics: Why France bans veiled athletes 28.09.2023,"France insists that none of its athletes will be allowed to wear the hijab, or any religious items, during the Olympic Games in Paris next year. The reiteration of national policy comes even though no top-level French athletes wear the head covering. Sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera confirmed last weekend that no member of the country's delegation will be allowed to wear a veil because of France's strict policy of secularism in public life.
""That means a ban on any type of proselytizing. That means absolute neutrality in public services,"" Oudea-Castera told France 3 television. ""The France team will not wear the headscarf.""
In response to a set of questions from DW, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) stated that athletes are only subject to the rules of their sporting federations at the Olympic Games.
""For sporting competitions at Paris 2024, the wearing of the hijab is dependent on the competition regulations set by the relevant International Federation (IF). In the Olympic Village, athletes are free to wear the Hijab at any time,"" an IOC spokesperson wrote.
The French sports ministry told DW: ""In order to apply this constitutional principle, members of the French teams cannot express their opinions and religious beliefs. Thus, one cannot wear the veil (or any other accessory or outfit demonstrating religious affiliation) when representing France in a national or international sporting competition.""
Paris 2024 organizers told DW that rules concerning the wearing of the hijab in French sport extended ""far beyond"" their jurisdiction, adding: ""Our responsibility is to welcome athletes from around the world in the best possible conditions.""  
French law maintains strict secularism, and the issue of religious dress goes to the heart of that. These laws are intended to keep the state neutral in religious matters while guaranteeing citizens the right to freely practice their religion in private. They prohibit wearing religious symbols in some contexts, such as in state schools and by civil servants. It outlawed full-face coverings in 2010.
This year has also seen the ban on the abaya, a loose-fitting dress often worn by Muslim women, in schools.
In June, the Conseil d'Etat (Council of State) affirmed a law banning the hijab in football after a pressure group called Les Hijabeuses and the Human Rights League filed for it to be overturned.
The Council of State supported the FFF's (the French Football Federation) ban and stated that it ""is appropriate and proportionate.""
Les hijabeuses called the decision ""shocking,"" adding that it legitimized ""violence against women, against Islam, which exists in French society"" by excluding those women.
The United Nations Human Rights Office spoke out against the French law's discriminatory effects against women this week.
""No one should impose on a woman what she needs to wear or not wear,"" said the organization's spokeswoman, Marta Hurtado.
She stressed that the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ruled out discriminatory practices.
""Any state party to the convention, in this case France, has an obligation to ... modify social or cultural patterns which are based on the idea of the inferiority or superiority of either sex,"" Hurtado said.
""Discriminatory practices against a group can have harmful consequences,"" she pointed out.
Morocco's Nouhaila Benzina became the first woman to wear the hijab at the FIFA Women's World Cup this year. She played for the Atlas Lionesses, who reached the second round at their first-ever World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.
But it was not long ago that football governing body FIFA lifted its ban on the hijab, declaring it safe to wear during football matches. This came after a Canadian teenager was stopped from playing in a Hijab in 2007. The Iranian women's national team had also been stopped from playing an Olympic qualifier in Jordan in 2011.
US fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad is the most high-profile athlete to have worn the hijab at the Olympic Games. She won a bronze medal in Team Sabre at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro wearing the head covering, which made her a leading voice for diversity and equality in sport.
Other sports disciplines that allow the hijab include weightlifting, taekwondo, volleyball and athletics.

https://www.dw.com/en/st-pauli-to-avoid-youth-football-agents/a-66944781,SOCCER,St. Pauli to avoid youth football agents 28.09.2023,"St. Pauli, a second-division football club based in Hamburg, has revealed it will be taking a different approach to youth football. It announced this week that it will no longer be working with player agents or private agencies in its youth system, preferring instead to cultivate direct relationships with individual players.
""We want to focus on partnership and dialogue with the players, their families and their relatives,"" explained the head of the club's youth academy, Benjamin Liedtke, as St. Pauli officially positioned themselves ""against the commercialization of youth football.""
""This is not a decision aimed against football agents in general,"" said Liedtke. ""It's about putting the focus in youth football on the players and those closest to them, not on agencies and the market.""
From explicit anti-racism and anti-fascism campaigns to anti-sexism initiatives, St. Pauli has long established a reputation for socially progressive attitudes, even in the cut-throat capitalist world of professional football.
In August 2022, following a comprehensive internal review, the club launched a self-styled ""Rebellution"" of its academy system with the tagline: ""Another youth football is possible.""
""We've noticed an over-professionalization of youth football which is too heavily orientated towards adult football,"" said Liedtke at the time. He lamented that, in his opinion, there was too little focus on individual technical and tactical development.
""The individual motives of the player were no longer the main focus,"" he explained. ""It was more about match plans and team tactics. Youth football is becoming increasingly eventified in imitation of professional adult football. This is a bad development and one that we would like to reverse.""
There is support for St. Pauli's stance in sports science, too. ""It's impossible to tell if a child will make it at 10 or 12 anyway,"" Professor Arne Güllich of the Technical University of Kaiserslautern told Spiegel, cautioning: ""Too much specialized training can actually have serious disadvantages for children.""
St. Pauli's change of direction comes at a time when, across Europe, the market for private agencies signing up young footballers is expanding, but the chances of actually making it as a professional are slimmer than ever.
According to new figures obtained by the British newspaper The i this week, 97% of players in Premier League clubs' youth academies never play a single minute of top-flight football, while 70% are not even offered a professional contract.
Of the 4,109 players analyzed, all born between September 1995 and August 2000 and registered in top-tier English academies, only 10% have ever gone on to make more than 20 professional appearances in any of the top four divisions of English football.
Similarly in Germany, only one in 40 players in the under-19 Bundesliga are handed a professional contract, according to figures quoted by Spiegel.
And with the German Football Association (DFB)'s national teams delivering disappointing recent results across the age groups — from the senior men's team's consecutive World Cup group stage exits to the failure of the under-21s to qualify for the 2024 Olympics in Paris — German football is asking itself serious questions about its youth development.
Increasingly, new academies and agencies backed by private capital are stepping into the perceived breach. This is particularly the case in Munich, where a public dispute has erupted between traditional youth football clubs and new private ventures such as the Bavarian Football Academy (BFA). The BFA's backers include Robert Wuttke, the founder of internet dating platform Parship, and former Stuttgart, Schalke, Hannover and Cologne sporting director Horst Heldt.
""We just want to give talent a platform, nothing more,"" Heldt told Spiegel, while Wuttke insists that it's not about making money. On the contrary, he claims that each player costs him around €100 ($105), saying: ""It doesn't add up as a business model.""
Local clubs, on the other hand, claim that their players and youth coaches are effectively being poached by academies which, in exchange for much higher membership fees, can offer better facilities and training from better-paid coaches and the unspoken promise of a professional career.
""In the past, we'd have scouts from professional clubs enquiring about the best three players in a particular year. Now, the 25th best player is being told he can make it, too,"" Michael Franke, chairman of Philipp Lahm's former Munich youth team, told Süddeutsche Zeitung.
""We can't turn back time, but I'd like it if a different model were established.""
Up in Hamburg, by refusing to work with private agencies, St. Pauli may just have launched one.

https://www.dw.com/en/60-years-on-the-porsche-911-remains-a-cultural-icon/a-66930310,CULTURE,"60 years on, the Porsche 911 remains a cultural icon 28.09.2023","Since its creation in 1963, the Porsche 911 has wooed car enthusiasts worldwide, proving its worth on the racetrack and serving as an iconic status symbol over the past decades.
Frank Jung, head of Corporate Archives and History Services at Porsche AG, describes the Stuttgart-manufactured car as ""the heartbeat and core of Porsche to date."" 
Unveiled at the Frankfurt International Motor Show in September 1963 as the Porsche 901, the model's number was quickly changed to 911 since French automotive manufacturer Peugeot owned international rights to all car type numbers with a zero in the middle.
Six decades later, over a million Porsche 911s have rolled out of the assembly lines, with different adjustments over the eight generations of the model. 
Built to this day in Zuffenhausen, a borough of Stuttgart in southern Germany, the sports car gained global recognition by first entering the American market, with the first 911s exported to the US in February 1965. 
""Export was always one of the driving factors behind the success of Porsche 911, especially to the US market in the first place but today worldwide,"" Jung tells DW.


As the 911 is ""the face of Porsche worldwide, this might be one of the reasons why it has that iconic status globally,"" Jung points out. 
The fact that it appears in movies, music videos and artworks and is driven by celebrities has also contributed to the model's desirability.
In ""Downhill Racer"" (1969), Robert Redford plays a professional skier who drives through the Alps in a yellow 911T. 
The first sequence of the 1971 movie ""Le Mans"" shows actor Steve McQueen, known at the time as the ""King of Cool,"" driving a Slate Gray 1970 Porsche 911S. He bought the car after the film shoot for his own collection. 
The plot of ""No Man's Land"" (1987) centers on thieves who exclusively steal Porsche 911s. 
The bombastic 2017 spy thriller ""Atomic Blonde,"" set in East Berlin on the eve of the collapse of the Berlin Wall, features a supporting character driving a modified Type 964 911 Carrera 4.
And a 911 crashes through a showroom glass in the opening scene of the 2000 action heist movie ""Gone in 60 Seconds."" 
Artworks and museum exhibitions worldwide have also paid tribute to the iconic car. 
Recently, Porsche AG has partnered with musicians, artists and designers to diversify the model's reach and brand engagement. Designers have expressed their creativity on different models by designing interiors; artists were invited to showcase different paint jobs.
Numerous past and present music videos feature the car, depicting it as a status symbol and a key ingredient to the ""living large"" lifestyle.
Among them, the music video to Billy Ocean's 1988 classic ""Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car"" has the singer in a Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet.
Notable personalities who drive the Porsche 911 include actor Keanu Reeves, rapper Eminem, model Kendall Jenner, football player David Beckham, basketball legend Michael Jordan, fashion designer Ralph Lauren and pop stars Harry Styles and Justin Bieber.
Comedian Jerry Seinfeld is said to own several 911 sports cars in his collection. 
In Germany, singer Udo Lindenberg, politician Christian Lindner and classical music conductor Christian Thielemann, who has just been named director of Berlin State Opera, are also known as Porsche 911 owners.
An ad to promote the launch of the new 911 S/T and celebrate the 60-year history of the iconic sports car was released in August 2023.
In the video, a famous Portuguese landmark, the Cristo Rei — a statue of Jesus Christ that gazes over the nation's capital, Lisbon — was initially digitally removed from the backdrop in one driving scene, sparking controversy on social media.
Meanwhile, the video has been replaced with a new version, where the statue has reappeared.
""This was a mistake, and we apologize for any offense caused,"" says Porsche in a statement accompanying the re-uploaded YouTube clip.
Beyond its timeless design,  the model continues to evolve through engineering innovations.
Facing the climate crisis, Porsche has pledged that 80% of its lineup would be fully electric by 2030. But the company is also pushing its research and investment in e-fuels in order to maintain one exception: the 911. 
""We will produce the 911 as long as possible with a combustion engine,"" Porsche's e-fuels team leader Karl Dums told press agency Reuters in July this year.
For now, the famous sports car remains an item for the privileged class: The 2024 model costs upwards of €120,000. Yet the car company reports high demand and customers having to wait two years for deliveries.
The most expensive new Porsche 911 sports car sold at auction is the one-off Porsche 911 Sally Special, which fetched the exorbitant price of $3.6 million at the RM Sotheby's Monterey Auction in August 2022.

https://www.dw.com/en/kamila-valieva-olympic-doping-case-in-spotlight/a-66930111,SPORTS,Kamila Valieva Olympic doping case in spotlight 26.09.2023,"The case concerns allegations of doping against Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva. Russia's anti-doping agency RUSADA ruled in January 2023 that Valieva would not be banned from the sport despite a positive doping test in late 2021. RUSADA said it had found that Valieva bore ""no fault or negligence"". 
Despite this finding, it did retroactively disqualify her from the 2022 Russian championships. As a result, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) announced in February 2023 that it would apply to the International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) for a four-year ban, as well as the nullification of all Valieva's results from the date of the positive test forward (December 25, 2021).
It was on February 8, 2022, a day after Russia, including Valieva, won gold in the team competition at the Beijing Games, that her positive test result was made public. The blood sample taken from the then-15-year-old six weeks earlier was found to contain the banned substance trimetazidine. The drug can increase blood flow and thus endurance. RUSADA initially suspended Valieva but lifted the mandatory suspension the following day on appeal.
This was opposed by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), WADA and the International Skating Union (ISU). In summary proceedings, CAS ruled at the time that Valieva would not be banned because the trimetazidine concentration in the sample was low and accidental contamination could not be ruled out. In the case of a 15-year-old, a ""special need for protection"" also applied. Valieva was therefore also allowed to compete in the individual competition, in which she finished fourth.
The Russians claimed that Valieva's positive test was due to contamination. They argued that she had ingested traces of her grandfather's heart medication, which contained trimetazidine, through shared cutlery. They also accused the Stockholm laboratory, where the A sample was tested, of technical errors.
No medals have yet been awarded for the team competition at the Beijing Games. If WADA wins its appeal, Russia stands to be stripped of the victory. If this happens, the United States would be awarded the gold medal, silver would go to Japan and bronze to Canada.
The Valieva case has already resulted in a rule change. The ISU decided in June 2022 to raise the minimum age for all disciplines (figure skating, speed skating, short track) from 15 to 17 years in order to ""protect the physical and mental health and emotional wellbeing of skaters."" In 2023-24, the minimum age is to be raised to 16 – then to 17 for the Olympic season, 2025-26.
Something that has been widely criticized is the fact that the CAS is hearing the case behind closed doors. Rob Koehler, director general of the athletes' association Global Athlete, told German public broadcaster ARD that had the CAS decided to make the hearings public, it would have ensured that there could be ""no backroom deals.""
Because the CAS has ruled in Russia's favor several times in the past, some fear that the fact that the hearings are being held in private could increase the chance of Valieva avoiding a ban.
In Russia, on the other hand, there are fears that Valieva could be made a scapegoat. Either way, the CAS decision will likely be both final and binding.

https://www.dw.com/en/tigst-assefa-marathon-world-record-from-middle-distance/a-66918891,SPORTS,Tigst Assefa: Marathon world record from middle distance 25.09.2023,"Tigst Assefa's performance at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday stunned the sporting world. She chopped more than two minutes off the previous world record set by Brigid Kosgei of Kenya, finishing in just 2:11:53 hours.
While the 2022 Berlin Marathon winner had been among the favorites, nobody expected a performance like that. In fact, nobody even thought a time like that was possible for a woman.
""I wanted to break the marathon world record, but I couldn't imagine that it would result in a time under 2:12,"" Assefa said. ""I am very happy.""
Moments earlier, after she'd crossed the finish line near the German capital's Brandenburg Gate, she crossed herself, sank to her knees, and kissed first the asphalt, then her shoes.
It had been clear from the split times early on in the race that she was on course to set an incredible time. That's despite the fact that by her own account, Assefa had held back in the first half of the race, ""so that I wouldn't be tired in the second half. I was able to put a lot more effort into the second part.""
In fact, Assefa ran the penultimate of the 42 kilometers in 3:03 minutes – a mere four seconds slower than the men's winner, Kenya's world-record holder, Eliud Kipchoge.
It's by no means unheard of for a runner to switch from a shorter distance to the marathon a few years into their careers. Kipchoge was an outstanding 5000-meter runner before turning to the marathon. Britain's Paula Radcliffe was the world's top 5000-meter and 10,000-meter runner before choosing the marathon, in which she would go on to hold the world record from 2003 to 2019 (2:15:25).
However, Assefa's path was more unusual, having started out as a sprinter and middle-distance runner – in the  400 and 800 meters. In 2014, at the age of 17, she ran her best time in the 800, at 1:59:24 minutes. She won bronze the 2013 African junior championship in the 800 and went on to represent Ethiopia at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio.
However, she subsequently opted for the 10-kilometer road race – and later the marathon distance – reportedly because running in spikes caused her Achilles-tendon pain.
While it's clear that Assefa is from the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, it is less clear exactly how old she is. Some sources list her age as 29, while others, like her manager, Gianni Demadonna, say she is 26.
Assefa's coach is Gemedu Dedefo, Ethiopia's ""super coach"" credited with getting the best out of stars such as Haile Gebrselassie, Kenenisa Bekele and Tirunesh Dibaba.
It was just 18 months ago that Assefa competed in a marathon for the first time – the Riyadh Marathon – finishing with a time of 2:34.01 hours. Her second was the 2022 Berlin Marathon six months later, which she completed in a time of just 2:15:37 hours – an improvement of 19 minutes.
Demadonna explained the rapid improvement by, among other things, the fact that she had still been eight kilos (17.6 pounds) overweight at her debut, due to a COVID-19-related forced break.
She trains in Trento in northeastern Italy, among other places, but also in Iten, on the Kenyan plateau, at an altitude of about 2,400 meters (7,874 feet).
What's also unusual about Assefa is the extremely lightweight Adidas shoes that she wears for a marathon. The extra-thick sole is made of a foam that, on the one hand, absorbs the impact of steps on the asphalt, but at the same time releases energy upwards for the next step. In addition, a carbon plate is incorporated into the sole. According to experts, this shoe can shave many seconds or even several minutes off a runner's marathon finishing time. Assefa is one of only 10 female athletes worldwide that Adidas outfits with this model.
This ""miracle shoe,"" though, has a downside; it's completely lacking in durability and loses its performance-enhancing effect after just a few hours – rendering the €500 ($531) footwear essentially useless for most users.
In her homeland, Assefa is already being compared to Ethiopia's greatest marathon runner, Abebe Bikila.
Bikila won Ethiopia's first Olympic gold medal – in the marathon at the 1960 Rome Summer Games. While his time of 2:15:16 hours was much slower than Tigst Assefa's world-record, he was running barefoot through the streets of the Italian capital.

After managing only 49 Premier League starts across five injury-hit seasons with Liverpool, during which time he spent 476 days out injured and missed 86 games, Keita joined Bremen on a free transfer this summer, returning to a league in which he had excelled for RB Leipzig between 2016 and 2018.
Shirts with Keita's name on them became an instant best-seller in the Werder club shop, but the risky nature of the deal appeared to be confirmed when the 28-year-old picked up a hamstring problem ahead of a pre-season game.
""He made an unfortunate movement during the warm-up,"" said sporting director Clemens Fritz, but denied any suggestions that Keita was fundamentally injury-prone, pointing to recent appearances for Guinea against Egypt (90 minutes) and Brazil (74). ""He's just played almost two full internationals, and our training has also been very intense,"" said Fritz.
Keita therefore sat out Werder's first four Bundesliga games and indeed 90 minutes of the fifth against Cologne, with head coach Werner turning instead to another substitute, who made an even greater immediate impact.
Justin Njinmah had only been on the pitch a matter of seconds when he drifted away from Cologne defender Jeff Chabot on the right wing before running in behind to latch onto Senne Lynen's through-ball.
With his first touch of the game, he took the ball into the penalty area and, with his second, he finished calmly passed Marwin Schwäbe to put Bremen 2-1 up and on course for their second win of the season.
""We're very satisfied with him,"" said Werner, who has been aware with Njinmah since working together at second-division club Holstein Kiel. ""He carries out his role well and has once again made the difference for us.""
Because it wasn't the first time this season that the 22-year-old German-Nigerian has made an impact off the bench; after coming on with 14 minutes remaining against Mainz on matchday three, he scored one goal and set up another to cap off a 4-0 win.
Having scored goals in the fourth tier for both Holstein Kiel's and Bremen's reserves, and 18 in the third division for Borussia Dortmund's under-23s, Njinmah is proving a threat at any level – so much so that Dortmund were keen to make his loan deal permanent for around €1m this summer, according to the Weser Kurier.
""We'd like to keep him and are looking to extend his deal,"" BVB U23 head coach Ingo Preuss confirmed to the Ruhr Nachrichten. But, despite a 21-minute substitute appearance for Dortmund in a 0-3 defeat away at RB Leipzig last season, Njinmah wanted a clearer path to the first team squad and opted for a return to Bremen, much to the satisfaction of his teammates.
""Justin's great to throw on, because he's not exactly slow,"" said Bremen captain and former Germany defender Niklas Stark on Saturday. ""As a defender, when you've already been running around for 70 minutes and then another arrow comes off the bench, that's not easy. We're glad we have him, he offers the team great deal.""
Njinmah himself, however, was unavailable for comment. ""He should just concentrate on his football for the time being,"" head coach Werner told a disappointed Sky reporter. ""And that's what he's doing.""
Like Keita, he has time.",Sports
https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-marathon-assefa-smashes-womens-world-record/a-66910173,SPORTS,Berlin Marathon: Assefa smashes women's world record 24.09.2023,"Ethiopia's Tigst Assefa broke the women's marathon world record in Berlin on Sunday, chopping off more than two minutes from the previous best to clock an official time of 2 hours 11 minutes and 53 seconds.
On a day of new records, Eliud Kipchoge became the first man to win five Berlin marathons.
Climate activists had threatened to disrupt the event by running onto the course with buckets of orange paint. However, police quickly intervened and the protesters were taken away, shortly before the race got underway.
Assefa slashed a massive 2:11 minutes off the previous women's world record of 2:14:04, set in 2019 by Kenyan Brigid Kosgei in Chicago.
She also improved her personal best by 3:44 minutes, which she ran in last year's marathon in the German capital.
""I didn't expect to run this fast, that is to say to break 2:12, but it is the result of hard work,"" the new world record holder admitted after the race.
Kenyan Sheila Chepkirui came in second, but was nearly six minutes behind the winner. Magdalena Shauri of Tanzania came third. A record eight women finished the race in under 2 hours and 20 minutes.
Kenyan Kipchoge also repeated his win from last year but was unable to improve upon his world record. The 38-year-old missed his previous best from Berlin 2022 by just over a minute and a half, with a time of  2 hours, 2 minutes, 42 seconds.
Debutants Vincent Kipkemoi of Kenya (2:03:13) and Tadase Takele of Ethiopia (2:03:24) came second and third respectively.
Kipchoge now stands alone as the man with the most Berlin Marathon victories, moving one ahead of the Ethiopian legend Haile Gebrselassie who won four consecutive races in the German capital between 2006 and 2009. Kipchoge's wins have come in 2015, 2017, 2018, 2022 and now in this year's race.
""I always learn from every race and every victory. I'm very happy to win for the fifth time in Berlin,"" Kipchoge said.
The environmental group Last Generation had signaled its intent to disrupt the event, having performed similar stunts with paint in the past. Police and security personnel led away a group of Last Generation activists who entered the course from either side of the road as they tried to block the route shortly before the start of the event. Marathon runners passed streaks of bright orange paint that activists had splashed across the road.
Last week, the environmental group sprayed paint over the Brandenburg Gate. The popular landmark and symbol of Germany is located near the finish of the marathon course.
On Saturday, the marathon organizer warned Last Generation activists against disrupting the event.
Jürgen Lock, the managing director of SCC events, a group that is in charge of the marathon, said he hoped ""nothing untoward happens in terms of a demonstration, but we have plans for such eventualities.""
Lock told reporters they were looking ""forward to an enjoyable and peaceful weekend of sport"" and asked demonstrators ""not to interfere with the events themselves.""

Lock told reporters they were looking ""forward to an enjoyable and peaceful weekend of sport"" and asked demonstrators ""not to interfere with the events themselves.""
Last Generation said earlier this week that the group was going to demonstrate at the marathon. Members disrupted rush-hour traffic at 20 locations across Berlin this week and sprayed the Brandenburg Gate orange last week. 
A group member was sentenced to eight months in prison earlier this week. Members have been previously sentenced to three or four months as well.

Last Generation has been demanding the government to move away from coal and fossil fuels by 2030. Germany aims to be climate-neutral by 2045, but has missed its targets for the last two years.
The group has relied on acts of civil disobedience to pressure the government to move toward a climate-friendly economy, including by gluing themselves to roads and airport tarmac to disrupt traffic.
The Berlin Marathon regularly features star athletes like Eliud Kipchoge, and the 42.195 kilometers (26.21 miles) race path covers the city's iconic neighborhoods, including through the Brandenburg Gate to the finish line.
The event has dozens of live bands to keep spectators and supporters engaged.

Xi said the partnership ""will become an important milestone in the history of bilateral relations,"" without providing any further details.
""Faced with an international situation full of instability and uncertainty, China is willing to continue to work together with Syria, firmly support each other, promote friendly cooperation, and jointly defend international fairness and justice,"" he added.
Assad arrived in China on Thursday, and will attend the opening ceremony of the Asian Games, an international sporting event, in Hangzhou on Saturday. He met with Xi in the eastern Chinese city on Friday afternoon, state media reported. 

Assad is on his first trip outside of the Middle East, other than Russia, since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, following his regime's brutal crackdown on anti-government protesters.
Beijing has long backed Assad's regime, including providing diplomatic support in the UN Security Council, where China is a permanent member, and has used its veto power eight times to block resolutions against Assad's government.
International investigations have implicated Assad in human rights abuses during the war. His regime continues to face Western sanctions.
""China supports Syria's opposition to foreign interference, unilateral bullying ... and will support Syria's reconstruction,"" Xi added, according to Chinese state media.
The visit comes as China expands its influence in the Middle East, which was highlighted by mediating a deal in March between Saudi Arabia and Iran to restore ties and reopen their respective embassies.
In 2022, Syria joined China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which provides infrastructure funding to developing areas, ostensibly in exchange for regional influence.

Assad's first stop was the eastern city of Hangzhou, where he will attend the Asian Games, an international sporting event starting Saturday.
The Syrian leader's office said he was invited to China by Xi and will be accompanied by a high-ranking Syrian delegation. Xi is expected to arrive in Hangzhou on Friday to hold a banquet along with Assad and other heads of state and government attending the games.
It is Assad's first visit to China since the conflict in Syria began in 2011, following Assad's brutal crackdown on anti-government protesters.
The conflict has killed more than half a million people, while displacing millions of civilians and destroying wide swathes of Syria's infrastructure and industry.
Haid Haid, a consulting fellow at London's Chatham House, said Assad's meeting with Xi is expected to focus on trying to secure help in rebuilding Syria, he wrote on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. 
In 2022, Syria joined China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which provides infrastructure funding to developing areas, ostensibly in exchange for regional influence. However, funding for BRI projects in Syria has ""yet to materialize,"" Haid said.
The visit comes as China expands its influence in the Middle East, which was highlighted by mediating a deal in March between Saudi Arabia and Iran to restore ties and reopen their respective embassies.
Beijing has long backed Assad's regime, including providing diplomatic support in the UN Security Council, where China is a permanent member, and has used its veto power eight times to block resolutions against Assad's government.
UN inquiries have implicated Assad as being complicit in committing war crimes during the conflict, which titled in Assad's favor after Russian military intervention in 2015. During the war, Assad became a pariah in the Arab world, while being subjected to Western sanctions.
However, the return of Syria to the Arab League at a summit in Saudi Arabia in May 2023 has been seen as a sign that Assad's isolation is ebbing, and he will keep his grip on power in Syria.

https://www.dw.com/en/ruth-fuchs-gdr-javelin-ace-turned-german-politician-dies/a-66877649,SOCIETY,"Ruth Fuchs, GDR javelin ace turned German politician, dies 20.09.2023","Ruth Fuchs, a two-time East German (GDR) Olympic gold medalist and prominent federal and state politician in Germany, has died at the age of 76, according to her family.
The news was confirmed by political allies from the Left Party in her home state of Thuringia in eastern Germany.
Fuchs, known as ""The Woman With the Iron Arm,"" was the first woman to ever throw a javelin beyond 60 meters (197 feet) and won gold at the 1972 Munich and 1976 Montreal Games.
In a career that spanned from 1967 to 1980, she attained a personal best just shy of 70 meters with a throw of 69.94 — using an older javelin design abandoned in the 1980s that allowed slightly longer throws.
After ending her sports career, Fuchs became a member of East Germany's last parliament in 1990 before becoming a parliamentarian in reunified Germany's Bundestag as a member of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), which later became the Left Party.
Fuchs was the first Olympic medalist to serve in the Bundestag, where she was active until 2002. She then became a member of the state parliament of Thuringia, representing the Left party from 2004 to 2009.
In 1994, Fuchs, who dominated javelin throughout the 1970s, openly admitted that she had used steroids during her career.
Fuchs said that, in her view, the only difference between doping in the East and West was that it had been state-organized in the East, whereas it was a free-for-all in the West.
Fuchs' second husband, coach Karl Hellmann, was known as an East German doping specialist.
In politics, she was known as a ""fighter for equality"" by her colleagues.
Thuringia's Left Party Chairman Dietmar Bartsch released a statement Wednesday on X, formerly Twitter, saying: ""Ruth didn't mince her words. She was reliable, honest. Her heart was in the right place.""
After reunification, Fuchs said of the former East German system: ""Those who don't regret the demise of the GDR don't have a heart — those who want the GDR back don't have a brain.""
Ruth Fuchs died of undisclosed causes at the University Hospital of Jena early Wednesday morning.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-basketball-coach-gordon-herbert-on-world-cup-win/a-66874920,SPORTS,Germany basketball coach Gordon Herbert on World Cup win 20.09.2023,"One of the most memorable moments of Germany's FIBA Basketball World Cup victory came immediately after the team's shock 83-77 win over Serbia in the final earlier this month.
Head coach Gordon Herbert sat on the floor, slumped against a wall, seemingly unsure what to do.
""I was actually looking for a chair to sit on, and I couldn't find a chair. So, I just sat on the floor, and my whole body went a little numb,"" Herbert recalled of the moment to DW.
""I just didn't want to stand anymore for some reason. The emotions of everything being over ... It was just hard to comprehend everything.
""To be honest, I really don't know what happened. I just had to gather myself a little bit, and I wanted to really enjoy the moment because it was a lifetime moment. I was trying to gather my thoughts and enjoy the situation.""
Herbert's reaction, as the German team celebrated wildly in Manila after clinching the title in their first-ever World Cup final, was understandable. 
A semifinal loss in 2002 was the furthest the German team had managed in their previous World Cup history, and as the team pulled off shock victory after shock victory on their path to glory in the Philippines, the support at home grew.
Around 4.6 million people in Germany watched the final on public broadcaster ZDF. The win came hot on the heels of a 113-111 upset of the United States in the semifinals, which caught the public imagination but was only available in Germany on a streaming platform.
For Herbert, born and raised in Canada, focusing on the players as individuals rather than just focusing on the team as a whole was a key to the side's success.
""I worked with a sports psychologist in Canada named Peter Jensen, and he really helped me when I was coaching the Canadian team,"" he explained. ""I always said there's no 'I' in 'team,' but he told me there is an I'' in 'team.'
""We need the individuals. I'm a big believer in setting a goal, creating performance goals, which are daily but also bigger.""
It was vital for him that his team had an identity that everyone felt, which he defined as ""toughness, communication and togetherness.""
""And the players made all of these things happen,"" he said. ""Creating this is one of the most important things we did.""
Having been a professional coach since 1994, Herbert is no stranger to taking charge of pressure moments at the helm of a team.
The 64-year-old was only 35 when he took on his first coaching job at the Finnish club Korihait. While it was a natural career progression for the former forward, he admitted that it was not something he relished.
""When I started coaching and I was younger, I didn't really enjoy it,"" he said. ""It was just the pressure to win that was a lot. I still put more pressure on myself than anybody else.""
""Now I try to enjoy the process and make it enjoyable for the players. I talk about enjoying the situation, enjoy the moment, live the moment.""
""I keep reminding myself I need to do that too. I really focus on the process of how I want to coach. I don't focus on the product. I try to eliminate as much pressure as I can.""

https://www.dw.com/en/julian-nagelsmann-germanys-hope-for-euro-2024/a-66873767,SOCCER,Julian Nagelsmann: Germany's hope for Euro 2024? 20.09.2023,"From star pupil on Germany's famed Fussball-Lehrer (Football Teacher) course less than a decade ago, to the top job in German football. Julian Nagelsmann's trajectory has been rapid — and rising. With multiple media reports saying the former Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig coach is set to take the top job as the choice of DFB (German FA) sporting director Rudi Völler, DW looks at how he reached this point.
A series of knee injuries forced Nagelsmann to hang up his playing boots at the age of 20. At that point, he was playing in Augsburg's reserves under the tutelage of Thomas Tuchel, the former Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain coach who would go on to succeed Nagelsmann at Bayern. Tuchel spotted his young charge's coaching potential and got him on the Augsburg staff before Nagelsmann moved on to a similar assistant coach role at 1860 Munich.
Always ambitious, Nagelsmann had his sights set on a Bundesliga head coach gig from the start and was keen to observe and learn from the likes of Tuchel and Pep Guardiola. He began his training on the Fussball-Lehrer course in 2015 alongside Domenico Tedesco, who would go on to have success at Schalke, and took an opportunity when an interim role arose at struggling Hoffenheim in 2015. After impressing, he was promised the role by the start of the 2016-17 season, only to see his appointment brought forward to the end of 2015-16 due to the ill health of Huub Stevens. At 28, he became the Bundesliga's youngest-ever head coach.
Nagelsmann initially took over with Hoffenheim embroiled in a relegation scrap. After guiding them out of that, he impressed further by leading the team from the small village of Sinsheim, and controversially backed by investor Dietmar Hopp, to the Champions League. A narrow aggregate loss to Liverpool in the Champions League group stage did little to damage his reputation as German coaching's bright young hope and Nagelsmann was named Coach of the Year in 2017, at the end of his first full season.
Though bigger clubs were already sniffing around, Nagelsmann extended his contract with Hoffenheim until 2021. In that season, 2017-18, Hoffenheim finished third, qualifying directly to the Champions League for the first time. But at the end of that season, Nagelsmann felt he'd outgrown the club and left for another controversial side, Red Bull-backed RB Leipzig, one of the few sides with resources to challenge at the top of the Bundesliga consistently.
The move was broadly successful, with Leipzig finishing runners-up to Bayern in 2020-21 and enjoying some decent runs in the Champions League. But it wasn't to last. In 2021, with Flick taking the Germany role, Bayern paid a record €25 million to secure Nagelsmann.
Things started fairly successfully, with a win in the Super Cup followed by the expected Bundesliga title. But a surprise elimination by Villareal in the quarterfinals of the Champions League exposed some cracks that continued to widen the next campaign, as Bayern allowed Borussia Dortmund to gain ground amid rumors that Nagelsmann was distant with his players and had fallen out with senior goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.

Nevertheless, his dismissal in March 2023 was a shock, particularly given the financial package he'd agreed. Bayern were still in with a shout of Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League titles at that point and would eventually win just the Bundesliga after Borussia Dortmund imploded on the final day.
Though Bayern's players sometimes made noises about the complexity of his plans, Nagelsmann's tactical brain has been his greatest strength. He generally plays a style that relies on quick counter-pressing and rapid, short passing. His use of analytics has also been a key factor in his rise, with a giant video screen used at Hoffenheim an early marker of a coach comfortable with innovation.
But it's not just that. ""You have to be a people catcher. As a coach, you have to manage to put the interests of the team first, not the interests of the players,"" he once said in an interview with the daily Süddeutsche Zeitung.
That attitude can cause friction with some players but motivate others. Joshua Kimmich considers him an ""outstanding coach. Easily in the top three of my best coaches."" While his Germany teammates Leon Goretzka and Serge Gnabry both improved under Nagelsmann's tutelage.
It appears a question of the right time and the right place for Germany and Nagelsmann, with the challenge of a home tournament enough to tempt Nagelsmann to sacrifice a return to club football for nine months or so, though he will likely not stay with the national team beyond a home campaign at Euro 2024.
""It is a great honor to be national coach. But there I still have a little time, and I still want to be on the pitch every day and enjoy club soccer,"" he said back in 2020.
At 36, Nagelsmann would be the second-youngest national coach in history after Germany's first coach Otto Nerz. Nerz took the reins from 1926 to 36 and started as a 34-year-old. Expectations will be somewhat higher and his reign will be much shorter, but Nagelsmann looks set to take on the task nonetheless.

https://www.dw.com/en/spain-squad-agree-to-play-after-negotiations/a-66850223,SPORTS,Spain squad agree to play after negotiations 20.09.2023,"The Spanish squad called up by new head coach Montserrat Tome have agreed to play in their two upcoming Nations League matches, as the crisis engulfing Spanish football continues to spiral.
The footballers had previously announced they would boycott playing for the national team after Spain's former soccer federation president Luis Rubiales held Jenni Hermoso's head with both hands and kissed her on the lips during the medal ceremony that followed Spain's win over England in the final of the Women's World Cup in Australia on August 20.
However, it has been reported that Tome, who was only hired on September 8 to replace Jorge Vilda, will be fired following the matches against Sweden on September 22 in Gothenburg and against Switzerland in Cordoba on September 26.
Spanish sources suggest there has been a breakdown in trust between the players and Tome, over the head coach's decision to call-up the players who had specifically said they would not return to national team.
Under Spain's Sport Act, players can be fined or even have their federation licences suspended for refusing a call-up. The threat of sanctions, despite the ongoing boycott, saw the players, politician Víctor Francos - who is the President for the Supreme Council for Sport of Spain (CSD) - and Amanda Gutierrez from labor union FUTPRO convene in Oliva earlier this week.

Following hours of discussions, Francos said a principle of agreement to begin making the structural changes requested by the players within the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) had been reached and 21 of the 23 players called up had agreed to play.
Mapi Leon and Patri Guijjaro, who were also not a part of the World Cup squad, were said not to be in the correct frame of mind to remain with the squad. A monitoring commission of the commitments to be adopted was also agreed to be created - made up of members of the RFEF, the CSD and player representatives.
Details on the full set of commitments were still to be confirmed outside of the meeting, although it was announced that General Secretary Andreu Camps had been fired and in the name of equality 'women' would be dropped from the team name and they would be henceforth known just as the 'Spanish Football Team' in line with the men's side.
Francos had a positive outlook following the initial meeting, saying: ""I'm honest: I think the situation is at a difficult time, but I think it's good news to say that the women's national team will play both games with guarantees.""
Meanwhile, Gutierrez added: ""It is the beginning of a possibility of necessary change in the RFEF and for future generations.""
Despite the reassurances, Leon and Guijjaro admitted they were unable to remain with the team having chosen to not make themselves available for selection since September 2022.
The Barcelona pair missed the World Cup as their requests for structural changes were ignored for almost a year and although the fallout since Spain's victory in the tournament has shifted the landscape, both players felt the call-up to the national team remained inappropriate. 
""The reality is that the situation is different for me and Patri than the rest of our teammates,"" Leon explained. ""It's not been the right way for us to return. We're not in a place to be told: 'Now you're coming back...' It's a process. Changes are happening but they have not been enacted yet.""
""But little by little they are happening and we are happy because the intentions are good, but we need time. We support our teammates, as we have done until now from a distance.""
Guijjaro added: ""They are working on changes and, of course, we stand with our teammates. It's true that it's a different situation for us. It's tough and quite difficult. Being here, after the way everything has happened, mentally we were not ready to stay.""
The squad remain without Hermoso though after she was not selected for ""her own protection"", according to Tome. 
Hermoso then accused the Spanish football federation of trying to ""intimidate and threaten"" players of the national team who recently won the World Cup.
In a statement published on social media, the 33-year-old striker reacted to the federation calling up players who at the time were still boycotting the women's team.
39 players, including 21 members of the squad that won the World Cup last month, had said they would not return to the national team as they did not yet ""feel in a safe space,"" demanding further changes within the federation.
But Tome called up many of them a few days later, forcing the players to reaffirm their boycott the same day. Hermoso said the federation was trying to put pressure on the players.
""The players are certain that this is yet another strategy of division and manipulation to intimidate and threaten us with legal repercussions and economic sanctions,"" she had written.

https://www.dw.com/en/jewish-life-in-germany-europes-rabbis-move-their-headquarters-to-munich/a-65594956,RELIGION,Jewish life in Germany: Europe's rabbis move their headquarters to Munich 19.09.2023,"Some 67 years after the Conference of European Rabbis (CER) was founded in London, the organization has moved its headquarters to the Bavarian capital, Munich, on September 19, 2023. There, it has opened a Center for Jewish Life with educational programs catering mainly to Europe's 1,000 rabbis.
The move was announced on May 9, when CER leaders awarded Bavarian Premier Markus Söder the Harav Lord Jakobovits Prize for his ""outstanding commitment to the protection and promotion of Jewish life in Europe.""
At the end of May 2022, some 500 CER rabbis from more than 40 countries convened in Munich for the first time for their plenary assembly.
Munich is, notoriously, the city where Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler began his rise to power in the 1920s. The Nazis later hailed the city as the ""capital of the movement.""
Germany's third-largest city is also the place where 11 Israeli athletes were killed in a hostage-taking attack by the militant group Black September at the 1972 Olympics.
CER President Pinchas Goldschmidt, the chief rabbi of Moscow until the beginning of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, said when he first heard of the idea to move the headquarters to Munich, it struck him as ""really meshuga"" (Yiddish for ""crazy""). He said for him, Munich was first and foremost ""the city where the Reichspogromnacht was planned,"" referring to the days around November 9, 1938, when across the German Reich synagogues were desecrated, Jews saw their property destroyed, and many were killed.
Now, Goldschmidt speaks of the ""courage of a new beginning,"" as Munich has ""one of the largest and most important Jewish communities in Germany.""
Charlotte Knobloch, 90, the former president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, spoke at the award ceremony for Söder, recalling the attack on the synagogue in the eastern German city of Halle on October 9, 2019, on the Yom Kippur holiday. She spoke of the shock and the fear felt by all Jews in Germany in those hours, including those convening in the Munich synagogue for prayer.
Knobloch said Söder was quick to call her soon after the attack; he then paid a visit to Munich's Jewish community, promising financial help for better protection.
""Your worries are also our worries,"" he said. To this day, Söder will frequently stop by the Munich synagogue, Knobloch said, calling Söder a ""faithful ally of Bavaria's Jewish communities"" and their ""patron saint.""
It was in this context that the announcement was made to move the Conference of European Rabbis from London to Munich back in May 2023. Rabbi Goldschmidt stressed the importance of security concerns, adding that he senses openness and receptiveness to Jewish life in Munich.
The move comes at a time when Jewish life in Germany is becoming more visible and more diverse despite the persistently high number of antisemitic incidents. Liberal, conservative, and Orthodox rabbis are trained and ordained in Germany and then serve in numerous European countries. Jewish voices can more often be heard in public debate and the media.
And there are significant architectural projects completed or underway in several cities across Germany. In Frankfurt, construction is progressing on the Jewish Academy, which, according to its director Doron Kiesel, is scheduled for completion in late 2024 and is due to open in early 2025. And in Cologne, the construction of a new Jewish Museum in the center of the old town has been underway for years.
Berlin historian and Rabbi Andreas Nachama sees these projects as a manifestation of a new dimension of Jewish life in Germany. ""Seventy years ago, there were provisional arrangements,"" he told DW, citing as an example the synagogue on Berlin's Fraenkelufer, which is housed in a wing of the former house of worship that was severely damaged during the November pogroms of 1938 and in World War II. ""Now it's very different,"" he said, pointing out that the new buildings are planned to be permanent and representative.
But Nachama also stressed that he sees new buildings as only ""the exterior"" and that rabbinical schools, Jewish theater, Jewish sports clubs and restaurants are also important.
Andrei Kovacs, the managing director of the 1700 Years of Jewish Life in Germany association, described the new Jewish Center in Munich as ""a great sign and a historic moment for Jewish life in Germany.""
In his acceptance speech, Söder affirmed that Jewish life should be able to develop freely and without fear. ""Anyone who threatens Jewish life and freedom must expect our resistance. We have zero tolerance for intolerance,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/simona-halep-and-the-complex-world-of-anti-doping/a-66846726,SPORTS,Simona Halep and the complex world of anti-doping 19.09.2023,"Seven years on from Maria Sharapova's shocking doping revelations, tennis faces another headline case.
Double Grand Slam champion Simona Halep has been banned for four years by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) for two intentional breaches of anti-doping rules. Halep has denied ever having doped and is appealing the ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
""One thing I can tell you for sure is the way they're handling every situation with any player, any athlete, it's just scary. We're gonna get to a point where we're not even gonna be taking electrolytes,"" world No. 9, Maria Sakkari, told reporters days after the news while competing at the San Diego Open.
Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios responded in stark contrast on social media, saying he runs ""on bananas and Coca-Cola in five set battles. And my record in them speaks for itself,"" before adding that ""maybe players should just stop taking shady sh*t.""
Reportedly, Halep took a supplement recommended to her by a physiotherapist, a common process for an elite athlete, to help with nasal problems. That supplement contained Roxadustat, a substance which is used medically to treat anemia and can therefore increase endurance and recovery. The independent panel looking into Halep's case believed the Romanian's doping to be ""repetitive and sophisticated.""
The ITIA believe Halep's actions were intentional, but with the Romanian saying otherwise the case opens the door to the complex world of doping controls.
""The issue for me is the anti-doping structure, this zero tolerance policy and strict liability. So if it's in your sample, you are responsible no matter how it got there,"" Dr. April Henning, an anti-doping expert, author and assistant professor of Sport Management at Heriot-Watt University in Scotland, told DW.
""Is it possible that it was in a supplement that was contaminated? Yes, of course it is, we know that contamination happens frequently,"" she said.
""A lot of this sport rhetoric seems like anyone who tests positive is painted with the same brush. So if it's unintentional, it doesn't matter, you're still horrible, morally corrupt, a bad person, a terrible athlete and you're cheating. And it's much more nuanced than that,"" she added.
Anti-doping agencies do give athletes a list of banned substances and have improved education for athletes, but a lack of clarity remains.
""Have you looked at the list lately? It's massive and there are things that aren't even listed on there that are included in these very broad categories. And, you know, if you're an athlete and you don't have a degree in chemistry, this can be really, really difficult to understand,"" said Henning.
Many will now consider Halep a doper, a cheat. Perhaps that is the case, but perhaps not.
""If they try to mount a defense, they're sort of told your evidence doesn't matter if it's not a WADA [World Anti-Doping Agency] accredited lab or it's not an unopened container from the same batch, but then what is their defense?"" asked Henning.
""There's a barrier to having anybody else look into it. You can't take a case outside of CAS, so what option do athletes who are accused have? Whether or not she intentionally used it, I don't really care — the process should be a bit fairer. Everyone deserves a defense.""
The lack of knowledge around levels of a substance poses another issue, with the zero-tolerance policy again perceived to be part of the problem.
""I don't think that people really understand how a lot of testing works and what they're looking for,"" said Henning. ""The tiny, tiny concentrations that they can detect might have no functional role in the body and physiologically make no difference whether or not you have it. But then there's also the question of whether they even know what a functional level is? Because loads of the things that are banned haven't really been thoroughly researched for enhancement purposes. So we don't know if it is a case of contamination, it's just zero tolerance.""
Research is a major part of the problem. Henning, who has done some work for WADA, is frustrated by the lack of prevalence studies, those designed to estimate the frequency of a health event in the population at a point in time or over a short period of time.
""Painting one sport as clean and another as dirty is tricky because the perfect, honest answer is that there is a lack of prevalence studies,"" she said, adding that the World Anti-Doping Agency has a research budget that they use to actually contract researchers. ""But they have not invested in prevalence studies.""
An imperfect system won't be changed overnight, but collecting more data, creating sport-specific banned substances rather than one generic list, which is the case for all WADA signatories, and introducing threshold levels are changes Henning believes could be beneficial.
""What is the threshold for Roxadustat? Where is the data and information that tells us at what level it either becomes performance-enhancing or unsafe?"" she said.
The world of anti-doping has come a long way since amphetamines, but in a more globalized, wealthier sports world the controls to make a sport fairer need to match the times.

https://www.dw.com/en/womens-bundesliga-sgs-essen-now-one-of-a-kind/a-66813477,SOCCER,Women's Bundesliga: SGS Essen now one of a kind 17.09.2023,"On one of the final days of SGS Essen's preseason preparations, the first team players are forced to move their training session to a plastic pitch. This is because workers from the city, which owns the facility, had picked that particular day to fertilize the grass pitch. Such inconveniences will happen at a club that don't own their own training facility. Things haven't changed since former Germany midfieder Turid Knaak's days as a youth player at the club more than two decades ago.
""We trained on three different pitches,"" Knaak told DW. ""We trained a lot on artificial turf and in the winter, we had to drive all over the city of Essen.""
SGS Essen are more than just a football team, they're a club that also offer their members the opportunity to take part in several other sports. Both current and former players, like Knaak, stress the fact that there is a family-like atmosphere at the club.
""You felt very comfortable as a football player. What SGS perhaps couldn't offer in terms of professionalism, they made up for in other ways,"" she said.
""You felt well looked after as a player, so you could still perform at a high level.""
Knaak returned to SGS Essen to play in the Bundesliga in 2017. Her three years there were the most successful era in the club's history – with the team finishing in a best-ever fourth place in 2018-19. The following season, SGS reached the final of the German Cup for a second time, losing on penalties to Wolfsburg.
Over the past two decades the club have continued to make progress in many respects, including improvements in athletic training, training management and nutrition. The current major project is the construction of a clubhouse, which is slated for completion next year.
For the club's managing director, Florian Zeutschler, it's important ""that we have the best possible conditions in terms of infrastructure with our training ground and with our training turf. Not compared to other teams, but within our means.""
Essen also has a reputation for giving players as young as 16 or 17 an opportunity to play in the Bundesliga.
""The crucial thing is that we believe in our talented young players and are prepared to take a certain degree of risk,"" Zeutschler said.
""Many teams that have international ambitions are not able to do that. For us, it's a matter of course.""
Among those to get their first Bundesliga games at Essen are Germany players Lea Schüller, Lena Oberdorf and Linda Dallmann. SGS captain Jacqueline Meissner is another good example.
""Back then, I learned a lot from Charline Hartmann, who was more or less my mom here,"" she said of her rookie season in 2011. Now it's Meissner, who the younger players to turn to for guidance.
With Turbine Potsdam having been relegated at the end of last season, SGS are the only club in the Bundesliga that don't have a men's professional outfit behind them. Yet just two seasons ago, SGS were one of four ""independent"" clubs. While many see this as a disadvantage – particularly in financial terms; in Essen, it's simply not a topic of discussion.
""Our overarching credo is to never place the club in jeopardy,"" Zeutschler said. ""We work within the revenue we take in. And we don't spend what we haven't earned.""
The fact that teams with a men's professional club backing them are at a financial advantage is not lost on Tobias Trittel, Women's Football Coordinator at VfL Wolfsburg and chairman of the German FA's (DFB) Women's Bundesliga Committee.
""It's no secret that their ability to invest is usually much greater,"" he said, while noting that professional men's clubs also profit from such arrangements, though not necessarily in financial terms.
""You mustn't forget that the recent development of women's football has also had incredibly positive effects for the professional clubs, like in terms of their image.""
The women's teams under the umbrella of a men's professional club also reap non-fiscal benefits, such as their experience in practical matters, like how to plan a training camp or how to maintain training pitches.
""In these areas, we have now reached the same level that is offered to our men on a daily basis,"" Trittel said of Wolfsburg's women's team.
Women's teams whose clubs are already familiar to fans of men's football help raise awareness of the women's game as a whole. The latest to start their own women's programs have been Borussia Dortmund in 2021 and Hertha Berlin this past summer. But you also have to think investing in a women's team only becomes worth it for a men's club, when they make it to the Women's Bundesliga.
However Zeutschler, the managing director at SGS Essen has his doubts about whether such clubs will have the patience it takes to work their way up to become one of the 12 teams in the topflight.
""The fact that only two teams get promoted (from the second division per year) raises the question as to how long big clubs are prepared to stick it out in the second division, or in the regional league (third tier), to achieve the goal of making it to the Bundesliga.""
SGS Essen, on the other hand, are already there – and they have no intention of going anywhere anytime soon.

https://www.dw.com/en/morocco-earthquake-impacts-countrys-top-golfer/a-66832008,SPORTS,Morocco earthquake impacts country's top golfer 16.09.2023,"It has been over a week since the deadliest earthquake in Morocco since 1960 killed over 2,900 people, left more than 5,500 injured and more missing. Several cultural landmarks have been destroyed or damaged, such as Marrakech's historic red sandstone city wall.
The country is reeling and in desperate need of more international support. Members of the country's football team have donated blood, but other athletes have also been affected.
Ayoub Lguirati is Morocco's best golfer and 2023 Arab Champion, but finding the green was the furthest thing from his mind on September 8.

""In both Marrakech and Casablanca our properties got damaged. In Marrakech, parts of the roof fell at the entrance. In Casablanca we noted some cracks in the walls,"" Lguirati told DW.
Lguirati spent the first few days afterwards with his family, but never lost sight of the needs of his community or the people in dire situations across his country.
""After the earthquake, it was more about checking on each other as humans and coming together to help the highly impacted villages. The professional barrier is removed and only the human part stays,"" he said.
""As a professional golfer, I learned to focus on what I can control and that brings some peace of mind. So as soon as I have helped the impacted families and villages in the mountains I now just follow up on the situation and keep praying for a better situation.""
The country is recovering, albeit slowly, with the help of international and domestic aid agencies but also thanks to the remarkable strength of Moroccan people. ""All Moroccans and the government have shown how strongly we come together when facing adversity. That helped the relief to come faster,"" said Lguirati.
He is hugely modest about his own efforts to help, but it speaks to the generosity of the world's 1,770th best golfer that his first port of call was to take care of those most in need.
Popular golf magazine Golf Monthly said this summer that Morocco was beginning to establish itself as ""a top-class golf destination,"" but the sport remains a long way from having the popularity of football and also lacks history makers such as tennis' Younes El Aynaoui or runner Hicham El Guerrouj.
So when Lguirati returned to training, it was done quietly. Nevertheless, the 29-year-old needed to work with his mental coach to find the right balance between personal and professional life. Returning to life after an earthquake is no easy feat.
""Of course, I am lucky to be surrounded by great people, from my team, the royal federation, my sponsors or all the friends around the country,"" he said.
For lower ranked pros like Lguirati, making big jumps in the rankings without playing in big tournaments is nearly impossible. The grind of the tour and slow progression up the rankings starts by focusing on each stroke in each round of each tournament. Lguirati is not only trying to do that, he's also trying to make sure the people of his country emerge from a devastating disaster.

https://www.dw.com/en/russia-will-stay-infected-with-apathy-until-putin-is-gone/a-66827370,CONFLICTS,Russia will stay 'infected with apathy' until Putin is gone 16.09.2023,"""If you spend all of your time being apathetic, one day they will knock on your door, grab your husband by the collar and in three days time throw him into [Ukraine] where he will be killed,"" said investigative reporter Roman Anin. ""This is exactly the price that people pay for being indifferent toward their own fate and the fate of the country.""
The Moldova-born Russia is one of this year's recipients of the Free Media Award from Germany's Zeit Foundation. And this is only the latest in the string of accolades and awards for the 36-year-old, who is a member of multiple international investigative networks, including the team behind the Panama Papers investigation.
In Russia, Anin's Important Stories (IStories.media) website first drew headlines in 2020 by looking into procurement of ventilation machines during the COVID pandemic. In the same year, they also published a report on one of the most sensitive topics in the country — apparent corruption linked to the family of President Vladimir Putin. Anin was forced to leave Russia the following year.

Speaking with DW in Hamburg, Anin said his audience in Russia is still keen to learn about high-level graft. ""But as a whole, the Russian society cares little about this problem, it's been infected with apathy,"" he said.
Anin himself shows no sign of apathy. He moved to Russia as a teenager, studied journalism in Moscow and in 2006 started working as a sports reporter with the Novaya Gazeta, a paper known for seeing several of its reporters killed under the Putin regime. In 2008, Anin was sent by Novaya Gazeta to cover the brief war between Russia and Georgia, when he joined the outlet's investigative unit.
That position allowed him to work on major stories including tax fraud uncovered by Sergei Magnitsky and corruption surrounding the 2014 Winter Olympics. But he also conducted investigations into people at the highest levels of the Putin regime, such as Putin's friend and billionaire cellist Sergey Roldugin and Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin. In a 2016, Anin wrote an article about Sechin's wife owning a yacht worth $100 million (€94 million). Sechin sued the paper for defamation and won.
Anin is aware that many people find it hard to understand the level of graft happening in the Russian elite.
""Russian society simply lives in colossal misery,"" he told DW's Andreas Brenner in Hamburg. Stories about Putin's castle or his friends' yachts mean little to rural people living ""without flushing toilets in 18th century-like conditions.""
This disconnect is ""nothing to marvel at — even the war was only a concern for a few people until the mobilization started and they started detaining husbands and brothers, sending them to the front with no training, where they simply got killed,"" he added.






Ending the Ukraine war would only be the first step in waking up Russian society, according to the reporter. He believes it would take decades of working with the populace to reform the country. And it would happen only after the death of Putin and the ""collective Putin"" — the clique gathered around the long-ruling Russian president.
""It's impossible to break this apathy under the Putin regime,"" said Anin. ""All the truth about the war needs to be made public, so that the people would simply become aware what horror was happening during those 30 years, with them witnessing it in silence. And those horrors were committed with the unconditional approval of the people. And maybe after that Russia will have some chance to overcome this apathy and start living in a new way.""
Anin was detained by Russian authorities in 2021, and had his Moscow home raided and many of his belongings seized. The official pretext was him being a potential witness in a case of privacy invasion. Colleagues at the Novaya Gazeta described it as a delayed payback for his 2016 Sechin story.
Both Anin and his outlet Important Stories were labeled ""foreign agents."" He is now continuing his investigative work from outside of Russia. Important Stories is still going strong, despite being officially ""undesirable"" under the Russian law — meaning it's illegal to repost their content or even like their posts online.

Anin said he is still able to reach his audience in Russia, as shown by the millions of YouTube views. And if all communication channels end up cut off, he said it would not be ""the greatest tragedy among the tragedies of today.""
""Our task is to tell people what is really happening, what the government is really like, what is actually happening in Ukraine, to tell them about this war being criminal, to tell them how the Russian authorities don't consider the lives of its own citizens and are simply sending hundreds of thousands to slaughter,"" he said.
""And the future of the people depends on the people themselves. If the people in Russia don't want to live differently, don't want to know the truth […] there is nothing we can do.""
Commenting on the way Ukrainians and people of other nations view Russians in light of the war, Anin said he has never experienced distrust from his Ukrainian colleagues. But he also said he would not be insulted.
""Ukrainians and the world today have the right to point a finger at Russians, even the 'good Russians',"" he said. ""We will still be facing it for decades to come, just like Germans were facing it after 1945. Sorry, but we deserve it.""

https://www.dw.com/en/lampedusa-operational-emergency-not-migration-crisis/a-66830589,HUMAN RIGHTS,"Lampedusa: 'Operational emergency,' not 'migration crisis' 16.09.2023","Long lines of migrants and refugees, wearing caps and towels to protect themselves from the blistering September sun, sit flanked on either side of a narrow, rocky lane leading to Contrada Imbriacola, the main migrant reception center on the Italian island of Lampedusa.
Among them are 16-year-old Abubakar Sheriff and his 10-year old brother, Farde, who fled their home in Sierra Leone and reached Lampedusa by boat from Tunisia.
""We've been on this island for four days, have been sleeping outside and not consumed much food or water. We've been living on a couple of biscuits,"" Abubakar told DW. ""There were 48 people on the boat we arrived in from Tunisia on September 13. It was a scary journey and I saw some other boats capsizing. But we got lucky."" 
Together with thousands of other migrants outside the reception center, they're waiting to be put into police vans headed to the Italian island's port. They will then be transferred to Sicily and other parts of Italy for their asylum claims to be processed, as authorities in Lampedusa say they have reached ""a tipping point"" in migration management.
More than 7,000 migrants arrived in Lampedusa on flimsy boats from Tunisia earlier this week, leading the island's mayor, Filippo Mannino, to declare a state of emergency and tell local media that while migrants have always been welcomed, this time Lampedusa ""is in crisis.""
In a statement released on Friday, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said her government intends to take ""immediate extraordinary measures"" to deal with the landings. She said this could include a European mission to stop arrivals, ""a naval mission if necessary."" But Lampedusa, with a population of just 6,000 and a reception center that has a capacity for only 400 migrants, has more immediate problems.
Flavio Di Giacomo, spokesperson for the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM), told DW that while the new arrivals have been overwhelming for the island, this is not a ""migration crisis for Italy.""
""This is mainly an operational emergency for Lampedusa, because in 2015-2016, at the height of Europe's migration crisis, only 8% of migrants arrived in Lampedusa. The others were rescued at sea and transported to Sicily to many ports there,"" he said. ""This year, over 70% of arrivals have been in Lampedusa, with people departing from Tunisia, which is very close to the island.""
Di Giacomo said the Italian government had failed to prepare Lampedusa over the past few years. ""The Italian government had time to increase the reception center's capacity after it was set up in 2008,"" he said. ""Migration is nothing new for the country.""
One of Italy's Pelagie Islands in the Mediterranean, Lampedusa has been the first point of entry to Europe for people fleeing conflict, poverty and war in North Africa and the Middle East for years, due to its geographical proximity to those regions. But the past week's mass arrival of migrants caught local authorities off guard.
""We have never seen anything like what we saw on Wednesday,"" said a local police officer near the asylum reception center.

Showing a cellphone video of several small boats crammed with people arriving at the Lampedusa port, he added, ""2011 was the last time Lampedusa saw something like this."" When the civil war in Libya broke out in 2011, many people fled to Europe through Italy. At the time, Rome declared a ""North Africa emergency.""
Roberto Forin, regional coordinator for Europe at the Mixed Migration Centre, a research center, said the recent spike in arrivals likely had one main driving factor. ""According to our research with refugees and migrants in Tunisia, the interceptions by Tunisian coast guards of boats leaving toward Italy seems to have decreased since the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding in mid-July between the European Union and Tunisia,"" he said. ""But the commission has not yet disbursed the €100 million ($106.6 million) included in the deal.""
The EU-Tunisia deal is meant to prevent irregular migration from North Africa and has been welcomed by EU politicians, including Meloni. But rights groups have questioned whether it will protect migrants. Responding to reporters about the delayed disbursement of funds, the European Commission said on Friday that the disbursement was still a ""work in progress.""
IOM's Giacomo said deals between the EU and North African countries aren't the answer. ""It is a humanitarian emergency right now because migrants are leaving from Tunisia, because many are victims of racial discrimination, assault, and in Libya as well, their rights are being abused,"" he said. ""Some coming from Tunisia are also saying they are coming to Italy to get medical care because of the economic crisis there.
""The solution should be to organize more search-and-rescue at sea, to save people and bring them to safety,"" he added. ""The focus should be on helping Lampedusa save the migrants.""
A group of young migrants from Mali who were sitting near the migrant reception center, with pink tags on their hands indicating the date of their arrival, had a similar view.
""We didn't feel safe in Tunisia,"" they told DW. ""So we paid around €750 to a smuggler in Sfax, Tunisia, who then gave us a dinghy and told us to control it and cross the sea toward Europe. We got to Italy but we don't want to stay here. We want to go to France and play football for that country.""
At a press briefing in Brussels on Wednesday, the European Commission said that 450 staff from Europol, Frontex and the European Union Agency for Asylum have been deployed to the island to assist Italian authorities, and €40 million ($42.6 million) has been provided for transport and other infrastructure needed for to handle the increase in migrant arrivals.
But Italian authorities have said they're alone in dealing with the migrants, with Germany restricting Italy from transferring migrants and France tightening its borders with the country.
Lampedusa Deputy Mayor Attilio Lucia was uncompromising: ""The message that has to get through is that Europe has to wake up because the European Union has been absent for 20 years. Today we give this signal: Lampedusa says 'Enough', the Lampedusians have been suffering for 20 years and we are psychologically destroyed,"" he told DW.
""I understand that this was done mostly for internal politics, whereby governments in France and Germany are afraid of being attacked by far-right parties and therefore preemptively take restrictive measures,"" said Forin. ""On the other hand, it is a measure of the failure of the EU to mediate a permanent and sustainable mechanism. When solidarity is left to voluntary mechanisms between states there is always a risk that, when the stakes are high, solidarity vanishes.""
As politicians and rights groups argue over the right response, Lampedusa locals like Antonello di Malta and his mother feel helping people should be the heart of any deal.
On the night more than 7,000 people arrived on the island, di Malta said his mother called him saying some migrants had come to their house begging for food. ""I had to go out but I didn't feel comfortable hearing about them from my mother. So I came home and we started cooking spaghetti for them. There were 10 of them,"" he told DW, adding that he was disappointed with how the government was handling the situation.
""When I saw them I thought about how I would have felt if they were my sons crying and asking for food,"" said Antonello's mother. ""So I started cooking for them. We Italians were migrants too. We used to also travel from north to south. So we can't get scared of people and we need to help.""
Mohammad still has faith in the Italian locals helping people like him. ""I left horrible conditions in Gambia. It is my first time in Europe and local people here have been nice to me, giving me a cracker or sometimes even spaghetti. I don't know where I will be taken next, but I have not lost hope,"" he told DW.
""I stay strong thinking that one day I will play football for Italy and eventually, my home country Gambia,"" he said. ""That sport gives me joy through all this hardship.""

https://www.dw.com/en/markos-xenophobic-comment-reveals-f1s-diversity-challenge/a-66824775,SPORTS,Marko's xenophobic comment reveals F1's diversity challenge 15.09.2023,"For all of the work being done to increase Formula One's diversity and inclusion, the week building up to the Singapore Grand Prix was a stark reminder of how much more is left to do.
Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko recently explained the reason Red Bull driver Sergio Perez, who is from Mexico, has struggled this season was because ""he is South American and so he is not as focused as Max Verstappen or Sebastian Vettel was.""
Red Bull team principal Christian Horner told Sky Sports that the comments ""weren't right,"" while Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton, the only Black driver on the grid, said: ""This is not something that you just apologize [for] and it is all OK. I think there needs to be more done.""
Marko, who has made comments about Perez before, has since apologized. Perez has also accepted the apology, saying: ""I took his apology because I know Helmut from the personal relationship that we have that he doesn't mean it that way.""
Hamilton, though, doesn't believe a simple sorry is enough.
""To have leaders and people in his position making comments like this is not good for us moving forward,"" Hamilton continued. ""There are a lot of people in the background that really are combating these kind of things, but it is hard to manoeuvre if people at the top have mindsets which stop us from progressing. We still have a lot of work to do to make this a more inclusive environment.""
Two years ago, 'The Hamilton Commission' revealed just how lacking in diversity motorsport is. It highlighted that less than 1% of those working in F1 were from Black backgrounds, as well as the barriers preventing access to education and opportunities for underserved communities. Mission 44, Hamilton's own charity, has worked hard to change this but Marko's comments are a reminder that perhaps the biggest challenge for F1 will be changing the culture.
Sporting Equals, a UK independent body established to promote ethnic diversity in sport, believes Marko's comments highlight the extent of that challenge.
""The overtone of the comment Marko made is that South Americans do not have the right temperament to succeed,"" a spokesperson for the organization told DW.
""If that is his attitude to drivers, what would his attitude be toward senior leadership roles in F1? We see that the more diverse the leadership teams, the more diverse the workforce and athletes. It is a top-down approach if you want to see real change on a structural level.""
Two years on from Hamilton's report, Formula One has still only ever seen two women in the team principal role and has never had a Black team principal. Given that the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) oversees 245 motoring and motorsport club members across 146 countries, which represent 80 million individual members, it's clear that even the diverse world of motorsport is not being represented in leadership roles.
""These comments show that the sport is not yet truly welcoming to ethnically diverse people,"" Sporting Equals continued. ""Even with an apology we can be confident these behaviors will continue until there are consequences and real steps taken to address attitudes. F1 needs to show it is proactively inclusive… If policies are not correct, behaviors won't be correct.""
Last year, Red Bull fired reserve driver Juri Vips after the Estonian used a racial slur on a Twitch stream. This year, after Marko's xenophobic comments, the team did not release a statement, because, as Red Bull team principal Horner explained, Marko ""is not an employee of Red Bull Racing... He's part of the Red Bull wider group.""
 A statement from the FIA said Marko had been ""reminded of his responsibilities as a public figure in motor sport in line with the FIA code of ethics.""
Hamilton has said before that the most valuable achievement in his career would be to change the diversity of motorsport, but it's fair to ask why so often he alone, especially since the retirement of supportive Sebastian Vettel, is taking on this task.
""Sir Lewis Hamilton should not be alone in facing this,"" said the Sporting Equals spokesperson.
""He has been very brave to do this while remaining one of the absolute best drivers to have ever lived and be a consistent winner and champion. To be both an activist and an active athlete is not easy. But he does this very much on his own in the spotlight… We need to see a united approach from the grid that comments like this are not acceptable. It cannot simply fall to the one lone Black voice on the grid.""
Until that changes, Formula One's attempt to be as diverse and inclusive as it claims will likely stall.

https://www.dw.com/en/researchers-reveal-benefits-of-exercise-as-an-antidepressant/a-66815823,HEALTH,Researchers reveal benefits of exercise as an antidepressant 14.09.2023,"The biannual Invictus Games — a multisport competition for wounded, injured and sick soldiers and veterans  — has brought more than 5,000 participants from 21 nations to Düsseldorf.
Many of them have reported dealing with mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress, depression and anxiety, which can often diminish quality of life and lead to further illnesses. Psychotherapy and antidepressant drugs, the most common approaches for treating depression, are not always effective.
Electroconvulsive therapy, a procedure that involves sending small electric currents through the brain, is sometimes used for treatment-resistant or severe depression. It is a very effective treatment in most cases, though it is also considered a major intervention and performed under anesthesia. 
Anti-depression therapy is often combined with sports. Backed up by studies, therapists have long reported that exercise can complement depression therapy. Now, some are asking whether sports alone might be enough for some patients to overcome depression.
If so, patients would no longer have to rely on counseling, which can last for years, and could forgo antidepressants. The advantages are obvious: There would be no side effects — except perhaps for sports injuries such as sprained ankles and sore muscles.
In collaboration with scholars from Australia, Belgium, Britain, Sweden and Brazil, researchers from Potsdam University's Department of Sport and Health Sciences systematically reviewed 41 studies on the subject of exercise and depression for a meta-analysis published in February in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.
The authors conclude that sports can offer ""a further evidence-based treatment option for the large amount of untreated individuals with depression, including individuals who refuse or cannot tolerate medication and/or psychotherapy."" They add, however, that ""given the high heterogeneity and mainly small and selected samples of the included studies, this requires individual decisions involving the treating physician to determine if and which conditions of exercise are the optimal treatment of choice while also recognising the potential synergistic effects of exercise in managing both physical and mental well-being.""
Engaging in sports and exercise of any kind — jogging, cycling, yoga, etc. — triggers the release of endorphins, or feel-good hormones, in the brain. These can help alleviate depression and mood swings.

In addition, exercise has been shown to reduce stress in people who experience depression and people who don't alike. Exercise is also linked to improved sleep quality. This, too, can help alleviate depression, distract from negative thoughts and focus attention on positive sensations. Moreover, exercise can improve brain functionality.
Exercise has also been shown to promote neuroplasticity, or the brain's ability to adapt to new stimuli or information. People with depression often suffer from severely diminished neuroplasticity. 
Engaging in regular intense exercise may offer an opportunity for people with depression who do not want to take antidepressants to alleviate the effects of the disorder.

https://www.dw.com/en/invictus-games-nigerias-athletes-battle-with-trauma/a-66800964,SPORTS,Invictus Games: Nigeria's athletes battle with trauma 14.09.2023,"Dressed in green outfits, Peacemaker Azuegbulam and some Nigerian teammates made their way through the crowd at the Invictus Games. A mixture of chattering school groups, soldiers and yellow-clad volunteers populated the area between the athletics stadium and the large arena in Düsseldorf. The mood is relaxed as, time after time, the Africans stopped for either a selfie or just a short conversation with participants from other nations.
""It's exciting to be here. It's a nice experience,"" Azuegbulam told DW. The day before, the 27-year-old had won the first gold medal for his country in powerlifting.
Like Israel and Colombia, Nigeria is taking part in the sporting event for wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women for the first time. A total of 21 countries are represented in the 2023 edition in Düsseldorf, Germany. Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, launched the event nine years ago.
""We are delighted that these new nations are taking part,"" he said at the opening ceremony, adding that he was paying particular attention to Nigeria because his wife, Meghan, has Nigerian roots.
Azuegbulam, on the other hand, appeared reserved and thoughtful.
""It's not easy,"" he said, describing his situation. In 2020, as a soldier, he was hit by heavy anti-aircraft ammunition during fighting in northern Nigeria and lost his left leg.
""After that, I asked myself what I was living for. Some friends turned their backs on me. It was tough to come to terms with that.""
Teammate Harrison Amuzie, who competes in shot put, table tennis, sitting volleyball and archery, reported something similar. 
""My injury was the absolute low point for me. I felt completely useless,"" he told DW.
Amuzie was severely injured in his shoulder and thigh in an attack on his unit in 2019, and has since been getting around with a walking stick. ""The shame of having to move around on crutches all the time and being unable to do things you used to be able to do was traumatic.""
Both said sport has helped them find their way back to life physically and mentally.
""I have trauma. Many thoughts occupy my mind. Sometimes I feel weak,"" said Azuegbulam.
His participation in the Invictus Games encourages him, though.
Critics have been vocal about the enormous amount of money spent on the Games and the comparatively small number of participants (500). Germany's Defense Ministry alone has provided around €40 million (about $43 million), with further funding from large arms companies such as sponsors Lockheed Martin and Boeing.
""By trivializing the consequences, the Invictus Games also trivializes war,"" said Didem Aydurmus from Germany's socialist Left Party. ""Instead, it would be better to invest more money in disabled sports and rehabilitation programs for people with trauma.""
German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius sees the participation of German athletes differently.
""What the men and women of this country have done for us is not for nothing and must be appreciated accordingly,"" he said.
Such conversations are a long way removed from Amuzie. Under the booming bass in the athletics stadium, he picked up a 7.26 kilogram (16 pound) iron ball for a practice throw, about to compete in the shot put final. There were 22 competitors from countries like Poland, Georgia, the United States and Ukraine.
For Amuzie, though, the competition was only one part of the Games. The biggest positive was something else.
""The Invictus Games are a place where we can come together and exchange ideas. Everyone here has made sacrifices for their country. We share our ups and downs,"" Amuzie said, adding that people have networked and want to stay in touch.
Meanwhile, gold medalist Azuegbulam is making memories in Düsseldorf and sharing them on his Instagram account. ""I'm happy about my medal,"" he said. ""But I also want to inspire other soldiers who have also been injured. We all still have games to play and competitions to compete in.""

https://www.dw.com/en/why-louis-van-gaal-should-be-germany-head-coach/a-66798015,SOCCER,Why Louis van Gaal should be Germany head coach 13.09.2023,"Given the tumultuous past few weeks and months for the German FA (DFB), the choice of Louis van Gaal as the next Germany coach seems counterintuitive.
Let's not forget, this is the man with an endless list of famous quotes and moments ranging from: ""I am the way I am, and it's not easy, but I don't want to change my personality just because others want me to"" to ""I like their [German players] mentality. It's incredible. They are more fantastic than me.""
Even recently, the former Netherlands coach told Dutch public broadcaster NOS he thought Argentina's win against his Dutch side in Qatar was ""premeditated"" so that Lionel Messi could become champion.
It's safe to say that if Germany did appoint van Gaal, the next few months would be no less bumpy than the previous few. But there are enough other factors to suggest it still might be worth it.
""I'm honored to be named a candidate, but no foreigner has ever been chosen Germany coach,"" van Gaal told Sky Sport Germany in the wake of Hansi Flick's dismissal. ""Normally, I won't coach at a club anymore, but a promising country still has a chance to convince me,"" van Gaal said further to the German daily Bild.
And that, combined with DFB President Bernd Neuendorf's admission that the association was ""not ruling out any option — German coach or foreign coach"" the possibility of van Gaal becoming Germany's first-ever non-native coach feels very much alive.
Van Gaal has coached at some of the biggest clubs in the world, including Ajax, Barcelona, Manchester United and Bayern Munich. His two-year stint with the German champions in 2009-2011 might not have ended in European glory, but many believe his work laid the foundation for the success that followed. He also knows how to coach on the international stage, having enjoyed three stints in charge of the Netherlands, most recently in Qatar.
 Bastian Schweinsteiger and Phillip Lahm, who played under the Dutchman at Bayern and won the World Cup with Germany, have publicly offered their support for van Gaal.
""As a coach, Louis van Gaal stands for discipline, order and structure in the way his teams play,"" Lahm told Bild. ""He always conveys this through a very clear speech. At Bayern, he was the right man who shaped the club at the right time with his philosophy. He has a strong personality with a lot of experience, which he has gained in top international football as a club and national team coach.""
His disciplined, somewhat militant style is not for everyone. But it will wipe the slate clean and force players to justify their selection. There are no passengers in a team coached by Louis van Gaal.
Indeed, Germany captain Ilkay Gündogan's recent admission to Sportschau that ""perhaps we need confrontation sometimes. We're all nice lads. At the most successful clubs in the world you get into the thick of things at times"" is perhaps a sign that van Gaal would not just fit but is actually required right now.
Furthermore, at 72 years old, van Gaal would also be perfectly suited to a short-term deal. This would give the DFB plenty of time to plan for a long-term coach building towards the 2026 World Cup. He'd also be a much cheaper option than Julian Nagelsmann, another name on the list but a coach who is still under contract at Bayern Munich despite his dismissal in March. For an association reportedly not in great health this could prove a deciding factor.
The biggest question mark around van Gaal is his health. The Dutchman had successful treatment for prostate cancer in April 2022 but recently admitted in a live TV interview that while he is doing well, the physical toll of surgery and recovery is taking its taxing.
""How am I doing? Well, I had surgery two or three weeks ago,"" he said. ""On September 19, I have to go back again and then everything will be decided — and then a miracle could take place that I am able to go the toilet by myself again.""
Even if that news on September 19 is good, his health will have to be managed given the intensity of the job and his medical history but it would make van Gaal's candidacy all the more realistic.

https://www.dw.com/en/thomas-m%C3%BCller-and-rudi-v%C3%B6ller-help-germany-rediscover-fun-factor/a-66794846,SOCCER,Thomas Müller and Rudi Völler help Germany rediscover fun factor 12.09.2023,"The sight of Rudi Völler on the touchline felt like a throwback to the early 2000s when German football was stumbling its way forward and World Cup glory was something Germany's women knew much more about.
Two decades on, Völler's hair is a little whiter, and the squad's average age is a little young. Still, the former Germany striker once again finds himself at the center of a defining moment in German football history.
For a side facing a fourth straight defeat — something Germany have never experienced since that first World Cup win in 1954 — the 2-1 win against France was very welcomed, but it was the manner of the performance that mattered more. 
Perhaps inevitably, Rudi Völler made sure his Germany side delivered the kind of committed performance that has been absent in recent months. To the delight of the home crowd, every tackle won, corner prevented and shot blocked was celebrated by Germany's players with high fives and chest bumps. Most fittingly, Thomas Müller scored on his 122 appearance, his 45th for Germany.
It would be sensationalist to say that after one night in Dortmund under Völler, Hannes Wolf and Sandro Wagner, Germany had finally turned the corner. But a day after Germany captain Ilkay Gündogan said he and other teammates felt they had ""let Hansi [Flick] down"" because they could not translate his drive into good performances, Germany did look like they were having fun playing football again.
""The fans were with us in Wolfsburg too, and they'd have reveled in a result and game like tonight, but here in Dortmund, it's another level, and this is how it should be,"" said Thomas Müller as he soaked in the post-match atmosphere while talking to ARD.
""We executed things well on the pitch. We were fluid and rewarded ourselves at the right time. When you do that and win, it's a lot of fun."" 
The last time that looked the case was Italy last summer. In the 12 games since, they have steadily declined, weighed down by pressure to perform and represent. By the end, Germany under Hansi Flick began to feel like Germany under Joachim Löw as the familiar sight of a coach lost in his steadfast belief he could still save the team returned. It's why Flick was dismissed and why now the rebuilding must begin.
From a psychological perspective, one might argue that the first step was taken in Dortmund. The joy of play frees the side up to play as they can and have on occasion.
With Völler returning to his sporting director role, having fulfilled his duty and added to his legacy, the stage is set for a new coach to take the side forward. The job is to be filled by the time Germany head to the US in mid-October, which is just a month away, and the task is to build a sense of euphoria around this team ahead of a home European Championships next summer by delivering more of what was on show in Dortmund.
""We beat a world-class team tonight even if it was a friendly, it does us a world of good,"" explained Völler. ""In Wolfsburg, we felt that the supporters want it to come together for us at the EUROs. Here [in Dortmund], we knew we'd have great support from these incredible fans.""
""But tonight, it wasn't all about the result. It was about the way we played, the passion we displayed and the way we were set up — I liked what I saw.""   
Germany have never appointed a foreign coach, but perhaps now is the time. Louis van Gaal offers international experience and knows Germany well. The Dutchman is a favorite among former Bayern Munich stars Bastian Schweinsteiger and Philipp Lahm. Julian Nagelsmann is without a job but still under contract at Bayern — although Uli Hoeness recently suggested the Bundesliga champions wouldn't stand in the way of the young head coach if he wanted it. Whoever is chosen, their primary task will be to create a team out of this talented group of individuals.
""The best teams are those that trust each other fully,"" Gündogan said before the France game. ""We always have a positive atmosphere, but I think we can be better and more unified ... There is some timidness. Not everyone can be the way they are in their private life or at their club. That is noticeable, particularly with younger players who don't have the courage to open up on and off the pitch fully.""
If players don't feel comfortable, then the natural question is, why? Perhaps it's because they don't feel understood — motivational videos of grey geese would support that theory. In Dortmund, Germany looked untroubled by the issue of comfort, perhaps because they had just been asked to play. 
Tonight might have provided a much-needed spark in the form of a positive result. The real quest will be to find someone who can keep the flame burning. The next four weeks will provide the answer, and whoever the new coach is will have nine months to hold on and ensure the European Championships at home is a tournament Germany can look back on proudly.

https://www.dw.com/en/football-player-melanie-leupolz-quits-playing-for-germany/a-66789341,SOCCER,Football player Melanie Leupolz quits playing for Germany 12.09.2023,"Eventually, for Melanie Leupolz, something had to give.
After a mammoth effort to return from giving birth in time for the World Cup, the Germany international has announced that she is calling time on her international career to concentrate on her club, Chelsea, and her son.
""It was important for me to make my way back into the DFB [German Football Association] team after giving birth, and I'm very proud to have played another World Cup for my country,"" Leupolz said in a statement released on Monday.
""The fact that I could experience this with my son made this even more valuable for me. At the same time, however, I noticed that the multiple sources of pressure were draining my energy.
Though far from the first woman to give birth while playing top-level football, Leupolz – along with goalkeeper Almuth Schult – is one of only a handful of players who have done so in the German game.
Though conditions and support for mothers are improving at the top clubs like Chelsea, the demands on the top female players are also increasing. Just two months after the World Cup final, Germany and other European nations are set to kick off the newly formed Nations League.
With Chelsea's domestic season and the Champions League set to begin soon after, the travel, training and lack of any substantial break have forced Leupolz to make a tough choice.
""Now it's time to focus fully on my club, Chelsea,"" she added. ""I want to live up to the highest level there and achieve all sporting goals with my team at 100% energy.""
As the women's game has grown, the willingness of top clubs and nations to help players return to the game after giving birth has moved increasingly out of the shadows and into the spotlight.
Leupolz told DW at the World Cup that the DFB ""has been really open ... the two of us are always welcome, and that's wonderful"" — while Chelsea have offered a specialist pelvic coach and a variety of other experts to help the midfielder in her comeback.
Such support was unusual until very recently. Schult told DW that when she gave birth to twins in 2021, the footballing world was not quite ready.
""I was the first player in about 20 years in Germany who returned from pregnancy to play for the national team [a World Cup qualifier in 2022]. Usually, the thinking was that when you were pregnant, your career was over. So they were not prepared for having children around,"" she said.
Even her club, Champions League finalists Wolfsburg, was unsure: ""For example, the first time I could take them [the twins] to away games or a training camp, there was some kind of fight required.""
For many years, pregnancy usually spelled the end of a top-level career and, lower down the women's footballing pyramid, where money is scarcer and facilities much worse, it still does.
Schult's former Wolfsburg teammate, Sara Björk Gunnarsdottir, won a high-profile case last year that ensured that professional female football players are entitled to maternity leave at two-thirds pay for at least 14 weeks. In addition, clubs are not allowed to discriminate against or sack players because of their pregnancy and must reinstate them after giving birth. 
However, the number of professional players is still relatively low, and short-term contracts are the norm in a game growing quickly from a fairly low base.
While sacrificing international football to extend a club career is not unusual, Leupolz's case is perhaps a testament to the particular difficulties of female footballers who choose to become parents during their careers.
""She is a role model for female footballers and athletes,"" said Joti Chatzialexiou, the DFB's sporting director. ""She has also impressively shown how to return to professional football after pregnancy successfully. I greatly regret her retirement from the national team, but I can understand her reasons.""
Germany's loss will likely be Chelsea's gain, as the London club looks to retain their Women's Super League title and finally win their first Champions League. But, for Leupolz, the greatest beneficiary will surely be her son.

https://www.dw.com/en/whats-behind-germanys-basketball-world-cup-win/a-66762347,SPORTS,What's behind Germany's basketball World Cup win? 11.09.2023,"A tense 83-77 win over Serbia sealed an unlikely maiden basketball World Cup win for Germany on Sunday. It was a triumph some years in the making, and captain Dennis Schröder said he hoped it would become a watershed moment for the sport in his homeland.
""Basketball is a great sport and I hope we can get the respect for what we've done the last two years,"" he said. ""I would like to see every single game on TV [in the future]."" 
Around 4.6 million people watched the final on public broadcaster ZDF in Germany, with the win coming hot on the heels of a 113 - 111 win over the United States , in the semifinal, which caught public imagination but was only available on a streaming platform.
Throughout the tournament even non-basketball fans have been glued to those streams to witness what was almost certainly Germany's greatest-ever achievement in the game.
Simply getting to that semifinal against the Americans had already been a major achievement for the Germans, who hadn't advanced that far at a World Cup since 2002. Similar to the current team, a strong team spirit and a special brand of unity were two of the biggest strengths of that German squad led by NBA superstar Dirk Nowitzki 21 years ago. That team would win bronze, just Germany's second international medal in basketball since a team of less-known players surprised everyone by winning the European title at home in 1993.
""Dirk was the best player in the world,"" Patrick Femerling, one of Nowitzki's teammates at the 2002 FIBA World Championship in Indianapolis told DW.
""But that wasn't the only key to success. The team accepted and embraced their role. Everyone brought their maximum performance to the court.""
Just like at the 2023 FIBA World Cup.
The 2002 team were essentially kept intact in the following few years and in 2005 they won another medal – silver at Eurobasket – after losing to Greece in the final in Belgrade.
After that, things started to come apart, with Germany falling into the doldrums for almost two decades. This changed last year, when under new head coach Gordon Herbert, Germany won bronze at Eurobasket – in which Germany was one of four co-hosts.
""In the past, teams in the Bundesliga (Germany's top league) were relying on an increasing number of foreign players,"" Femerling said. ""As a result, you basically lost two generations of (German) players who didn't see professional basketball as a viable option.""
However, according to Femerling, this has changed in recent years.
""The clubs have been putting more of an emphasis on giving young (German) players an opportunity, and that's definitely one reason we now have a good national team.""
This increased focus on developing young German talent coupled with the hiring of coach Herbert in 2021 are among the main contributing factors to the national team's current success.
""He's a very calm and level-headed coach,"" Femerling said of the 64-year-old Canadian. ""He's a good fit for the team.""
The recipe for success is as simple as can be: continuity and trust. This applies to the coaching and support staff, but particularly to the makeup of the squad. Nine of the players that Herbert won bronze with at last year's Eurobasket are also part of this World Cup team. Also, the Penticton B.C. native who spent most of his career as a player in Finland, demands one thing of himself and his players – complete dedication.
""Without commitment, you can't achieve your goals,"" Herbert said. ""Everyone always talks about achieving goals, but first and foremost you need dedication and sacrifice. And all my players have that commitment.""
The coach sees his main task as truly forming a team, something he puts a lot of time and effort into. Prior to the World Cup he flew to North America to visit Schröder, now of the Toronto Raptors, Orlando Magic brothers Moritz and Franz Wagner, and Daniel Theis of the Indiana Pacers.
Herbert enjoys going out to dinner with his players, opportunities he uses to get to know them not only as players but also as people.
""I didn't know Daniel that well before, so I was really looking forward to the dinner. We had really good conversations,"" Herbert said of his meeting with Theis.
""Gordie knows how to talk to the players. He knows what he's doing,"" Femerling said.""
""And he has a good connection with Dennis, which is very important. So it all fits together very well.""
Dennis Schröder is the captain the undisputed leader of this edition of the national team – a bit like Dirk Nowitzki all those years ago. His good relationship with the coach may be one of the reasons he's been one of the top performers in most of Germany's games.
""I can't explain why things match up this well. He knows exactly what he needs and what he wants. But he also lets everyone in the dressing room know that they are important,"" Schröder said in an interview with the DBB (German basketball association).
Once seen as an ""enfant terrible"" Schröder has matured – both physically and mentally – since leaving Bundesliga outfit Braunschweig to join the NBA's Atlanta Hawks in 2013.
""Dennis has grown up, he had developed very well,"" Femerling said.
""Sometimes his role was very big, as were the expectations of him. But you've been able to see a very good development in the past couple of years.""
But what if the captain has a bad day? Against Latvia in the quarterfinals, Schröder made just four baskets – and not a single three-pointer.
""It was my worst game ever as a basketball player,"" Schröder later admitted on Instagram.
Fortunately for Germany, others, like Franz and Moritz Wagner, Andi Obst or even Johannes Thiemann stepped up.
""We have a lot of quality across the board and the age structure from young to experienced is also very good,"" Femerling said.""This is the best national team we've ever had.""
While it will be years before we can assess whether the direction German basketball has taken is sustainable, Femerling doesn't fear a drop off like the DBB experienced a couple of decades ago.
""I hope that youth work – both male and female – will continue to be pushed and promoted. And that people will continue to reap the benefits.""

https://www.dw.com/en/are-middle-east-investments-in-the-west-a-threat/a-66773511,BUSINESS,Are Middle East investments in the West a threat? 11.09.2023,"When not tempting the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and Karim Benzema to Riyadh for hundreds of millions of euros a year, Saudi Arabia has regularly opened its deep pockets to prop up ailing businesses in the West.
Together with its neighbors the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar, the massive Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) stepped in at the height of the 2008/9 financial crisis to support several Western banks, even as their own economies cratered along with the oil price.
""The Gulf sovereign wealth funds can invest large sums in an unbureaucratic manner, especially when the going gets tough. They've often proved to be white knights for many companies,"" Eckart Woertz, Director of the GIGA Institute for Middle East Studies, told DW.
The Kingdom currently has stakes in Nintendo, Uber, Boeing and Newcastle United Football Club. In June, Golf's PGA Tour agreed on a controversial merger with the Saudi-backed LIV Golf that was denounced by human rights groups.
PIF also owns nearly two-thirds of would-be Tesla rival Lucid Motors, splurging some $5.4 billion (€5.04 billion) over the past five years on a firm that produces less than 10,000 vehicles per year.
The latest investment, albeit much smaller, is Saudi Telecom's (STC) announcement last week that it had built up a 10% stake in Spain's telecommunications giant Telefonica, worth some €2.1 billion ($2.25 billion).
Over the past eight years, Telefonica's market value has shrunk by two-thirds. Price wars for mobile and internet services, investments in new technologies and expansion to new markets have left the Spanish firm with a huge debt pile.
The UAE's phone company e& (formerly Etisalat) this year upped its stake in another major European telecoms firm, Vodafone, from 10% to nearly 15%. Last month, e& said it was considering a further increase to 20%.
The two investments have naturally sparked national security concerns as the Gulf states are autocratic regimes that have a long history of human rights abuses and rampant surveillance of their populations.
Last week, Nadia Calvino, Spain's first deputy prime minister, said the stake in Telefonica would need to be scrutinized ""with the defense of Spain's strategic interests in mind.""
The Madrid government is said to be particularly wary of Telefonica's ties with the country's defense sector.
Britain too is worried whether Vodafone's tie-up with e& could impact the former's $19 billion planned merger with rival Three UK, which is currently being scrutinized by the country's competition watchdog.
Three is owned by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison and the deal could give China — and also the UAE — access to critical UK communications infrastructure. But some analysts think the concerns may be overblown.
""Saudi Arabia does not pursue comparable interests to China or Russia,"" said Woertz. ""While China has been pursuing technology that is already installed here in highly sensitive communications infrastructure, that is not the case with Saudi Arabia. They don't produce high-end technology like China's Huawei.""
Woertz was referring to the ban placed on Huawei and other Chinese tech firms by the United States and many of its allies in recent years. Western intelligence agencies have raised concerns that Chinese wireless networking equipment could contain backdoors that enable surveillance by Beijing.

Amid a global shortage of high-end semiconductors needed to power advanced artificial intelligence language models, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are reported to have been buying up chips made by the US tech company NVIDIA.
The two countries have spoken openly about a desire to become leaders in AI technologies, which many tech leaders have warned could be misused by autocratic regimes. Indeed China has a lead over the rest of the world in surveillance of its 1.4 billion population.
""Human rights defenders and journalists are frequent targets of government crackdowns [in UAE and Saudi Arabia],"" Iverna McGowan, director of the Center for Democracy and Technology's Europe office, told the Financial Times last month. ""Pair this with the fact that we know how AI can have discriminatory impacts, or be used to turbocharge unlawful surveillance. It's a frightening thought.""
Gulf Arab states have hit the headlines recently for their own surveillance prowess. In 2019, Google and Apple removed a popular UAE-based messaging app ToTok, after the New York Times reported that it was being used by Emirati intelligence agencies to spy on users.
The Gulf Arab states also heavily censor the internet, including anti-Islamic content, government critics and liberal issues, including LGBTQ+ rights.
The Gulf countries are also key partners of China's so-called Digital Silk Road (DSR), the technological arm of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that aims to smooth trade between China and much of the rest of the world.
Several analysts have warned that the pervasiveness of Chinese snooping technology in the Middle East will likely pose additional security concerns for the West.

Human rights groups have regularly denounced Saudi Arabia for a practice known as sportswashing — in other words, distracting from its appalling rights record with mega sports deals, like the recent merger of Golf's PGA tour and the massive investment in a Saudi league filled with top footballers from the West. 
""It's been clear for some time that Saudi Arabia was prepared to use vast amounts of money to muscle its way into top-tier golf — just part of a wider effort to become a major sporting power and to try to distract attention from the country's atrocious human rights record,"" said Felix Jakens of Amnesty International UK.
In its latest annual report, the human rights group accused Saudi Arabia of human rights violations including unfair trials, torture in prisons, mass executions and discrimination against women.
While rights concerns are important, and security threats need investigating, GIGA's Woertz said that pragmatism often trumps other issues in business, especially in times of crisis.
""For companies, human rights are not their primary concerns. It is about growing the respective business and as an investor they [Gulf countries] are very useful,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/spain-rubiales-resigns-after-world-cup-kiss/a-66773514,CRIME,Spain: Rubiales resigns after World Cup kiss 10.09.2023,"Luis Rubiales has resigned from his position as president of the Spanish Football Federation, after an unsolicited kiss earned him a slew of accusations of sexual assault, with several probes into the incident.
Rubiales kissed the lips of player Jenni Hermoso after the Women's World Cup final last month, which the footballer said she perceived as sexual assault.

""I'm going to [resign], yes, because I cannot continue my work,"" said Rubiales in an interview with television show ""Piers Morgan Uncensored.""
Calls for Rubiales' resignation have intensified over the past month.

Rubiales had until Sunday rejected accusations of sexual assault, insisting the kiss was ""spontaneous, mutual, euphoric and consensual.""
""[Family and friends] say to me 'Luis, you need to focus on your dignity and continue your life. If not you are going to damage people you love and the sport you love.'""
Hermoso, who last week filed a complaint against him, said the kiss had left her feeling ""vulnerable and like the victim of an assault,"" with a statement on social media describing it as ""an impulsive, macho act, out of place and with no type of consent on my part.""

Rubiales also expanded on his decision in a statement shared on social media.
""After the rapid suspension carried out by FIFA, plus the rest of the proceedings opened against me, it is clear that I will not be able to return to my position,"" he said.
""Insisting on waiting and clinging ... is not going to contribute anything positive, neither to the Federation nor to Spanish football. Among other things, because there are de facto powers that will prevent my return,"" he added.
Rubiales said that he also stepped down as vice president of European football body UEFA. He nevertheless continued to defend himself against accusations of sexual assault.
""I have faith in the truth and I will do everything in my power so that it prevails,"" he wrote.
Several Spanish government ministers, who had supported Hermoso, celebrated the resignation. 
""The feminist country is advancing faster and faster,"" Spain's acting Labour Minister Yolanda Diaz posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. ""The transformation and improvement of our lives is inevitable. We are with you, Jenni, and with all women.""
Spain's Equality Minister Irene Montero meanwhile posted ""it's over.""
Rubiales held Hermoso's head with both hands and kissed her on the lips during the medal ceremony that followed Spain's 1-0 win over England in the final of the Women's World Cup in Australia on August 20.
Spanish public prosecutors on Friday filed a complaint against Rubiales.
Prosecutor Marta Durantez Gil accused Rubiales of sexual assault and possible coercion. The complaint was filed with the High Court, which will then decide whether to press formal charges against the football federation president.
If found guilty of a sexual assault charge, Rubiales could be sentenced to prison for a term between one and four years.
World football governing body FIFA suspended the 46-year-old Rubiales from his post on August 27 for 90 days, pending an investigation.

A Spanish government legal panel overseeing sports has also opened a probe to determine if he abused his authority by kissing Hermoso.

https://www.dw.com/en/football-leaks-hacker-rui-pinto-gets-suspended-prison-sentence/a-66188443,SOCCER,Football Leaks: Hacker Rui Pinto gets suspended prison sentence 10.09.2023,"Rui Pinto, the hacker behind the most extensive information leak in sports history has been handed a 4-year suspended prison sentence by a Lisbon court. Pinto's leak exposed some of the dirtiest secrets in European football.
The court on Monday convicted Pinto on five counts of ""illegitimate access"" to IT systems, three counts of ""correspondence violations"" as well as attempted extortion.
Pinto admitted he used illegal means to obtain documents. He argued that he was a whistleblower acting in the interest of the public.
But presiding judge Margarida Alves told the court that ""the freedom to inform does not justify violations of privacy."" She also said it had been ""clearly established that he was hoping to get money.""
Following the ruling in the first of two cases against Pinto, his lawyer highlighted that the ruling ""recognizes that there was a public service"" in the leaks.
The suspended sentence comes after the ruling had been twice pushed back, first in April and then again in August due to an visit by Pope Francis to attend World Youth Day in Lisbon.
Hailed as a Robin Hood figure, Pinto has explained in the past that he wanted ""to expose the rot in football."" 
From 2015 to 2018, working under the pseudonym of ""John,"" Pinto shared a treasure trove of 18.6 million documents and 1.9 terabytes of data with various media outlets including Der Spiegel in Germany.
The leaked files revealed how agents, intermediaries and clubs, including current Champions League and treble winners Manchester City, were perverting ethical and financial regulations to maximize the personal wealth generated by football.
A ""massive cross-border investigation"" followed, looking into ""the dirty deals that turn the beautiful game into an industry that extracts millions in cash,"" according to media website The Black Sea, part of the European Investigative Collaborations network.
When Der Spiegel asked Pinto, in a rare interview during his time in prison, whether it was all worth it given the charges he was facing, Pinto highlighted ""some results"" in the search for justice. ""Ultimately, you'll have to be patient to judge if it was all worth it.""
The Football Leaks revelations initially led to several clients of Portuguese super-agent Jorge Mendes being investigated for tax evasion, including Cristiano Ronaldo. 
The five-time Ballon d'Or winner was forced to pay the Spanish tax authorities over €18 million ($20 million) in 2019 after admitting he had committed a ""voluntary and conscious breach of his fiscal obligations."" 
While some of Europe's biggest football clubs also felt the impact, few have been hit as hard as Manchester City. The Premier League charged the club with numerous breaches of financial regulations in February.
The 34-year-old hacker was arrested in Budapest in 2019 and extradited in 2020 to face trial in his home country of Portugal, where he spent a brief spell in prison before being released in August of that year. 
Pinto is facing 89 hacking charges and an additional charge of attempted extortion, a crime punishable by two to 10 years in prison in Portugal.
During evidence, Pinto told the court he should be given protective status as a whistleblower. But while Football Leaks did uncover punishable breaches of the law, Pinto admitted to hacking and expressed remorse for an alleged attempt at blackmailing Nelio Lucas, the public face of investment fund Doyen Sports.

Pinto said he was ""outraged by what I discovered, and I decided to make it public — I never did anything for money."" But he recognized that his ""conduct could be framed as extortion.""
The trial also heard that his alleged victims included top Portuguese football club Sporting Lisbon and the Portuguese Football Federation.
On July 4, the Portuguese Public Ministry opened a new case against Pinto, in which he is facing 377 separate charges.
The indictment states that 202 offences are for qualified unlawful access, 134 for violation of correspondence, 23 for aggravated violation of correspondence and 18 for computer damage.
Most of the charges are reported to pertain to Pinto accessing and subsequently sending confidential emails from Portuguese football club Benfica to the director of communications at rival outfit Porto, Francisco Marques. 
""The investigation is not finished, and it is unlikely that the criminal police body which was assigned the task of carrying it out will finalize it in the coming months,"" Vera Camacho, of the Public Prosecution Service, wrote in the indictment.
In a statement made by Pinto's lawyers on his behalf, they claim ""the indictment is part of the prosecution's strategy to perpetuate Pinto's judicial career.""
Pinto said he was also behind the Luanda Leaks, a trove of 715,000 emails, contracts, audits and other documents that explain how Isabel dos Santos, daughter of late Angolan dictator Jose dos Santos, built a business empire and became the wealthiest woman in Africa.

https://www.dw.com/en/saudi-arabia-will-football-stars-have-a-political-impact/a-66728542,POLITICS,Saudi Arabia: Will football stars have a political impact? 10.09.2023,"Last week, German professional footballer Toni Kroos told journalists that Saudi Arabia was ruining the game of soccer.
The former German national player was not alone in this complaint. Sports commentators and fans alike have criticized the fact that Saudi Arabia has recently been enticing some of the world's most famous football players to its domestic league with extravagant multi-million dollar salaries.
Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo, Brazil's Neymar, French striker Karim Benzema, Sadio Mane of Senegal and a number of others have all taken up contracts with teams in the Saudi football league. It is estimated their various deals might top $1 billion (€926 million) in salaries for around 20 international players.
""In the end, it's a decision about money — and against football,"" Kroos said of the players who had left for Saudi Arabia, during an August interview with the German edition of Sports Illustrated magazine. ""And from that point, it starts to get difficult for the football we all know and love.""
But could football also make life for Saudi Arabia's autocratic government more difficult? After all, the increased international scrutiny that comes with such high profile players also means more attention on the way Saudi Arabia is ruled as a monarchy, as well as its dire human rights record. Kroos himself said he wouldn't go to the Saudi league because of the human rights situation there.
Saudi Arabia's concerted campaign to play a much bigger role in international football is part of the oil-rich Gulf state's ambitious Vision 2030 plan. This aims to diversify the country's economy away from oil income and into sectors like tourism and entertainment.
Through various financial vehicles and sponsorships, the Saudis have also invested huge amounts in everything from golf, cricket, cycling, Formula One, tennis, wrestling and most recently, mixed martial arts.
Football wasn't always on the agenda. As James Dorsey, an expert on football in the Middle East, has noted, the first consultants to work on Saudi Arabia's national sports strategy were told to focus on individual sports — like tennis or golf — rather than team sports.
""De-emphasizing team sports was intended to limit soccer's potential as a venue for anti-government protests,"" Dorsey, a senior fellow at the Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and the author of the syndicated newsletter, ""The Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer"" wrote in an August column.
There are plenty of historical examples of how football can be politically troublesome in the region.
In 1958, during the Algerian campaign for independence from colonial power, France, some of the best Algerian players caused controversy by defecting from the French football league to form their own, independent national team.
In 2000, Libyan football fans stormed the pitch in Benghazi after an unfair game against a club owned by the son of dictator Moammar Gadhafi.
In 2011, hard core football fans in Egypt known as ""ultras"" played a significant role in the revolution that eventually toppled the country's long-standing dictator, Hosni Mubarak. And most recently, Qatar changed its own labor laws after international criticism before and during the 2022 football World Cup, which it hosted.
Despite such examples, the advisory to steer clear of team sports seems to have been ditched after 2018, when Saudi Arabia's ambitious Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman cemented his hold on power.
The Saudi government now says its focus on football is about economic diversification, locals' health — over 60% of Saudi nationals are obese or overweight — and developing sporting infrastructure. Human rights activists disagree, arguing it's about ""sportswashing,"" the practice of using sports events as a way of distracting from such things as a country's repressive politics.
The answer most likely lies somewhere in the middle: The Saudi sports strategy is motivated by both internal and external political considerations.
Around two-thirds of the Saudi population is under 35 and football is the country's favorite sport. ""So I think that he [Mohammed bin Salman] realized you can't really build a sports sector without football,"" Dorsey suggested. ""He has to deliver on jobs and economic sustainability and sports is part of that. There are also non-economic factors,"" he continued.
""To reduce the risk of challenges … most autocrats rely on a combination of repression, legitimation and co-optation,"" the authors of a 2022 paper, International Sports Events and Repression in Autocracies, published in the American Political Science Review, explained.
""So they're using [football] for both legitimacy and, to some degree, co-optation purposes,"" Adam Scharpf, one of the study's authors and an assistant professor of political science at the University of Copenhagen, told DW. 
Having the world' best footballers playing in the country's own league impresses citizens and demonstrates that the country can play as an equal on the world stage, Scharpf said. ""Of course, you also have repression. And this is all combined in a strategic way.""
It's something of a ""bread and circuses"" situation, both Dorsey and Scharpf agreed, referring to the ancient Roman adage that basically says when citizens are entertained and well fed, they won't bother with politics.
""Essentially, what the government is now doing is saying: 'Well, if you want Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, we'll give them to you.'"" Simon Chadwick, a professor at the Skema business school in France, who specializes in the links between sports and politics, told The Athletic, a sports publication, in June. ""But the flip side to that is they do not want to be questioned. So far this year, there have been more arrests of people in Saudi Arabia for posting negative comments about the government than ever before. The contract is that you can have whatever you want, but don't question us.""
After looking in detail at the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, Scharpf and other researchers concluded that autocratic regimes are well aware of the double-edged nature of large sporting events and deliberately devise strategies to deal with those. These may include increased violence before and after an event and increased surveillance. 
""So in many ways, the sports event doesn't make things better for people living in the country, it makes them worse,"" Scharpf said.
In fact, despite all of the optimism about sports being a catalyst for positive social change, football is just a tool, Dorsey argued. Whether or not it brings change depends on circumstances and how political leaders choose to use it.
""In 2011, when football fans played a major role in Egypt, there were several pre-existing conditions,"" he explained. ""You had widespread discontent and the stadium was one of the few places where that discontent could be voiced and where people had a sense of strength and numbers. Are those circumstances theoretically possible in Saudi Arabia? Sure. Is there any indication that's a realistic scenario anytime soon? Absolutely not.""
Of course, football might still play a positive role at a personal or societal level. However when it comes to nationwide politics, neither Scharpf nor Dorsey think football is about to have any impact in Saudi Arabia. In fact, as Scharpf pointed out, he doesn't know of any robust scientific studies anywhere that show sport helps bring about political change at the top.
A brief search using Google offers another, albeit pretty unscientific, answer as to whether the Saudi strategy on football is succeeding at an international level.
A date-restricted search turns up around 10 English-language news headlines about Mohammed al-Ghamdi, the retired Saudi teacher recently sentenced to death for posting political opinions on X (formerly known as Twitter). That's in the week since Human Rights Watch issued a statement on his case.
In that same time frame, there were over 1,000 news headlines featuring the name of British football player, Jordan Henderson, one of the most recent high-profile recruits to the Saudi league.

https://www.dw.com/en/olaf-scholz-economic-germany-pact-substance-or-spin/a-66760071,POLITICS,Olaf Scholz' economic 'Germany pact': Substance or spin? 10.09.2023,"Things are not going well in Germany. The country's economic power is weakening. Industry is struggling amid high energy costs and too much bureaucracy; companies' order books are emptying out. The progress of digitalization is sluggish, infrastructure is dilapidated, and the construction industry has outright collapsed. Inflation has sent prices soaring, people are buying less.
Economic research institutes have revised their outlooks for Germany — downwards. The recession forecast a couple of weeks ago is set to be much worse than expected. The British magazine The Economist recently posed the question of whether Germany was once again ""the sick man of Europe.""
These are problems the German government cannot ignore, but in recent weeks Chancellor Olaf Scholz has not seemed particularly worried. ""Difficulties are being talked up which have nothing to do with the real strength of the German economy,"" he said at an Augsburger Allgemeine event in August.
Scholz's message up till now has been that his government — a coalition of his center-left Social Democrats (SPD), the environmentalist Greens and the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) — has launched numerous draft laws focused on securing Germany's energy supply and creating more skilled workers. Now Germans just need to be patient while these big plans bear fruit.

That makes the chancellor's performance in the Bundestag parliament on Wednesday, when he defended his government's proposed budget, all the more surprising. Scholz had changed not only in appearance — sporting a black eye patch and scratched face, the result of a jogging injury sustained earlier in the week — but in attitude. Instead of patience, he was suddenly demanding urgency. ""The citizens are fed up with this standstill, and I am too,"" he told the assembled lawmakers in the much-anticipated ""general debate.""
The chancellor called for a ""national effort"" to get Germany ""whipped into shape again."" To do so, everyone needed to cooperate and pull together: the federal government, the state governments, the city and municipal authorities, as well as companies, business associations, trade unions, and what Scholz called the ""democratic opposition"" — by which he meant all the major political parties that weren't the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Scholz named his new initiative his ""Deutschlandpakt,"" or ""Germany pact."" Together the country must ""shake off red tape, risk averseness and despondency,"" because these ""paralyze our economy and frustrate the people in the country who simply want Germany to function properly.""
In response to this call-to-arms, the conservative opposition parties in the Bundestag — comprising the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian ally the Christian Social Union (CSU) — concluded that the chancellor must be unable to accomplish his plans himself and is using the ""Germany pact"" in an attempt to build new majorities.
""If large parts of your coalition has gone missing then we are, of course, available,"" the CSU politician and former Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said in the Bundestag.
However, Scholz' call for solidarity is directed more toward the states and local authorities than the opposition. That is because under Germany's federal system, the national government in Berlin depends on state governments in many policy areas. It is not only the Bundestag that decides on planned legislation, but in many cases also the Bundesrat — the parliamentary body that represents the 16 federal states.
That is why the swift reaction from the state premier of North-Rhine Westphalia carries some weight. Hendrik Wüst of the CDU was outraged at the chancellor's proposal. The ""Germany pact"" was no more than a ""PR (public relations) gag,"" he said, before declaring that, as a state premier, he felt he was being taken for a fool.
As far as Wüst is concerned, Scholz's new goals and actions are nothing new. In fact, the bills listed by Scholz in the Bundestag correspond with what his cabinet launched following a behind-closed-doors meeting in Meseberg in late August. Speeding up planned infrastructure projects, said Wüst, is something the federal states have long called for. ""For months, there was no response from the chancellery,"" he said. ""The federal government has wasted valuable time — to the detriment of Germany as a place for doing business.""
Similar tones are coming from the business community. ""With the announced Germany Pact, the German government is finally waking up,"" said Rainer Dulger, President of the Confederation of German Employers' Associations (BDA), in a newspaper interview. For too long, he said, the government had been sluggish on digitalization and clung to bureaucratic hurdles that were hampering business. This must now change quickly, he said.
In contrast, Olaf Scholz has received broad support from the premiers of the states where the SPD is in power. Following a conference of the state leaders in Brussels, Brandenburg State Premier Dietmar Woidke said there was complete agreement that: ""In Germany we are too complicated, we are too slow and in the end that makes us too expensive. We need to become simpler and quicker."" Woidke is hoping for a new impetus in expanding railway lines, among other things. ""The states will sit down with the federal government as soon as possible so that concrete decisions can finally be made.""

More than 500 competitors from 21 countries are taking part in the contest, which gets underway as Germany swelters under temperatures of over 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit).
Harry told the 20,000-strong audience inside Düsseldorf's Merkur Spiel-Arena that the games were about showcasing respect and appreciation.
""Look at your uniform,"" he said. ""This may no longer be a camouflage suit, but you again have a flag on your shoulder or your chest. You and your families — you're part of a team again."" 
The son of King Charles III was accompanied by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius at the opening ceremony as the national teams filed into the arena. There are 38 men and women representing Germany this year. 
Pistorius told the crowd that the athletes in the competition were impressive role models. ""You are proof that there is always a way forward,"" he said.
He also called on continued support for Ukraine to fend of Russia's invasion, saying backing was needed ""as long as it takes."" 
Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is attending the G20 summit in New Delhi, sent a video message, while US rapper Macklemore put on a concert.
The sports event was created for war veterans who have been injured in battle and has been taking place roughly every two years since 2014. It's the first time it's being hosted by Germany.
According to the Invictus Games website, the goal of the event is to ""give soldiers who are wounded, injured or ill in body and soul a greater awareness and recognition in society and to support their path to rehabilitation.""
More than half of the 500 veterans competing suffer from the psychological effects of battle, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, the website adds.
Earlier in the day, Harry was welcomed by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius and Düsseldorf Mayor Stephan Keller at the town hall, where he signed the city's Golden Book.
Meanwhile, a small group of anti-war protesters gathered nearby under the motto: ""Don't advertise killing,"" holding various placards in German and English.
Competitive events in the Invictus Games, which includes events in 10 disciplines, begin on Sunday and wrap up on September 16. Prince Harry was expected to remain in Germany until the competition's conclusion.
Harry himself served a 20-week tour spanning 2012 and 2013 in Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter copilot gunner. He launched the first Invictus Games in London in 2014.

https://www.dw.com/en/luis-rubiales-prosecutors-file-sexual-assault-complaint/a-66761505,CRIME,Luis Rubiales: Prosecutors file sexual assault complaint 08.09.2023,"Spanish public prosecutors on Friday filed a complaint against suspended football chief Luis Rubiales over his allegedly unsolicited kiss on the lips of player Jenni Hermoso after the Women's World Cup final last month.
Prosecutor Marta Durantez Gil accused Rubiales of sexual assault and possible coercion. The complaint was filed with the High Court, which will then decide whether to press formal charges against the football federation president.
If found guilty of a sexual assault charge, Rubiales could be sentenced to prison for a term between one and four years.
The complaint comes after another one filed by Hermoso earlier this week, which enabled prosecutors to launch a preliminary investigation into possible charges of sexual assault.
The prosecutor's office said that Hermoso referred during her testimony to pressure she had suffered, alongside her family, at the hands of Rubiales and his ""professional entourage"" to say that she ""justified and approved what happened."" This prompted the prosecution to add the possible coercion accusation.
Rubiales held Hermoso's head with both hands and kissed her on the lips during the medal ceremony that followed Spain's 1-0 win over England in the final of the Women's World Cup in Australia on August 20.
Hermoso later said the kiss had left her feeling ""vulnerable and like the victim of an assault,"" with a statement on social media describing it as ""an impulsive, macho act, out of place and with no type of consent on my part.""
Rubiales, who has so far refused to resign despite heavy pressure, said the kiss was ""spontaneous, mutual, euphoric and consensual.""

World football governing body FIFA suspended the 46-year-old Rubiales from his post on August 27 for 90 days, pending an investigation.
A Spanish government legal panel overseeing sports has also opened a probe to determine if he abused his authority by kissing Hermoso.

https://www.dw.com/en/south-sudan-has-qualified-for-the-olympics-what-next/a-66756264,SPORTS,"South Sudan has qualified for the Olympics, what next? 08.09.2023","Up until last week, the biggest sporting achievement of South Sudan was qualifying for the FIBA Basketball World Cup.
That was no mean feat for the world's youngest country. Years of investment by former NBA star Luol Deng has seen the national basketball team reach the pinnacle of the sport with a core of players recruited from the South Sudanese diaspora, many of whose parents were displaced by the war of independence from Sudan and the civil war that emerged after South Sudan became independent in 2011.
The team topped that achievement by booking a ticket to the Olympic Games at the FIBA World Cup, causing celebrations in the streets of the capital Juba, and surrounding towns and villages.
Their 101-78 victory over African powerhouse Angola handed them the automatic African ticket for Paris 2024. The fans watching inside the Nimra Talata Basketball Stadium danced and waved the national flag in celebration.
""I am so happy that it is happening,"" Deng told DW at a welcome reception in Juba on Wednesday, where the team was feted for its impressive performance. ""We play for more than the game. That's because of the love that we get and what it does to everyone.""
Deng, who moved to the United Kingdom with his family as a young refugee and represented the UK at the 2012 Olympics, was once an All-Star in the NBA with the Chicago Bulls. But even he says that the accolades that the Bright Stars have received are unique: ""I played in the NBA, but I was never loved like that."" 
Blessed with the height and love of the game — Manute Bol and Ring Ayuel being two of the most famous big men from the country — Deng saw the opportunity the sport could offer for national growth and rejuvenation as he gathered players from the diaspora to represent their homeland.
South Sudan played their first official international game only six years ago. In 2021, they qualified for their first continental competition, the Afrobasket, and finished seventh of 16 teams.
The Bright Stars fought through a stacked African qualification field and made it to their first World Cup this year. However, as the team prepared for the tournament, allegations of corruption dogged the sports ministry, which was accused of mis-spending funds meant for transporting fans to support the team. But in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, the team won three matches, including against China and the hosts, to finish as Africa's best team.
""We have gone from not being recognized in the world to using basketball to change the belief of so many people about our country,"" said Deng. ""I'm not saying that everything is 100% sweet; there are a lot of holes that still need to be filled, and we recognize that.""
The 28-year-old forward Nuni Omot, who was born in a Kenyan refugee camp after his parents fled the Second Sudanese Civil War before settling in the United States, described the unbelievable experience. ""I'm just very blessed and honored to be able to do this with my brothers. There's no other feeling like being able to bring positivity to the country,"" he told DW.
""The media portrays South Sudan as a bad place, but for us to lift the flag and show the positivity, obviously for the next generation and generations to come, is historic and something that can't be taken away from us.""
South Sudan has just four outdoor basketball courts, with 11 more currently under construction. It is the only country, which does not have an indoor court at all, to have played at the World Cup. The civil war took its toll on sports and cultural activities, but the South Sudan flag will now fly high at the next Olympics.
Much work still needs to be done to create a sustainable basketball program in South Sudan, said Busara Rajab, a South Sudanese basketball expert who has coached several teams and players for 16 years. He hopes schools can be the pathway to growing the sport: ""Any sport needs big support. If you want a player to train for six hours a day, you cannot find it here in Juba because we don't have many basics to help us,"" he told DW.
The national team's captain, Kuany Ngor Kuany, 29, who was raised in Australia, where his parents fled to when he was nine, said that proper facilities would help players. ""Hopefully, soon, we will see the infrastructure that the federation built (across) the 10 states,"" he said. 
""But to get to that level where we have homegrown talent, we need a lot more infrastructure and indoor basketball courts for us to be able to compete at the elite level.""
Deputy Secretary General of the South Sudan Basketball Federation Arou Ramadan Chan said there were plans to ensure the game grew at home. ""We will continue pushing for that because we know that the same crop of players playing for our national team has the same DNA with those kids in Rumbek, in Torit and Bahr el Ghazal,"" Chan said.
As Deng and his young team continue to enjoy their celebrations, they are already creating more progress than South Sudan's politicians have achieved for the country.

Coco Gauff's US open semifinal victory over Karolina Muchova was delayed by 50 minutes when four climate activists wearing t-shirts saying ""end fossil fuels"" began sloganeering.
One of the protesters glued his bare feet to the concrete floor. The Extinction Rebellion (XR) group said it was behind the protest.
The US Tennis Association (USTA) said three of the protesters were immediately escorted out of the stadium but it took time to remove the fourth person whose feet were stuck to the ground.

""Due to the nature of this action, NYPD (New York Police Department) and medical personnel were needed in order to safely remove this individual from the stadium,"" said the USTA in a statement.
Spectators were moved away from the scene. Gauff and Muchova, who initially waited on the court, eventually left for their locker rooms.
USTA added that all four protesters had been taken into police custody.
The Extinction Rebellion said in a statement on Thursday that the protest was designed to draw attention to the ""greatest emergency of our time.""
Shayok Mukhopadhyay, an XR activist, said that while the group was not protesting the event itself, they had to use the US Open event as a ""last resort"" to ""draw public attention to the climate emergency we are facing today.""
One of the protesters who identified himself as Ian said the US Open has sponsorship deals with corporations whose policies are contributing to climate change.
The US Open has become the latest high-profile sporting event to be targeted by climate protesters.
Last month at a US Open tune-up tournament, a dozen people were asked to leave the site after they chanted and displayed signs protesting the use of fossil fuels.
At Wimbledon in July, two matches were halted when environmental activists jumped out of the stands and scattered orange confetti on the grass.
In June, two men from the ""Just Stop Oil"" movement disrupted The Ashes cricket test match in England and scattered orange powder on the field.
Similar disruptions have taken place during the World Snooker Championship, the English Premiership rugby final and Formula One racing events.

https://www.dw.com/en/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-invictus-games-in-dusseldorf/a-66747427,SPORTS,What you need to know about the Invictus Games in Dusseldorf 07.09.2023,"The Invictus Games are a Paralympic sporting event for soldiers who have suffered physical or psychological wounds while serving their countries in war zones. ""Invictus"" is the Latin word for undefeated or unconquered.
Initiated by Prince Harry, the inaugural Invictus Games were held in London in 2014, two years after the British capital had hosted the Summer Olympics. Speaking at the launch, Harry, who served as a co-pilot and gunner on an Apache helicopter in Afghanistan, said the aim was to ""demonstrate the importance of sport in recovery, support rehabilitation and showcase life beyond disability."" He was inspired to launch Invictus while attending the US Warrior Games in 2013, when wounded British forces had been invited to take part for the first time.
The sixth edition of the Invictus Games are being jointly hosted by the western German city of Dusseldorf and the Bundeswehr, Germany's armed forces. The motto of this year's Games is ""A home for respect,"" and the organizers are hoping to attract around 100,000 spectators to the week-long event, which runs from September 9 to 16.
Organizers are expecting around 550 athletes from 21 nations to compete in Dusseldorf. That's about 50 more athletes and three more countries than took part at the last games in The Hague last year. Teams from Israel and Colombia are taking part for the first time, while war-torn Ukraine was to send 24 athletes to Dusseldorf. Ukraine are now a fixture at the Invictus Games, having made their debut in Toronto in 2017.
Competition starts on Day 2 (Sunday, September 10). The sports featured are archery, athletics, indoor rowing, bench press, sitting volleyball, cycling, swimming, wheelchair rugby and wheelchair basketball. Making its Invictus debut in Dusseldorf will be table tennis.
No. According to the Invictus Games Foundation, they also provide support to wounded and sick military personnel though their digital ""We are Invictus"" platform and a peer-to-peer network. They aim to support wounded soldiers' recovery though ""sports, esports, adventurous challenge, employment, volunteering, speaking opportunities and more."" Grants are also available through its ""Invictus: Endeavors program.
Yes.  A group of anti-war activists are planning to demonstrate against the Dusseldorf event – at the same time as Prince Harry and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorious are to attend a ceremony at city hall. While stressing that their demonstration will not be directed against the athletes taking part, the protest organizers accuse the Bundeswehr of using the event as a venue for drumming up new recruits. Invictus organizers deny this. The activists also object to Boeing as a sponsor, as it is one of the world's top arms manufacturers.

https://www.dw.com/en/spain-jorge-vildas-sacking-a-just-outcome/a-66740598,SOCCER,Spain: Jorge Vilda's sacking a 'just' outcome 07.09.2023,"A little over two weeks after winning the World Cup, head coach Jorge Vilda was fired by the acting president of the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), Pedro Rocha.
The much-maligned Vilda was bullish in the immediate aftermath of his sacking, calling his dismissal ""unfair.""
While much of the focus has been centered around suspended RFEF president Luis Rubiales, following his unsolicited kiss of striker Jennifer Hermoso as she collected her winner's medal, the first permanent axe has fallen on the man who coached the Spanish women's team to a historic first world title.
But, it is the least surprising outcome thus far, and freelance Spanish journalist Esther Olmeda believes it will be a relief for 81 players who refused to be called up to the national team while Rubiales remained in charge, and systematic changes within the entire organization were made.
""They may have won the World Cup, but they were playing for each other and never for Vilda,"" Olmeda told DW.
""The players who were part of the squad agreed to be professional and put aside their feelings for the coach. At the time, they felt they had no other option. This is a small piece of justice.""
One of the most uncomfortable truths of Spain lifting the World Cup was a resigned acknowledgment that it almost certainly meant Vilda would remain as head coach for an extended period. 
""Of course, there was happiness when they created history just by reaching the semifinal,"" Olmeda added. ""But for some of us who have followed the team for so long and know how much they have suffered, the feeling was also of knowing change would not be possible.""
The unlikeliest of World Cup victories came despite La Roja having been without at least 12 of the country's best players after they had emailed the RFEF in September 2022 regarding the detrimental conditions they were enduring under Vilda.
Instead of seeking a conversation with the players, which included Barcelona trio Mariona Caldenty, Mapi Leon and Sandra Panos, the RFEF, led at the time by Rubiales, publicly rebuked the players and put their full support behind Vilda.
It was a reaction that shocked the players, who were forced to attempt to fight their battle in public and remained adamant that they were not seeking Vilda's dismissal but simply an improvement in standards.
The 42-year-old was said to have ruled with an iron fist, allegedly forcing players to leave hotel room doors open at night so he could verify they were. He is also accused of checking their bags' contents when they left the team hotel.
Leon remained steadfast and outspoken in her beliefs, saying in an interview with Mundo Deportivo in March: ""It's one thing if we've only been demanding this [higher standards for the national team] for a week, but when it's been years … I don't want to compare, but I'm at Barcelona, and I'm very happy with the level there.""
Following a friendly against China in April, when asked by DW about the state of his squad with 15 of his most senior players, Vilda made a clear statement on his belief of their actions.
""We only want hope, cohesion, desire, motivation to be in the national team and above all pride. Pride to be part of the team, pride in putting on the training kit every time you come out onto the pitch,"" he said.
When the World Cup finally began 10 months after the first complaints surfaced, three of the 15 striking Spanish internationals returned to the fold — Caldentey, Ona Battle and eventual player of the tournament, Aitana Bonmati.
While local Spanish media asked only football-related questions at the pre- and postgame press conferences with Vilda, foreign journalists pushed the head coach on the 12 players who remained in Spain.
The response from the head coach was blunt and repetitive, saying he only focused on the 23 players in the squad until La Roja defeated Sweden 2-1 to book their place in the World Cup final.
Vilda used the historic achievement to thank Rubiales for his ""support and commitment."" The victory seemingly gave the former RFEF sporting director the platform to be more honest about his feelings.
""The support of Luis Rubiales, the president of the federation, and everyone at the federation means so much and will always stay with me, as well as that of my family because they have suffered this year,"" he said after the World Cup win.
""At the end of the day, it has been a learning process, and I think it has made all of us stronger. Now we can file it away and put it behind us and think about the future and think that we deserve to be where we are.""
Although he did not use the moment to speak about the players, many of them repeatedly used the mixed zone after every match during the tournament that the team was ""suffering"" but accepted it as they sought ultimate victory.
Captain Olga Carmona, named player of the final after scoring the winning goal, reiterated the sentiment afterward.
""Of course, we have suffered, but now it is worth it. This is the only way it could have been,"" she said.
The context of that suffering is all the more evident now in the wake of Rubiales' kiss of Hermoso, which the 81 national players said was a sign of the challenging environment they have had to deal with for many years.
""The players have always deserved better, but there were too many working against them,"" journalist Olmeda explained. ""This is a first step towards hope, but it cannot be the last.""

https://www.dw.com/en/brazil-lula-adds-bolsonaro-supporters-to-cabinet/a-66741324,POLITICS,Brazil: Lula adds Bolsonaro supporters to Cabinet 07.09.2023,"Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Wednesday announced a Cabinet reshuffle that will bring into his government two ministers who were once allied with his political rival and predecessor Jair Bolsonaro.
Andre Fufuca was named as the sports minister and Silvio Costa Filho will be the new ports and airports minister, said the Lula government in a statement.
Both the lawmakers used to hold key positions in the far-right Bolsonaro administration, which governed from 2019 to 2022.

The move is being seen as a tactic to shore up support for Lula's political agenda from a powerful bloc of lawmakers.
The president also created a new portfolio for small- and medium-sized enterprises that increased the number of ministries from 37 to 38.
The latest announcement also seals the entry into Cabinet of the party of lower house speaker Arthur Lira, who was a supporter of Bolsonaro.
The reshuffle was preceded by a series of negotiations between the government and Centrao, a group of center-right parties characterized by their support for whichever party rules the Congress. The bloc is known more for its horse-trading prowess than ideological commitments.

A presidential official told the media that the reshuffle was important because ""We needed our legislative agenda to advance. We could not continue as we were.""
Lula is on his third term as president and now seeks support in Congress to approve the budget for 2024 and a tax reform.
The new ministers will take oath once ""President Lula returns from the G20 meeting,"" in India, the Brazilian government said in a statement.

https://www.dw.com/en/spain-hermoso-files-criminal-complaint-over-rubiales-kiss/a-66737277,LAW AND JUSTICE,Spain: Hermoso files criminal complaint over Rubiales kiss 06.09.2023,"Spain's football star Jenni Hermoso filed a criminal complaint over the unsolicited kiss by federation boss Luis Rubiales after Spain won the Women's World Cup, prosecutors said on Wednesday.
The complaint, which was filed on Tuesday, enables prosecutors to launch a preliminary investigation on possible charges of sexual assault. The complaint will be processed ""as soon as possible"", the prosecutor added.
The lawsuit could entail criminal charges against Rubiales, in addition to ongoing investigations by Spain's top sports court into ""serious misconduct"" and an investigation by world football's governing body FIFA, which has provisionally suspended Rubiales.

Rubiales grabbed Hermoso's head and kissed her on the lips during the medal ceremony that followed Spain's 1-0 win over England in the final of the Women's World Cup in Australia on August 20.
Hermoso later said the unwanted kiss had left her feeling ""vulnerable and like the victim of an assault,"" with a statement on social media describing it as ""an impulsive, macho act, out of place and with no type of consent on my part."" 
Rubiales, who has so far refused to resign despite heavy pressure, said the kiss was ""spontaneous, mutual, euphoric and consensual.""
Late last month, the prosecutor for Spain's High Court said Rubiales could face a sexual assault charge, which can carry a prison term of between one and four years, if Hermoso were to file a complaint.
Hermoso now plays for Mexican club Pachuca after a long career with top Spanish and European clubs, including Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid.

https://www.dw.com/en/scholz-criticizes-german-bureaucracy-risk-aversion/a-66732373,POLITICS,"Scholz criticizes German bureaucracy, risk aversion 06.09.2023","German Chancellor Olaf Scholz appealed to the country's democratic parties to unite in a concerted effort to modernize Germany, speed up bureaucracy and combat the current economic crisis.
Defending his government's proposed budget in front of lawmakers on Wednesday, Scholz announced what he dubbed a ""Germany pact"" for the good of the country.
He called on the opposition, local officials and state agencies to back his government's measures to kick-start the German economy — and also fend off the threat from the far right, which recent polls have shown is rising in popularity.
""The citizens are fed up with this standstill, and I am too,"" said Scholz, criticizing a ""mildew of red tape, risk averseness and despondency"" that he said has weighed down Europe's largest economy in recent years.
Scholz's government budget plans for 2024 foresee streamlined approval processes for infrastructure and construction projects and further digitalization of Germany's notoriously analog bureaucracy.
""We need a new national effort"" to make Germany ""faster, more modern and more secure,"" said Scholz, sporting a black eyepatch over one eye following a jogging accident and calling for: ""Speed, not standing still; action, not hesitation; cooperation, not arguments.""
According to Scholz, the ""Germany pact"" is not only necessary to reinvigorate Germany's ailing economy and modernize the state but also to fend off the growing threat posed by the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD).
""The vast majority of citizens know that the self-proclaimed 'alternative' is in fact a demolition squad — a demolition squad for our country,"" he said, accusing the AfD, whose popularity hit 21% in recent polls, of aiming to benefit from the economic downturn.
Acknowledging that his three-party coalition government, which includes his own center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the business-focused Free Democrats, has ""argued too much in recent weeks,"" he called on Germany's democratic forces to ""counter those who want to make political profit from scaremongering or scenarios of decline.""
According to the draft budget for 2024, introduced by Finance Minister Christian Lindner (FDP) on Tuesday, the federal government intends to spend €445.7 billion ($477.9 billion) next year, some €30 billion less than this year.
The government intends to offer record sums for investments, including €58 billion in climate-friendly mobility, the hydrogen economy and digitalization and €54 billion in new transport infrastructure, railways and bridges, including an extra €24 billion of investment for state railway company Deutsche Bahn over the next four years.
""This is the biggest program of investment in such a short period since the steam train,"" claimed Scholz.
Responding to criticism that countries such as the United States offers much greater subsidies to companies in IT chips and battery sector, Scholz insisted that, ""in proportion to the size of Germany and our economy, these investments absolutely match up to the USA.""
Further criticism, led by opposition leader Friedrich Merz of the center-right conservative Christian Democrats, accused the coalition government of failing to meet the demands of the ""Zeitenwende,"" the large-scale ""turning point"" that Scholz famously announced in the immediate aftermath of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
In particular, Merz attacked the funding of Germany's armed forces, accusing the government of dipping into the €100 billion one-off special fund allocated to the Bundeswehr to meet NATO demands for 2% of state spending to go on defense.
""What we're seeing instead is an effectively unchanged state of affairs in defense,"" said Merz. ""And the losers are our soldiers.""
Scholz hit back, guaranteeing that NATO demands would continue to be met in 2028, 2029 and into the 2030s, even after the one-off special fund has been exhausted.

https://www.dw.com/en/spanish-football-fires-womens-coach-jorge-vilda/a-66729123,SOCCER,Spanish football fires women's coach Jorge Vilda 05.09.2023,"The  Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) on Tuesday fired women's national team coach Jorge Vilda, just over two weeks after his team won the Women's World Cup.
Villa's departure comes after the FIFA and later the RFEF suspended federation president Luis Rubiales over his kiss on the lips of player Jenni Hermoso in celebrations after Spain's victory in the final.
The scandal that surrounded Rubiales' behavior triggered a national and worldwide debate over women's rights and sexist behavior.
Soon after, it appointed the first ever woman to the role, naming Montse Tome, assistant coach since 2018, to the top job with the women's national team. 
A statement from the RFEF thanked 42-year-old Vilda for his ""extraordinary sporting legacy"" without mentioning the scandal surrounding Rubiales' impromptu kiss and the subsequent meltdown.
""The coach has been key to the remarkable growth of women's football and leaves Spain as world champions and second in the FIFA rankings,"" the RFEF statement said.
Considered a close ally of Rubiales, Vilda was among those who applauded Rubiales when he refused to stand down amid widespread criticism for kissing Hermoso on the lips without consent after the Sydney final against England.
He gripped Hermoso's head with both hands as he did so in an action that the player has described as unwanted and sexist.
Rubiales also sparked outrage for clutching his crotch in a lewd victory gesture.

The women's squad, plus other players, said they would not play for Spain while the chief remained in post.
Vilda later issued a statement condemning the actions of Rubiales, but many considered it too little, too late.
The federation's announcement about Vilda came immediately after the body sent its ""most sincere apologies"" for the ""totally unacceptable behavior"" of Rubiales, who FIFA suspended for 90 days.
The federation pledged immediate action to improve its governance and ""to repair, as far as possible, the damage caused.""
""The damage caused to Spanish football, to Spanish sport, to Spanish society and the values of football and sport as a whole have been enormous,"" the three-page statement signed by interim RFEF President Pedro Rocha said.
At first, the RFEF had staunchly defended Rubiales and threatened legal action. It's still possible, though it appears increasingly unlikely, that the suspended president return to his post.
Vilda had already been a figure of controversy after 15 players last year staged a mutiny calling for him to quit or be forced out. They had cited inadequate coaching methods and called for conditions to match those of the men's squad.
The footballers also complained of Vilda being too strict and micromanaging them — to the point of telling senior players what they should say in media interviews.
While some of the demands were met, most of the players involved were cut from the squad and Vilda received strong backing from Rubiales.
Rubiales eventually found himself with a diminishing number of supporters, although his mother did stage a brief hunger strike in a church in southern Spain, denouncing what she perceived as injustice against her son.
The coach of Spain's men's national football team, Luis de la Fuente had also applauded Rubiales' refusal to quit and his tirade against ""false feminists.""
De la Fuente apologized on Friday for having clapped, describing it as an ""inexcusable human error.""
The Spanish men's team on Monday joined in the criticism of Rubiales' actions.
""We want to reject what we consider to be unacceptable behavior from Mr. Rubiales, who has not lived up to the institution he represents,"" captain Alvaro Morata said in a  statement on behalf of the team.

https://www.dw.com/en/bayern-munich-and-rwanda-sponsorship-causes-criticism/a-66724712,SOCCER,Bayern Munich and Rwanda: Sponsorship causes criticism 05.09.2023,"There are almost 6,000 kilometers (3,728 miles) between Munich and the Rwandan capital Kigali. They are different worlds in many respects, but a new sponsorship deal should bring them closer together.
The state tourism campaign Visit Rwanda wants to attract more tourists to the East African country by advertising with Bayern Munich, as it has done before with Arsenal FC and Paris Saint-Germain. How many millions will flow from Africa to Germany for this purpose by 2028 is unknown. However, the premium partnerships tend to cost in the ballpark of €5 million ($5.3 million) per year.
Jan-Christian Dreesen, Bayern's CEO, defended the partnership at the European Club Association (ECA) meeting in Berlin on September 7. 
""Yes, we take money from Rwanda, but we also do something for it; by being open about it, by sending coaches there, by building a youth academy together, and so on,"" he told DW. ""We want to be part of the development of Rwanda and also champion Africa as a continent of opportunity.""
However, human rights campaigners see it rather differently.
""A very, very bad choice,"" said Wenzel Michalski of the NGO Human Rights Watch, referring to the human rights situation in Rwanda. Critics, including journalists, are threatened and silenced, he said. Furthermore, there have been reports of arbitrary abductions, torture and unexplained deaths.
The politically active Munich fan scene, in which Christian Nandelstädt is well connected as a club member and blogger, have been similarly shocked by the German record champion's new deal. ""We reject this,"" he told DW in no uncertain terms. 
In Kigali, opinions differ about the multi-million dollar image-building campaign. The accusation is that the regime of ruler Paul Kagame is engaged in sportswashing and wants to use the campaign to divert attention from the abuses of freedom of the press, democracy and the fight against poverty.
For journalist Gonza Mugangwa, former secretary general of the Rwandan Journalists' Association, this aspect is obvious but not at all decisive. ""What really worries most Rwandans is whether it's worth investing these sums,"" he told DW.
Of course, people are proud when their country is so prominently represented, he said. However, he is skeptical whether the income from these deals also helps the average citizen to improve their financial situation.
""That would be the case if income came from tourism and could be directly linked to these sponsorships,"" he said. In practice, however, this is difficult, which is why he ""does not yet see any dividends in direct sponsorship relationships with the clubs.""
Bayern fan Charles Ndushabandi from Kigali, on the other hand, tells DW he is optimistic: ""I'm sure that Rwanda as a brand has gained more recognition since these contracts were signed. Not only in Africa, but also in Europe and Latin America because these football clubs are big and watched by millions.""
Many in the Bayern fan scene aren't impressed by the decision. After the end of the much-criticized partnership with Qatar Airways, there had been ""a few weeks of bliss,"" Christian Nandelstädt said, ""and now this!"" Once again, he said, business is being done with an autocratic state, once again a contract has been signed for five years.
""It's hard to understand why. The club is swimming in money,"" he said. According to him, protests in the Munich Südkurve [where the most loyal fans gather to watch the games - the ed.] are to be expected again. He's dismissive of the argument of promoting talent used by the club to justify its commitment. ""For that, they would have had to get involved in another, more democratic country in Africa.""
It is probably no coincidence that Rwanda, of all places, is now being considered in Munich. President Kagame maintains close contacts with Qatar, right into the circles of the ruling house. Moreover, Qatar Airways, the former sponsor of Bayern, is one of the biggest players in the African country. The Qatari airline holds almost half of the shares in the state-owned airline RwandAir and has a 60% stake in Bugesera International Airport, which is currently under construction.
Talking to foreign observers in Kigali, it also becomes clear who is most likely to reap the rewards from the international money flows and the fairly high rates for tourists. The economy is largely in the hands of the ruling party, the RPF. Moreover, the much-vaunted economic upswing is concentrated only in the capital. Clean streets, glittering glass facades and other amenities, such as a golf course designed by PGA legend Gary Player, await visitors there.
In less urban areas though, poverty still reigns, while floods in May exacerbated the hardship. The millions that are now flowing into the Bundesliga could also be put to good use here.
The road to the top European leagues is long, even for youngsters who go through the extremely performance-oriented system of youth academies in France or Germany. In this respect, the new deal does not tear down any walls.
At best, it slightly opens the door for Rwandan football talent.
That's echoed by sports journalist Jah d'Eau Dukuze, who produces one of the leading sports programs in Rwanda.
""The sponsorships already have an effect. For example, the cooperation with PSG was important for the development of young players who would like to become professionals."" Young footballers between the ages of 12 and 15 have been to France twice to compete with their peers, he told DW. ""It's a rare opportunity.""
Creating such opportunities — away from the million-dollar deals — is now Bayern Munich's job.

https://www.dw.com/en/spain-world-cup-win-and-rubiales-kiss-may-reshape-football/a-66723976,SOCCER,Spain: World Cup win and Rubiales' kiss may reshape football 05.09.2023,"Two weeks on from Spain's triumph over England in the women's World Cup, young players training in the fading heat of a late Friday afternoon at CCF Olympia Las Rozas — a team located just north-west of Madrid — are evidently still basking in the afterglow.
""It means a lot for us as football players, because now the world puts us on the map,"" 23-year-old midfielder Lucia Fernandez told DW. ""It's very important for us and for the little girls coming through, because now they have a reference, which is something that we didn't have in our time.""
Moreover, as her teammate 18-year-old Marta Buendia explained to DW during warm-ups, something about this World Cup just felt different. ""There was much more support around,"" Buendia said. ""Usually only the Americans watch (women's) soccer.""

Buendia is right as proven by the record-smashing TV viewing figures. In Spain, close to 6 million watched the final, while in England more than 12 million tuned in at peak audience time. Match ticket sales in traditionally football-ambivalent host nation Australia also massively outstripped the target of 1.5 million, to the delight of FIFA.
In fact, a report published last month by the world football governing body hailed improving professional opportunities and commercial prospects as well as a huge increase in the number of women and girls playing organized football: almost 25% since 2019, reaching 16.6 million worldwide.
The historic win should be good news for the women's game in Spain, translating into more interest and more financial support, CCF Olympia Las Rozas sports director Ana de la Chica said.
""What we have shown with what we have achieved here is that if you invest in women's sport, you always get good results,"" the 38-year-old said.
In short, it's a good moment for women's football in Spain. Except for the elephant in the room.
There is one topic no one at CCF Olympia Las Rozas wants to discuss: Luis Rubiales, the disgraced president of the Spanish football association (RFEF) and the kiss he foisted on player Jenni Hermoso during the award ceremony. She quickly made clear it was not consensual, but Rubiales maintains that it was and has flat out refused to resign.
Facing investigation into whether the incident amounts to sexual assault and suspended by FIFA, the 46-year-old's position is looking increasingly untenable. Initially, the Spanish FA rallied around him, accusing Hermoso of lying and threatening to sue her. Last Monday, the same organization called for Rubiales' resignation, saying he had ""seriously damaged the image of Spanish football.""
With a huge social media backlash, condemnations from prominent footballers and dozens of street protests staged, Nadia Tronchoni, sports editor-in-chief at Spain's El Pais newspaper, believes it is only a matter of time before Rubiales is stripped of his power for the long term.
He still has some defenders, Tronchoni told DW, many of them in the male-dominated Spanish football association. Not to mention his mother, Angeles Bejar, who announced a hunger strike to support him last week.
For the World Cup winning team, problems go much deeper than one man's behavior at the World Cup final. They are about structural inequalities and a fractured relationship with now former head coach Jorge Vilda, who was let go on Tuesday.
For years now, many of Spain's top women players have called for more respect, money and staff to be committed to their game. They say they want greater professionalism from the RFEF and salaries that reflect their status as athletes.
Late last year, 15 players indicated they would not represent the country unless there was change, saying the situation was taking a toll on their health and emotional state. The RFEF under Rubiales sided resolutely with Vilda and condemned the players for ""scheming"" in an incendiary statement that raised the prospect of legal action.
Despite the fiery reaction, some positive changes were made, according to Tronchoni. Ultimately three of those 15 players — including Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati — decided to play at the World Cup.
Given the simmering conflict, the RFEF president and former head coach's swaggering behavior is even more jarring, she said. ""They made a big exhibition of winning this World Cup."" 
Rubiales was also seen grabbing his crotch just meters away from Queen Letizia and her teenage daughter during the final. For Tronchoni, the message from the two men appeared to be: ""It's because we did it, us men too. We warned these girls, we stayed on our feet, and we did what we wanted. And now we won.""
Rubiales views himself as the victim of a manhunt. During his speech to the RFEF — where according to Tronchoni only 6 of the 140 people in attendance were women — he blasted ""fake feminism, a great scourge in our country.""
His actions have touched a nerve well beyond the world of football. On Friday evening, protesters gathered in several Spanish cities, including Madrid, organized by a left-wing student group. Demonstrators at the capital's Puerta del Sol plaza held up signs reading ""down with rape culture"" and ""resign!""
""We're basically calling him out, telling him 'please go', because right now what everyone's talking about is not the great triumph for the champions of women's football. They're talking about this man,"" a 25-year-old named Isabel told DW.
The widespread condemnation, which even sawfar-right party VOX slam his behavior, although also decrying a left-wing ""political and media hunt"" against him, can be read as a sign of change.
""The best thing that this unwanted kiss has done was show us that society has understood feminist culture,"" Tronchoni said. The backlash against Rubiales was natural and quick, according to the sports journalist. ""The country is a lot more feminist than it was five years ago.""
The question is whether this will also change the women's game. After Rubiales' speech, when he stressed five times that he would not resign, more than 80 of Spain's best women players, including all 23 World Cup winners, announced a strike on representing the nation. And last week, unions representing athletes playing in Spain's top flight, La Liga, announced they could also strike over pay when the season starts this month.
What is different now is that the RFEF can no longer simply dismiss the demands made by the women's team, Tronchoni claimed. ""We're going to believe them when they say we need to change, when they say this is not professionalism, when they say we need to be respected. This is not acceptable.""
CCF Olympia las Rozas sports manager de la Chica has witnessed her own team blossom since it was set up in 2015. ""We started with 13 girls and now we have more than 350. And after the World Cup win, the telephone has been ringing and we have even more.""
""What we are looking for now is the visibility that gets us opportunities and that allows girls to develop in a safe environment with the best possible tools.""

https://www.dw.com/en/bundesliga-victor-boniface-leading-leverkusens-early-title-challenge/a-66717714,SOCCER,Bundesliga: Victor Boniface leading Leverkusen's early title challenge 05.09.2023,"Victor Boniface's brace in Bayer Leverkusen's win against Darmstadt on Saturday was impressive, but they weren't his first competitive goals at the BayArena.
Five months ago, he found the same net when he fired Belgian side Union Saint-Gilloise into the lead in the Europa League quarterfinal first leg. Leverkusen ultimately progressed 5-2 on aggregate, but Boniface had left his mark on the Werkself.
""He's a proper tanker, the weights room must be his best friend,"" commented Leverkusen midfielder Robert Andrich at the time. ""He repeatedly made good runs behind our lines, and his finish wasn't bad either. He's really horrible to play against. I don't know if he does that every week.""
Not every week, but regularly enough, with his 22 goals and 12 assists in all competitions for Saint-Gilloise convincing Leverkusen to pay €16m ($17.3m) for the young Nigerian, a fee which could yet rise as high as €20.5m with bonus payments, despite an injury record which already lists two cruciate ligament tears in the same knee.
""It was a business decision as to whether or not we should take that risk,"" explained sporting director Simon Rolfes after offering Boniface a five-year contract when others, including Bundesliga rivals RB Leipzig had decided not to. ""But, in our opinion, it was worth it.""
And he's been proven right so far as the 22-year-old has spearheaded Leverkusen's perfect start to the season, with four goals and two assists in the first three league games showcasing that he's an all-round powerhouse. Furthermore, he's struck up an immediate understanding with rising star Florian Wirtz, as well as fellow summer signings Granit Xhaka and Jonas Hofmann.
""He has everything,"" former Belgian national team coach Marc Wilmots, who watched Boniface closely in Belgium's Jupiler Pro League last season, told Kicker magazine. ""He's strong on the ball and fast, a real weapon. He fits into any system, either as part of a front two or as a lone striker.""
So far in Germany, it's been the latter. But come October, when Czech striker Patrik Schick is expected to return after undergoing surgery for a long-term groin injury, head coach Xabi Alonso will have even more options.
""Of course, everyone's talking about his goals, but Victor is also important in our build-up play with his presence and ability to hold the ball up,"" said Rolfes after the win over newly promoted Darmstadt. ""When the opposition press, it helps the central defenders to know they have someone who they can play to. That's just as important as his goals.""
Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky, happy now to only be facing Boniface in training, summed it up, saying: ""He's a nightmare for any defense.""
Boniface's versatility suits Bayer Leverkusen well this season, with the Werkself looking a much more rounded team under Alonso having reinvested the €55m received from Aston Villa for Moussa Diaby wisely in Boniface, Xhaka and Hofmann.
The question now is whether Alonso, in his second season in charge, can build on Leverkusen's shrewd signings and perfect start and mount a serious challenge for the title — or indeed any trophy.
Despite exemption from the 50+1 rule and financial backing from pharmaceutical giants Bayer, Leverkusen have only ever won two major trophies in their entire history: the UEFA Cup in 1988 and the German Cup in 1993. Since then, a series of near misses have seen them acquire the disparaging nicknames of ""Vizekusen"" — a play on the German word for ""vice"" — or the anglicized ""Neverkusen.""
In 2002, they famously lost in the finals of both the German Cup and Champions League while throwing away the league title on the final day. In 2020, they were seconds away from going into the winter break top of the league before conceding a last-minute goal against Bayern Munich. And last season, they were ultimately knocked out of the Europa League in the semifinal by Roma.
When the Bundesliga returns from the international break, a trip to Munich will offer a clearer barometer of just how good this Leverkusen side is.
""We're not going to go to Munich and defend for 90 minutes,"" promised midfielder Xhaka after the win over Darmstadt. ""We respect Bayern, but we're not scared. We want points, and we want to see where we really stand.""

Rubiales forcibly kissed Hermoso on the lips after Spain won the Women's World Cup two weeks ago.
He has faced growing pressure to step down as head of the Spanish football federation ever since.
Spain's men's team rejected Rubiales' behavior, saying he had not lived up to the institution he represents.
They also expressed solidarity with the women players and ""deplored that their success had been tarnished.""
Rubiales has refused to step down, saying the kiss was consensual. But Hermoso says she did not consent.
The world soccer governing body FIFA has already suspended Rubiales pending an investigation.
Spain's sports court has also opened a case against Rubiales for ""serious misconduct.""

https://www.dw.com/en/manipur-violence-threatens-status-of-womens-football/a-66713001,SOCCER,Manipur violence threatens status of women's football 04.09.2023,"Warning: This article contains descriptions of sexual violence
Manipur has long been famous in India as a sporting powerhouse and the driving force behind women's football on the subcontinent. However, in recent months, the northeastern state bordering Myanmar has made international headlines for different reasons.
Ethnic tensions spilled over into violence in May, when the Kuki tribal group, who reside mainly on the hills, clashed with the majority Meiteis, primarily residents of the Imphal Valley, on the question of land resources and political representation. Around 160 people were killed, and it was estimated that between 40,000 to 60,000 had been forced to flee their homes.
The situation in the state that is home to three million people subsequently quietened, but violence flared again on August 29. According to local reports, 18 people were killed in these latest clashes between the Kukis and Meiteis. 
There are concerns that Manipur's status as a sporting powerhouse, especially for women's football, could be negatively affected in the long term.
With a strong female sporting culture, Manipur's women won the National Women's Football Championship in June for the 21st time out of 26 editions and have consistently kept the national team supplied with talent.  
""Football is the number one sport in Manipur, and men and women have been equal across sports. Physical fitness among women is encouraged, and they match the men,"" Ngangom Bala Devi, a Manipur native and star forward of the India Women's team who recently left Scottish club Rangers, told DW. ""This is now spreading elsewhere in India but has traditionally been true in Manipur in a number of sports and not just football.""
Manipur resident and local news editor Debanish Achom also highlighted the state's traditionally egalitarian culture and its natural sporting advantage.
""Everyone, men or women, takes up some sports, and football happens to be one of them,"" Achom said. ""And since Manipur women are relatively empowered to go out and be independent, they get the time and confidence to play. Manipur's weather is also favorable for football, as it's colder than mainland India, where the summer temperature is very high.""

The egalitarian culture did not match the image broadcast worldwide in July when a video surfaced of two naked Kuki women publicly paraded by a group of Meitei men. It has been alleged that the women were gang-raped. India Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the incident had shamed the country and promised those guilty would face justice.
""This video was shared widely on social media, which sparked outrage across India,"" said Achom. ""These visuals of the ethnic clashes in Manipur have contributed to the deteriorating image of the state as a place that is unsafe for women.""
It also makes it harder for girls and women to play football, especially as whole areas of the country are shut down while security forces seek to take control of the situation.
""There are two different regions, the plains and hills,"" Bala Devi said. ""Those who live in the hills can't travel to the plains, and those in the plains can't go to the hills.""
The players at the top levels are still in action for clubs around the country and in national team training camps. ""It is lower down the levels where it may be a problem. It is a concern at the grassroots level and for younger girls who have had their lives disrupted,"" Bala Devi continued.
Such concerns could be costly for the state's future as a sporting superpower. ""Training grounds won't be maintained due to lack of funds as the government is busy spending on relief and rehabilitation, and practice sessions will be disrupted by frequent public shut-downs amid the intermittent violence,"" said Achom. 
""Players who live in the hills of Manipur won't be able to come to the state capital of Imphal, where sports infrastructure is available, due to road blockades and ethnic tensions. This is even before the psychological impact of the violence with players and their families as possible victims.""
Yet, while football and sports have taken a back seat during the recent troubles, there is hope that the game can show the way forward.
""I have played for my state and country for years, and all of us — Meiteis, Kukis or anyone else — have played for India, and it has never been an issue for us,"" said Bala Devi.
""We play and train together. Football is a unifying force, and there are no differences between us. The people in Manipur have been divided by violence, but football can bring them together,"" she added.
If Manipur can find peace and get back to playing football, then the future is bright for India's women, especially as the expansion of the World Cup from 24 to 32 teams has opened up the tournament to new nations. At the recent 2023 tournament, several smaller football nations performed well.
""If the Philippines can qualify, then so can we, as they were ranked behind India at the time,"" said Bala Devi. ""Morocco, Jamaica and Haiti have come up, and we can do it too."" 
It all comes back to time on the pitch and support. ""The main concern is that we don't get regular football, and the leagues are scattered in different states with a national league that lasts only a month or a month and a half, and we need seven to nine months.""
An Indian Super League for women could be a game-changer.
""The men's league is quite good now, and if we have the same support as the men, then we can qualify"" for the Women's World Cup, Bala Devi said. ""I want to play at the World Cup before I retire, and I will be 37 next time, and it would be great for India.""

https://www.dw.com/en/taiwan-typhoon-haikui-makes-second-landfall/a-66705629,NATURE AND ENVIRONMENT,Taiwan: Typhoon Haikui makes second landfall 03.09.2023,"Parts of Taiwan were grappling with floods, downed trees, and continued rainfall after Typhoon Haikui made a second landfall early on Monday. 
On Sunday, coastal Taitung bore the brunt of the typhoon's initial impact. The typhoon was downgraded to a severe tropical storm after its surprise second landfall in southwestern Kaohsiung.
Haikui initially appeared to move through the island and out to sea before the second landfall.
Over 7,000 were evacuated, hundreds of flights were canceled, and more than 217,000 households lost power. By Monday, 58,000 homes were still without electricity. There were no reports of any deaths.
Local reports highlighted significant flooding in Kaohsiung, and nearly 80 individuals suffered minor injuries during the storm.
Schools and businesses in 14 cities remained closed due to the heavy rain.

Typhoon Haikui brought torrential rain and strong winds to eastern Taiwan on Sunday becoming the first major storm to hit the island directly in four years.
On Sunday,President Tsai Ing-wen asked people to practice caution as Haikui ""will be the first typhoon to make landfall in Taiwan in four years."" 
She asked people to avoid going out and not to go up the mountains, to refrain from going towards the coast, fishing or engaging in water sports.
Taiwan has also mobilized its soldiers and other equipment like amphibious vehicles and inflatable rubber boats.
Haikui is now set to affect southern and northeastern regions.
According to the Tropical Storm Risk tracker, Typhoon Haikui was expected to be a category 1 or 2 typhoon when it hit Taiwan.

It is considered to be a much weaker storm in comparison to Typhoon Saola which hit Hong Kong and southern China on Saturday.
By Monday morning, China's national weather and ocean forecasters issued alerts for Haikui as it moved into the Taiwan Strait, heading towards China.
Taiwan last experienced a storm in 2019 called Typhoon Bailu which claimed one life.

The chancellor canceled all of his commitments for Sunday, a spokesperson said. However, his appointments for the upcoming week are unaffected.
The government said that the 65-year-old German leader had ""a small sports accident.""
The Frankfurter Rundschau daily cited Social Democratic (SPD) lawmaker Michael Roth as saying that the chancellor had canceled a citizens' dialogue event on Saturday because ""he was not feeling well.""
The German leader had been scheduled to attend events in the central state of Hesse, which is to hold a state election on October 8.
The mass-circulation Bild newspaper reported that the chancellor is feeling well, but that the bruising to his face is extensive enough to warrant avoiding public appearances at the moment.
On Monday, the chancellor is scheduled to take part in the St. Michael's annual reception of the Catholic Church in Berlin. On Wednesday, he is to give a speech on the federal budget in the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag.
On Friday he is heading to New Delhi for the the G20 summit. 
Scholz, who leads the SPD, has been chancellor since December 2021.
In a profile on his party's website, Scholz reveals that he disliked sports during school but later developed an appreciation for jogging thanks to his wife, Britta Ernst.
""Today I jog as often as I can,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-schools-see-rise-in-violence/a-66696582,SOCIETY,German schools see rise in violence 02.09.2023,"The summer vacation is coming to an end across Germany, but as students return to the classrooms, so is the specter of violence. ""The figures are alarming, the situation is frightening,"" said Gerhard Brand, head of Germany's second-largest teachers' union, VBE, which conducted a survey among school principals last year.
The survey found that two-thirds of respondents said their schools had seen violent incidents targeting teachers in the past five years, ranging from insults to physical attacks. In 2022, police in the northern state of Lower Saxony registered a rise in reported attacks on teachers by 30% on the previous year, and Saxony-Anhalt, in the east of the country, saw 104 attacks on teachers, 43 of them physical violence.
One teacher, who wished to remain anonymous, told DW that he had been attacked as he was trying to diffuse a situation in a classroom: He saw a student threaten another with a paper-knife and shout: ""I'll kill you!"" The teacher interfered but found the student turning on him instead. ""The student was so angry, he just felt he had to stab someone,"" recalled the teacher who was wounded in the incident. ""It was not a very young student, it really was an extreme situation.""
Incidents like these are not a daily occurrence, Brand added, but they are the tip of the iceberg. ""We estimate that the real number of attacks is much higher than what's being reported,"" he said, because many hesitate to report attacks on teachers at schools.
But Klaus Seifried, a school psychologist for the last 26 years and a member of the association of school psychologists warns against alarmism. ""We just pay more attention to such incidents nowadays and discuss them more,"" Seifried told DW.
A lot of experienced teachers are retiring, he adds. ""Many of the new teachers have less experience in defusing a situation. At the same time, they're facing more pressure as a staff shortage means they have to fill gaps and work overtime.""
By 2025, Germany will be lacking 25,000 teachers, according to the Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs (KMK) which represents education departments of Germany's 16 states. Under Germany's federalist structure, education comes are the state governments' remit.
The VBE survey found that 69% of school principals are anticipating an even more dramatic teacher shortage, and has calculated that the real number of vacancies may be as high as 50,000 in two years' time. Brand warns that the number of teachers will be insufficient for the foreseeable future, whatever measures are introduced. At the same time, teachers need more time to work with students to defuse situations in the classroom before they get out of control.

From 2020 to 2023, the COVID-19 pandemic was found to exacerbate existing problems, the VBE found. During that time, students and their parents were under a lot of pressure. With social distancing in place and sports facilities shut down, students were frustrated, which impacted school life, the teachers found. ""During the pandemic, students' days lacked structure, and many spent all their time in front of the computer or watching TV,"" said Seifried.
That, according to Brand, contributed to a change in attitude: ""As the pandemic wore on, we saw the initial solidarity increasingly replaced by aggression.""
The increased violence was notable not only among students but also among parents. In the eastern German state of Thuringia, for example, 56% of all verbal assaults on teachers were perpetrated by parents, and 70% of defamation targeting teachers on social media.
Thuringia had a high number of COVID-skeptics, and teachers who implemented existing regulations to curb the pandemic bore the brunt of the attacks. They were accused of using fascist methods, and of being Nazis, and one teacher reported being assaulted with kicks to the legs and abdomen by an irate parent.
Brand puts the increase in the number of attacks on teachers down to a general trend in society: ""There's more brutality and an increase in violence in everyday life,"" he said. ""We've noted an erosion of respect, of the willingness to help each other and general friendliness.""
But Seifried insists that this needn't simply be accepted. ""Teachers should build a positive, constructive relationship with their students, set boundaries and support them,"" he said. ""They should demonstrate authority, but also be positive role models.""

https://www.dw.com/en/spain-sports-court-opens-case-against-rubiales-over-kiss/a-66701774,SPORTS,Spain: Sports court opens case against Rubiales over kiss 02.09.2023,"Spain's top administrative court for sports opened a formal case against Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) head Luis Rubiales on Friday over his conduct at the Women's World Cup final in Sydney, Australia.
The Spanish government, however, said the case does not go far enough and has pushed for his immediate suspension.
Rubiales sparked outrage in Spain and around the world for grabbing the face of Spanish star Jenni Hermoso and forcibly kissing her on the lips at the televised victory ceremony.
He also grabbed his crotch when Spain beat England in the final — standing just a few feet away from Spain's Queen Letizia and her 16-year-old daughter.
The Sports Administrative Tribunal (TAD) launched a case against Rubiales over ""serious"" misconduct.
The court will decide whether the Spanish football president abused his authority or if he harmed Spain's reputation at a sporting event.
The designation is milder than some expected. If the court had opened a case into ""very serious"" misconduct, the country's National Sports Council (CSD) would have been able to suspend him from his role for the duration of the investigation.

Rubiales has already been provisionally suspended by FIFA for three months, but the Spanish government hopes the court will still move to provisionally suspend him from his RFEF role.
""When the eyes of the world were played on our players, his acts caused damage to our sport and our country that is difficult to repair,"" said Miquel Iceta, Spain's acting minister of culture and sport.
Shortly after the TAD announcement, Rubiales released a statement where he decried the public outrage as a ""witch hunt"" by ""false feminists.""
Rubiales has repeatedly sought to downplay his actions, calling the kiss consensual.
Hermoso, however, has said she did not consent to the kiss and felt vulnerable and the victim of an aggression. She has also accused the Spanish Football Federation of trying to pressure her into backing Rubiales.
Players unions in Spain announced a two-match strike in the women's domestic league over the Rubiales case, as well as protesting the treatment of female players and their pay.
The outrage over the case has overshadowed the Spanish team's historic Women's World Cup triumph, which culminated with a 1-0 victory against England on August 20.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-auto-show-chinas-carmakers-to-launch-ev-offensive/a-66687763,BUSINESS,German auto show: China's carmakers to launch EV offensive 01.09.2023,"The idea that the IAA is a show focused strictly on the automobile has been inaccurate for some time now. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic two years ago, the organizers — the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) — completely revamped the former auto show in an attempt to secure the survival of the fair as a ""globally unique mobility platform"" in a new location, namely Munich.
The IAA began in Berlin in 1897 and stayed there for 50 years before moving to Germany's financial hub of Frankfurt am Main.
Now in Munich for the second year in a row, the IAA wants to be seen as a showcase of ""urban mobility,"" exhibiting ""mobility ecosystems,"" and not merely a single mode of transportation, the automobile. The marketing pitch sounds like an excuse for the absence of many foreign automakers in Munich this year— indeed, more bicycle manufacturers are set to attend, whatever that says about the new IAA's appeal.
Quite naturally, the big three of the German automobile industry — Volkswagen (VW), BMW and Mercedes-Benz — have a vested interest in holding the event in their home market. But the list of globally known brands represented in Munich is shorter than ever, with, apart from the German heavyweights, only Renault from France and Stellantis Group's Opel brand.
A handful of exotic newcomers to the electric vehicle market like Lucid from the United States and Croatian electric sports car maker Rimac are also present. Vietnam's Vinfast EV company withdrew its participation at short notice, no reason given.
In the absence of the auto industry's big whales, some of the small fry are looking to create a splash on the European car market. One of them is BYD — initials stand for Build Your Dreams — a Chinese manufacturer based in the industrial hub of Shenzhen.
In China, BYD is an industry whale itself, especially with its battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) that are so successful that BYD last year replaced VW as Chinese market leader by sales. BYD is now building the dream of conquering the European market with its BEVs and plans to showcase six of its models at the IAA.
BYD used to be a manufacturer of smartphone batteries, but is now applying the know-how gathered in its early days to produce state-of-the-art batteries for EVs.
BYD car batteries do not require nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which makes them less expensive to produce. In terms of software and technical innovations, China's EV makers have also made big strides in recent years, and are now on the cutting edge of digital applications for cars.
China-made EVs are still few and far between on German roads — BYD has sold 1,448 cars so far, while VW has delivered 207,000 EVs in Germany. However, experts believe BYD and other Chinese EV makers will be able to win customers in Europe with significantly lower prices for their cars.
There is precedence: In the 1980s and 1990s, carmakers from Japan and South Korea were initially laughed at for their cars, but they then steadily increased their market share through lower prices and better quality.

Despite the shortage of big names at this year's IAA, exhibition halls are 90% booked, according to the VDA industry group. IAA's design concept has been changed and now includes two separate locations — the main exhibition center for professional visitors and a so-called Open Space in downtown Munich for the general public.
BYD said it will showcase its cars at both locations. Perhaps it was this Chinese IAA dominance that made the organizers bend over backward to ensure the presence of the world's most valuable carmaker: Tesla. It is not known, however, why CEO Elon Musk has finally given in to VDA's courting, as Tesla usually prefers to organize its own special events to promote its technology.
Tesla, BYD and the German carmakers are currently locked in a fierce battle for bigger shares of the emerging EV market in Europe. After overcoming supply-chain snarls amid the COVID pandemic, German auto giants are back in expansion mode with surging sales and profits in the second quarter.
Auto experts predict challenging times ahead, however. ""China is well on its way to becoming an automotive superpower,"" said consulting firm AlixPartners in a note to investors recently, and added that the era of record profits for German manufacturers is ""coming to an end.""
Consultants at EY also sense ""strong headwinds"" for legacy manufacturers in their home markets.
As far as the world's biggest car market China is concerned, more than one study predicts domestic manufacturers reigning supreme, with their market share surging to about 65% by 2030.

https://www.dw.com/en/christoph-freund-who-is-bayern-munichs-new-sporting-director/a-66691323,SPORTS,Christoph Freund: Who is Bayern Munich's new sporting director? 01.09.2023,"The Austrian, born in 1977, was a player until 2013 but never played higher than the second tier in his home country. In the last few years, he's worked in Red Bull Salzburg's management team, initially as team manager in 2006, then as sports coordinator in 2012 and finally as sporting director in 2015, succeeding Ralf Rangnick.
In the eight seasons before his move to Bayern Munich, the Red Bull outfit has been the dominant force in Austrian football, winning the championship eight times and the cup six times.
The position had become vacant because Freund's predecessor, Hasan Salihamidzic, was fired along with CEO Oliver Kahn in May, immediately after Bayern's final game of the season, when they narrowly won the Bundesliga championship. The Munich team had experienced a largely unsatisfactory season. After the poorly handled coaching change from Julian Nagelsmann to Thomas Tuchel, the team was eliminated early in the German Cup against Freiburg and the Champions League against Manchester City. In addition, Salihamidzic had failed to manage the succession of top goalscorer Robert Lewandowski satisfactorily. His ""king transfer,"" Sadio Mane, flopped.
The 46-year-old has a good eye for talent and is considered a skilled negotiator in transfer deals. During his time at Salzburg, future stars such as Erling Haaland, Karim Adeyemi, Dominik Szoboszlai and many other top talents arrived. Freund also earned RB Salzburg big transfer profits with many players who attracted attention with eye-catching performances in the Austrian league.
Haaland arrived from Norway for €8 million ($8.7 million), made just 22 competitive appearances for Salzburg and scored 28 goals, and was sold to Borussia Dortmund for €20 million. Szoboszlai arrived within the Red Bull construct in 2018 for half a million euros from training team FC Liefering and was transferred to RB Leipzig for €36 million after three years.
Another example is U.S. international Brenden Aaronson, who arrived at Salzburg from Philadelphia Union for €12.7 million in January 2021 and departed for Leeds for €32.8 million 18 months later.
Discovering and nurturing talent is not limited to players, though. Many coaches who shone in Red Bull's Austrian empire are now employed as head coaches in the Bundesliga and other top leagues. RB Leipzig's Marco Rose, Bo Svensson of Mainz and Bochum coach Thomas Letsch currently ply their trade in Germany's top flight.
In addition to achieving the greatest possible sporting success, which is taken for granted at Bayern, Freund would like to focus more on youth again. After the era of homegrown stars such as Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thomas Müller and others, talent graduating from the club's academy has become a rarity. The last player to make it into the Bundesliga as a regular from the Bayern Campus, the club's youth development center, was Jamal Musiala — and even he had been at Chelsea for eight years beforehand.
""The biggest challenge will be to develop young players into great players. There is still room for improvement, and the Campus can become even more important,"" the new sporting director was quoted as saying on Bayern's website.
But Bayern fans can still look forward to more star signings like Harry Kane: ""We want to bring a few players through from the Campus, but we will also keep bringing in top players,"" Freund promised. ""The important thing is a mix of both.""

https://www.dw.com/en/chess-sexism/a-66685808,SPORTS,Chess and sexism: Can the game be made safer for women? 01.09.2023,"""I guarantee you there is no woman who would say she has never heard a stupid remark,"" Ingrid Lauterbach told DW. The president of the German Chess Federation (DSB) has herself experienced situations where someone wanted to hug her, give her a kiss on the cheek, or worse — without her consent.
Lauterbach is an international chess champion and has played in international tournaments for decades. While she has never experienced any physical assault, she knows the typical comments all too well. The chess world, including the DSB, needs to address the elephant in the room — sexism.
Chess had its very own #MeToo moment at the beginning of August. Affected women from the world of chess rallied together to write an open letter demanding change.
""We female chess players, coaches, referees and managers have experienced sexism or sexual violence at the hands of male chess players, coaches, referees or managers,"" the letter read. It was signed by more than 100 women from around the world.
One of them is German national player Annmarie Mütsch. She recently told German news magazine ""Spiegel"" that she had canceled her participation in important tournaments in order to avoid certain people she would rather not meet.
So is chess particularly affected by sexism? Grandmaster and DSB spokesperson Josefine Heinemann doesn't think so. ""Of course, I have been hit on at a chess tournament before and maybe it was a little bit uncomfortable. But I wouldn't classify that as sexual harassment,"" Heinemann said.
Situations like those aren't exclusive to the chess environment, she said, they are part of everyday life. It is a problem facing society as a whole.
There is, however, one major difference in chess: Women are greatly in the minority, with only 10% of all players identifying as female. Women-only tournaments do exist, but if female players want to challenge themselves at the top level, they have to take part in mixed tournaments to advance their careers.
It's also unique to chess that younger women often compete face-to-face against older men, which can cause annoyance if the woman wins. ""There is often a comment, especially when older men lose to younger girls,"" Heinemann said.
The grandmaster, however, sees an even greater danger beyond the chessboard. ""From my point of view, there are already a lot of stupid comments on the internet. Some things I read on there leave me shocked.""
The internet provides anonymity, and the inhibition threshold falls drastically. Lauterbach also believes that modern communication channels and chess websites make it easier to communicate with people against their will. On the other hand, the internet also provides a platform for those affected by sexism to fight back.
Women no longer want to stay silent. In February, two times US champion and influential chess writer Jennifer Shahade posted on what was then called Twitter, but is now known as X: ""Time's up."" In her post, she described the sexual misconduct she had allegedly experienced at the hands of chess grandmaster Alejandro Ramirez. 
Within minutes, many people commented, detailing similar experiences in the past. Among them was a man who confessed he had witnessed Ramirez allegedly assaulting a young woman in 2011, but he didn't think it was an issue back then.
By that time, various abuse scandals had already caused uproar worldwide. So how did no one seemingly notice anything in chess? Ramirez says he is cooperating with various investigations and looks forward to giving his side of the story.
Were such allegations just all too common in the past?
According to German player Mütsch: ""Since I signed the open letter, I've thought more about the incidents I've experienced. I've thought of so many things that I wasn't even aware of before."" 
American-Canadian chess player and influencer Alexandra Valeria Botez set up an initiative for an anonymous, international database to collect cases of sexual harassment and abuse in chess worldwide. A reaction she deemed necessary, as no major steps have been taken by the World Chess Federation (FIDE) and except for the Ethics Commission, there is no point of contact for those affected by sexual misconduct. 
The commission, however, wouldn't be the right place to go, according to Lauterbach. She says the commission works very slowly and it would certainly be better to address those responsible face-to-face. She has one wish for the future: ""That everyone pays closer attention. And that goes for the referees and coaches too.""
Looking forward, she believes it is particularly important to get more girls and women into the sport at all levels. 
The German Chess Federation has been working on measures to prevent sexual harassment and violence in the sport since 2021 and is looking to expand this concept further. Its website directs users to a contact person solely for this purpose. In Germany, that point of contact is provided by the ""Safe Sport Contact Point"", which is run by the government, the states and organized sports.
Lauterbach hopes that better education at the grassroots level can bring greater awareness of sexism in chess. It must be very clear to all that such behavior will not be tolerated, she said.
""I think we have to get to the point where the deterrent is so high that no one can allow themselves to do this anymore.""

Bonmati, also part of Barcelona's Women's Champions League-winning team, helped Spain seal their first World Cup title in Australia and New Zealand last month. The celebrations, however, were overshadowed by Rubiales forcibly kissed midfielder Hermoso on the lips during the trophy presentation.
""We're not talking about the title because things that should not have happened have taken place,"" Bonmati said at the award ceremony, whch was part of the men's Champions League group stage draw. 
""As a society, we should not allow abuse of power in the work environment.
""I would like to tell my team-mate Jenni and all women who have been through the same thing: We're with you. We're working to make this a better society.""
Coach Sarina Wiegman was named women's coach of the year after England finished runners-up to Spain Down Under.
""I would like to dedicate this award to the Spanish team. This team deserves to be celebrated and deserves to be listened to, and I'm going to give them again a big applause and I hope you will join,"" she told the audience.

Manchester City's Erling Haaland won the men's award after scoring 52 goals in 53 games as City won the treble of Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup.
""To be able to do this with my teammates it's really special and it gives me motivation to keep working,"" Haaland said.
As for the draw, Bayern Munich will have Manchester United in their Champions League group as the 1999 finalists meet in what could be two more classic encounters.
Joining Bayern and United in Group A will be FC Copenhagen and Galatasaray.
Bayern's clash with United will arguably be the most anticipated of the entire group stage, with the two clubs winning nine European Cups between them.
Their most memorable match saw the English club coming from behind to win the trophy with two goals in the last two minutes of the final 24 years ago.
It will also mean a swift return to English soil for Harry Kane, who recently joined the Bavarians from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in excess of €100 million ($108 million).

Elsewhere, Real Madrid will face off against Italian champions Napoli in Group C as the Spanish outfit seek a record-extending 15th title in Europe's premier competition. Joining the two clubs will be Sporting Braga and Union Berlin, making their first appearance in the Champions League.
The UEFA event took place at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco and saw Borussia Dortmund get a nightmare draw, as they will come up against Paris St. German, 7-times winners AC Milan, and Newcastle United, making their first appearance in the tournament in 20 years.
Last season's Champions League winners Manchester City were drawn in a group that contained RB Leipzig, Young Boys Bern and Red Star Belgrade, who won the European Cup in 1991.
Arsenal, PSV Eindhoven, Sevilla and RC Lens were drawn together in Group B while Barcelona will have to pit their wits against  Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk and Royal Antwerp of Belgium.
The remaining two groups saw last season's runners-up Inter Milan placed in a group alongside Benfica, RB Salzburg and Real Sociedad, while Feyenoord, Atletico Madrid, Celtic and Lazio were drawn together.
Miroslav Klose was given the UEFA President's Award to recognize the fair play he demonstrated throughout his career, including the then-Lazio striker admitting to handling the ball as it went past Napoli goalkeeper Morgan De Sanctis, before the striker informed the referee and the initial decision to award a goal was reversed.
The career of the former Germany forward was hailed by UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin as ""not only a testament to determination and skill but also sportsmanship that transcends the borders of professionalism and the sport itself.""

https://www.dw.com/en/us-open-tennis-with-work-to-do-50-years-on-from-first-equal-pay-triumph/a-66674330,SPORTS,US Open: Tennis with work to do 50 years on from first equal pay triumph 31.08.2023,"A rousing applause went through New York's Arthur Ashe Stadium on Tuesday when former US first lady Michelle Obama introduced tennis legend Billie Jean King on the court.
Waving to the crowd with tears in her eyes, the 79-year-old hugged Obama before making her way to the microphone stand in the packed arena. Visibly caught up in emotion, all she managed at first was a big sigh.
King retired from tennis in 1983 after an illustrious career that included winning 12 Grand Slam singles titles. But her most significant victory came off the court. On the opening night of the 2023 tournament, King celebrated the 50th anniversary of the US Open becoming the first sporting event to offer equal prize money to female and male competitors.
This year's final Grand Slam tournament offers a record purse of $65 million (€60 million) and caps off 17 consecutive years with pay equity at all four Grand Slams. King, the woman who ""made it all possible,"" in Obama's words, found herself lost for words in the center of the biggest tennis stadium in the world.
In her tribute, Obama recalled how King, the US Open champion in 1972, allied with her fellow women's tennis players, threatening to boycott the tournament the following year unless women got the same prize money as men. That same summer, it was announced that the women's winner's purse would increase by $15,000 (€13,800), meaning that both men's and women's champions would each receive $25,000 (€23,000).
In 2007, Wimbledon was the last of the Grand Slam tournaments, along with the French Open, to move to equal pay for both genders, 39 years after the open era of tennis began in 1968.
""Women's tennis is the leader in women's sports,"" King said during her speech. ""But while we celebrate today, our work is far from done.""
The work she is referring to was on show in the lead-up tournaments to this year's US Open. The Canadian Open offered a total prize pool of $9.4 million, of which only $2.8 million went to the women's draw. In comparison, the men pocketed $6.6 million despite players from both sexes playing the same amount of sets in the competition.
Since 2021, in even-numbered years, the men's tournament has been held in Montreal, while the women's competition is held in Toronto, and vice versa in odd-numbered years. Some argue that the revenue of the men's tournament brings more spectators through the gates and generates more TV money.
Even some stars of the game, like Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, bought into that narrative. ""The stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men's tennis matches,"" said Djokovic at the 2016 Indian Wells Masters. ""I think that's one of the reasons why maybe we should get awarded more.""
Nadal made similar remarks at the 2019 Australian Open: ""If they sell more tickets than what we sell tickets, they deserve more than us."" Both have since backtracked, voicing their support for a union of the men's and women's governing bodies.
A week after the Canadian Open, the discrepancy in prize money was on show again at the Cincinnati Masters, even though the women's and men's draws took place at the same venue, meaning fans paid the same amount of money to watch men's and women's matches.
But yet again, the men's champion Djokovic took home around $1 million (€920,000) in prize money, while his female counterpart Coco Gauff had to settle for roughly $450,000 (€420,000) — less than half. Women's tennis might be making progress, but it is still very much playing catch-up. 
Former world No. 1  Andy Murray is one of the biggest advocates for equal pay in tennis. Confronted with the disparity in prize money before his first match in Cincinnati, Murray said the governing bodies of tennis — the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), which manages the men's tour, and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), which manages the women's — have to work together to find a solution.
""I always felt like when we're competing at the same event on the same courts, we should be playing for the same prize money,"" said the former Wimbledon champion. ""It is difficult for it ever to become truly equal until the ATP and the WTA sort of actually combine and work together.""
In a first step in that direction, the WTA announced in June that all combined 1000- and 500-level events, the sport's top competitions outside the Grand Slams, will offer equal prize money by 2027. The non-combined tournaments will do so by 2033.
If everything goes to plan, Billie Jean King will be 89 years old by the time prize money in professional tennis will be evenly distributed between men and women. Half a century after the tennis champion's activism won equal pay for women at the 1973 US Open, she still leads a fight for equity far from done.
Before leaving the stage on Tuesday, King finished her speech with a quote from American civil rights activist Coretta Scott King: ""Struggle is a never-ending process. Freedom is never really won. You earn it, and you win it in every generation.""

https://www.dw.com/en/china-issues-highest-warning-as-typhoon-saola-approaches/a-66680331,NATURE AND ENVIRONMENT,China issues highest warning as Typhoon Saola approaches 31.08.2023,"Hong Kong and mainland China braced on Thursday for Typhoon Saola, which is expected to bring winds of over 200 kph (125 mph) as it heads to the southeastern coastline.
Beijing issued the highest typhoon warning, with state media saying at least 121 passenger trains were suspending services in anticipation. Train suspensions mostly affected key lines running from north to south, and they are due to stay until September 6.

The typhoon is expected to make landfall along the coast in the province of Guangzhou to Hong Kong on the afternoon or night of Friday, China's National Meteorological Center said. The center forecasted it would be among the five strongest typhoons to land in Guangzhou since 1949.
The province's Shenzhen city prepared by suspending classes at nurseries, kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, and upgrading its typhoon warning level to yellow, the second lowest, as of 6 p.m. local time on Thursday.
Hong Kong also braced for the powerful typhoon. The city's leader, John Lee, requested various government departments to plan ahead and urged residents to take precautionary measures.
However, it is still unclear whether the new school year would begin on Friday, as previously planned for many students.
The Hong Kong Observatory urged residents to steer clear of water sports and coastal areas.
The typhoon passed on Wednesday just south of Taiwan. It then made a turn to mainland China, hitting the island's southern cities with heavy rain and strong winds.
Earlier this week, Saola also hit the Philippines, yet with no reports of casualties so far. The country's north , however, suffered floods hitting low-lying villages, with some 50,000 displaced.
Some 100 houses were damaged. Seaports also suspended inter-city ferry services due to rough seas.

https://www.dw.com/en/zip-it-up-the-zippers-130-year-history/a-66660527,LIFESTYLE,Zip it up: The zipper's 130-year history 29.08.2023,"It has perhaps lost in popularity through the COVID pandemic, as people working from home often prefer elastic waistband pants. But whenever we are required to get out of the house, it reappears everywhere on our coats, trousers and bags: the zipper.
Work-from-home style isn't the first challenge the zipper has faced throughout its 130-year history, with button-fly jeans regularly making a fashion comeback. And everyone knows how frustrating it can be when a zipper gets stuck.
But 130 years after its patent was registered, the zipper has defended its title as an ultimate fashion accessory.
Early models of a similar clothing fastener were launched as early as the 1850s. But they rusted and often opened unintentionally. They were awkward to use and too expensive.
An American traveling salesman, Whitcomb Judson, developed an improved version of the fastener in 1890, receiving a patent for his ""clasp locker"" on August 29, 1893. Shortly after, he presented his invention at the Chicago World's Fair.
Judson's clasp locker was designed as an alternative to long shoelaces on boots. But apparently, not everyone found tying shoes tedious, and his invention was met with widespread indifference.
It took another decade for Judson and his partners to relaunch the device after improving its technology. Other engineers continued to optimize the invention, including in Europe.
When serial production of the mechanism started, the US military became one of its first bulk buyers, integrating zippers into the troops' clothing and gear during World War I. 
It wasn't until the late 1930s that the invention finally revolutionized fashion.
As was often the case for fashion innovations at the time, the zipper was initially used only for men's clothing, as it was deemed inappropriate for women to wear clothes that could be taken off quickly.
When finally applied to women's clothes, zippers were placed discretely on the side instead of in the crotch area to avoid drawing attention to a woman's intimate parts.
In Germany, mostly men wore fly trousers until the late 1960s when jeans became accepted as a genderless clothing item.
But to this day, many manufacturers still design pants differently according to gender: Zippers in women's fashion are traditionally zipped up with the left hand; for men's clothes, with the right hand. It's a legacy of the pre-zipper era when button plackets in women's fashion were designed for wealthy ladies dressed by their maids.
Now, this distinction hardly exists with unisex clothing, even though it is still the norm for shirts, blouses and suits.
Initially made of metal, zippers were later made of other materials, such as nylon and plastic. Manufacturers have also developed zippers that can open from both ends.
But beyond the technological improvements, the basic principle has remained the same: The zipper is made of two flexible strips of fabric with rows of metal or plastic teeth that fasten by hooking into each other when pushed together by a slider.
At the end of the 1950s, US space agency NASA also contributed to zipper technology when developing its high-pressure space suits, designing an air-tight sealed zip that could withstand pressure. They were used during the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969, the first moon landing.
However, the suits were not suitable for longer ventures into space, as are common nowadays, which is why NASA discarded the zipper. Yet fire-resistant and chemical-resistant successors to the NASA technology are still in demand today, notably in gear for fire departments and chemical plants.
The zipper has also found its way into pop culture. Hollywood rebels Marlon Brando in ""The Wild One"" (1953) and James Dean in ""Rebel Without a Cause"" (1955) sported an iconic style, casually wearing their jackets half-zipped up.
Even in 1971, the zipper still managed to spark controversy. That year, The Rolling Stones released their legendary album ""Sticky Fingers,"" whose album cover was designed by pop art icon Andy Warhol.
It featured an actual metal zipper. Although it didn't reveal any genitalia when unzipped, just relatively harmless cotton briefs, it was seen as scandalous at the time.
In Spain, Franco's regime censored the ""obscene"" album, which led to an alternate version being designed, depicting a woman's fingers crawling out of a tin can of syrup — which many find far more disturbing than zip-up pants. The track ""Sister Morphine"" also had to be removed from ""Sticky Fingers"" for the Spanish market, even though almost all of the album's tracks also revolved around drugs, from ""Brown Sugar"" to ""Bitch.""
Today, 130 years after it was first patented, the zipper is here to stay. Japan's YKK group, the world's largest zipper manufacturer, produces an estimated 1.5 billion units annually.
It's simply part of our daily lives, mainly going unnoticed — until it gets stuck again.

https://www.dw.com/en/luis-rubiales-kiss-resignation/a-66655064,SOCCER,Spain football federation demands Luis Rubiales to resign over kiss 28.08.2023,"Spain's football federation asked Luis Rubiales to resign as president on Monday night after he kissed Jenni Hermoso on the lips at the Women's World Cup.
The regional presidents of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) held a second emergency meeting after Rubiales repeatedly refused to step down in recent days, sparking national and international outrage.
""After recent events and the unacceptable behavior that has seriously damaged the image of Spanish football, the presidents request that Luis Rubiales resign immediately as president of the RFEF,"" the football federation said in a statement.
Hermoso previously said she ""felt vulnerable and a victim of an assault, an impulsive, macho act, out of place and with no type of consent on my part.""
The statement from the football federation officials also urged an overhaul in the organization's management — something many Spanish players have demanded in the wake of the incident.
""We will urge the relevant authorities to carry out a profound and imminent organizational restructuring in strategic positions of the federation in order to make way for a new stage in the management of Spanish football,"" it read.
Women football players worldwide have voiced solidarity with Hermoso over the past week.
The Spanish national women's team signed a joint letter with Hermoso saying they would no longer represent their country unless the current leadership of the football federation is removed.
Further afield, women in football and their male counterparts have formed a chorus condemning Rubiales' actions and his refusal to step down.
Former Germany goalkeeper and two-time Women's World Cup winner Nadine Angerer said the incident has deeply affected players.
""It's absolutely disgusting what happened,"" Angerer told DW on Monday.
""You just won a World Cup. You are happy, you worked such a long time for this moment. And at the biggest event for women worldwide, everybody speaks about one man.""

Angerer is now the goalkeeping coach for the Portland Thorns in the United States.
She said the young women in her team have been heartened by the worldwide solidarity from seasoned football players.
""They are shocked, of course,"" she said.
""But at the same time, they're very proud that the solidarity worldwide is with Jenni Hermoso.""
Numerous teams have also held banners in support of Hermoso, including Atletico Madrid where she got her professional start and Pachuca in Mexico, where she currently plays.
Angerer said more needs to be done to make sure the men connected to women's football demonstrate ""awareness and just normal respect.""
This is a position echoed by FIFA, which has provisionally suspended Rubiales and ordered him and not to contact Hermoso or those around her.
The suspension will last for 90 days, pending the outcome of FIFA disciplinary proceedings that will determine whether Rubiales violated ""the basic rules of decent conduct"" and behaved ""in a way that brings the sport into disrepute.""

Rubiales could also face consequences at home after Spanish prosecutors opened a sexual assault case on Monday.
The head of Spain's sports regulatory body Victor Francos, who is also the country's sports minister, will also bring Rubiales before a tribunal, which could potentially lead to him being suspended from his position as head of the Royal Spanish Football Federation.
""I think we can say it is the 'MeToo' of Spanish football,"" Francos told journalists last week.
""There has to be a change,"" he added. ""The government wants to warn, to be very clear and say that there are things that can't happen again.""

https://www.dw.com/en/spain-football-luis-rubiales-kiss/a-66651714,SOCCER,Luis Rubiales under fire: The consequences of a World Cup kiss 28.08.2023,"For over a week now, Luis Rubiales, president of the Spanish Football Association (RFEF), has been the most talked about man in the world of sports. 
The discussion revolves around an incident involving Spain forward Jenni Hermoso after the nation's World Cup triumph in Australia. When Hermoso stepped up to the podium to receive a winner's medal and congratulations from FIFA President Gianni Infantino, Spain's Queen Letizia and Rubiales, the RFEF chief kissed her on the cheek before grabbing her head and kissing her on the lips.
Hermoso, 33, has since said that the kiss was not consensual, prompting criticism of Rubiales from politicians, clubs and former and current male and female players. Many view it as another abuse of power in a patriarchal organization.
With many questions surrounding this ever-changing story, DW breaks down what you need to know.
Rubiales, 46, has vehemently refused to resign amid calls for him to step down as RFEF president. However, FIFA's Disciplinary Committee has since provisionally suspended the RFEF chief to preserve ""the fundamental rights"" of Hermoso.

Rubiales has been banned from all national and international football-related activities. The suspension is initially for 90 days, pending disciplinary proceedings initiated by FIFA last Thursday. World football's governing body ordered Rubiales not to contact Hermoso or her immediate entourage, either personally or through a third party. The same applies to the Spanish federation RFEF and its officials and employees.
On Monday, prosecutors in Spain said they had launched a sexual assault investigation into Rubiales. According to a statement received by the AFP news agency from the Spanish national court, ""prosecutors from the national court have opened a preliminary investigation to look into the facts, which could constitute an offense of sexual assault."" The statement indicated the court would offer Hermoso a chance to file a lawsuit.
Later that evening, the regional presidents of the RFEF released a joint statement publicly demanding Rubiales step down.
Spain's government promptly reacted to Rubiales' vehement refusal to step down. 
""Logically, we will do everything in our power to ensure that this gentleman, who can hardly be called a worthy representative of Spanish football, is no longer at the forefront of Spanish football,"" Teresa Ribera, Spain's caretaker deputy head of government, told the Europa Press news agency. 
Spanish football legends such as Andres Iniesta and Bayer Leverkusen coach Xabi Alonso have also expressed their horror.
""It's obvious that he has to go. He was never accepted. He has not behaved correctly and cannot stay in this position,"" Alonso said on Sky Germany.
Hermoso, the victim in all this, reiterated in a statement once again that the kiss was not consensual. She announced that she would no longer play for Spain's national team as long as the current leadership remained in place. 
Over 81 players have now joined this boycott in solidarity, including all 23 World Cup winners, leaving Spain without a women's national team. Furthermore, 11 staff members resigned, including assistants of controversial national team coach Jorge Vilda.
On the other side of the scandal, Rubiales' family publicly has demanded that Hermoso ""tell the truth."" According to the Spanish press, his mother, Angeles Bejar, has gone on an ""indefinite"" hunger strike to protest the ongoing ""inhumane and bloody manhunt."" 
Bejar has locked herself in the church in her hometown of Motril, Spain and has said she does not want to eat until her son sees justice. An aunt is also said to have joined the hunger strike.
Spain's RFEF has called an ""extraordinary and urgent"" meeting to discuss the consequences of FIFA's decision to suspend Rubiales. His refusal to step down has caused national and international outrage, but on Monday the regional presidents of the RFEF held a second emergency meeting before releasing a statement asking for Rubiales to step down. 
""After recent events and the unacceptable behavior that has seriously damaged the image of Spanish football, the presidents request that Luis Rubiales resign immediately as president of the RFEF,"" the football federation said in a statement. Now the world is waiting to see how Rubiales will respond.
 
In conjunction with the RFEF meeting, Yolanda Diaz, Spain's second vice president, also plans to meet with the president of FUTPRO, a players' union exclusively for women footballers, and representatives of the Spanish players' organization AFE.
If Rubiales remains in office, it would be difficult for FIFA to award the 2030 Men's World Cup to Spain, who are involved in a joint bid to host the tournament with Portugal and Morocco. The three countries' cross-continental bid is considered the most promising of all contenders.
The impact was almost felt at the club level based on threats made by RFEF General Secretary Andreu Camps, who denounced the Spanish government's intervention to the European football governing body UEFA. He said the demands for Rubiales' resignation and announcements to ensure his ouster were political interference in sporting matters.
According to UEFA regulations, such an act would result in the federation being banned from all competitions. Prominent clubs like Real Madrid and Barcelona would not be allowed to compete in the Champions League or other UEFA competitions. Camps' aim was to pressure the government to withdraw its demands for resignation, but UEFA first denied the RFEF's request, before it was then later withdrawn.
Jorge Vilda, Spain's controversial national women's team head coach, has also distanced himself from Rubiales — but only belatedly. Vilda had always been supported by Rubiales, even when 15 players resigned from the national team last year as they sought to have Vilda step down.
Last Friday, during Rubiales' blazing speech, which denounced criticism of him as, among other things, ""false feminism,"" Vilda was still sitting in the audience applauding Rubiales when he repeatedly shouted, ""I will not resign!"" A day later, Vilda apparently changed his view — in a statement Saturday night, the world champion coach condemned Rubiales' behavior.
""I deeply regret that the success of Spanish women's football has been affected by the inappropriate behavior of our president Luis Rubiales, which he himself has admitted,"" read Vilda's statement, published in Spanish media. 
Despite most of his backroom staff resigning in protest, Vilda remains in his post. But on Tuesday, the RFEF said it was exploring options as to whether it can sack its women's World Cup-winning head coach.

This is Nagura's third air guitar title.
The Japanese performer is now the most decorated air guitar player in the 28 years the competition has been held, organizers said.
Second place went to Aapo ""the Angus"" Rautio from Finland. The host nation's competitor won the event the first five consecutive years it was held, but Finland has never been able to claim the top spot since.
Last year's winner Kirill ""Guitarantula"" Blumenkrants, now representing France but formerly a winner as a Russian competitor in 2015 as well, finished third.
A total of 18 people competed in the 2023 championship in Oulu.
Air guitar refers to simulating the playing of a guitar without holding an instrument. Competitors perform to music at the competition.
The championship has been held each year since 1996 — with the exception of 2020 when COVID stopped the event — and was founded in the central Finnish city of Oulu.
""Air guitar playing is not instrumental sports or arts, nor does it require any special venues or skills, so it is accessible to all,"" organizers said in a statement. ""Air guitar can be grasped regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, sexual orientation and social status.""
The organization said that it aimed to ""promote world peace"" through air guitar.
The Air Guitar Championships are part of the broader Oulu August Festivals, which includes a number of cultural events.

""The chairman of the FIFA Disciplinary Committee... has decided today to provisionally suspend Mr Luis Rubiales from all football-related activities at national and international level,"" FIFA said in a statement on Saturday.
The action was taken to preserve ""the fundamental rights"" of Hermoso.
FIFA also ordered Rubiales and the Spanish football federation not to contact Hermoso or those around her.
The suspension period will initially last for 90 days, pending the outcome of disciplinary proceedings that FIFA opened against Rubiales on Thursday.
The Spanish football federation later said Rubiales would defend himself against the suspension.
""Luis Rubiales has stated that he will legally defend himself in the competent bodies, he fully trusts FIFA and reiterates that, in this way, he is given the opportunity to begin his defense so that the truth prevails and his complete innocence is proven,"" the federation said in a statement.
The entire women's team and many more players said the would no longer represent Spain until Rubiales steps down.
The suspension comes after the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) threatened to take legal action against Hermoso.
In a statement published late on Friday, it said it would take ""as many legal actions as necessary to defend the honor of the President of the RFEF."" Rubiales meanwhile said this week that he considered himself the target of a ""social assassination."" 
It said that it had attempted to contact Hermoso but was unsuccessful in receiving a response.
""In a state governed by the rule of law, as [Rubiales] has argued, opinions are countered with facts and evidence and lies are refuted in court,"" it said. It did not specify what the legal action would consist of.
The RFEF said that the federation would prove that claims that had been ""spread either in [Hermoso's] name [...] or by the player herself"" were ""lies.""
In its statement, the federation published three photos and claimed they showed that Hermoso had lifted Rubiales up during a hug, meaning that the federation boss ""could not exert any force.""
However, the photos were seemingly taken before Rubiales kissed Hermoso on the lips.

Earlier, Hermoso said: ""I want to make clear that, as was seen in the images, I did not at any point consent to the kiss he gave me and of course I definitely did not try to lift up [Rubiales].""
The player also said that she felt ""vulnerable and like the victim of an assault.""
RFEF had claimed that Hermoso said that the kiss was a ""mutual gesture"" between her and Rubiales, which the player later said was falsely attributed to her.
""I won't tolerate anyone putting in doubt my word and even more so that anyone invents words that I did not say,"" she said.
Spain's National Sports Council (CSD) submitted a request for the country's administrative court for sports (TAD) to suspend Rubiales over ""unacceptable behavior.""
The council said that it considered that Rubiales had abused his authority and had committed public acts that had infringed on dignity or decorum in sports.
""Both infringements are considered 'very serious,' which allows for the adoption of a measure of provisional suspension of Luis Rubiales as the president of the [RFEF],"" it said in its petition.
Rubiales on Friday refused to resign following broad condemnation of his conduct. FIFA has also launched its own proceedings against the Spanish football boss.
""Mr Rubiales has not lived up to what was expected of him,"" CSD president Victor Francos said. ""His reaction has disappointed us.""
On Wednesday, the Spanish player's union, FUTPRO, issued a joint statement calling for action to be taken against Rubiales.
The England women's team, who lost against Spain in the World Cup final, expressed their solidarity on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, saying: ""We all stand with you Jenni Hermoso and all players of the Spanish team.""
They also slammed the ""Unacceptable actions allowed to happen by a sexist and patriarchal organisation. Abuse is abuse and we have all seen the truth.""
Meanwhile, the head of Germany's FC Bayern Munich Karl-Heinz Rummenigge defended Rubiales' behavior, saying it was ""absolutely OK,"" comments for which he drew widespread condemnation.
""When you become a world champion, you get emotional. And what he did there is, with all due respect, absolutely OK,"" he said, adding that he had ""kissed men"" when the team won the 2020 World Cup.
On Saturday, German Bundesliga fans condemned both Rubiales' behaviour and Rummenigge's defense of him.
During a match against Werder Bremen, Freiburg fans held held a banner that read: ""A fist instead of a kiss for Rubiales and Rummenigge — sorry, with all due respect — absolutely OK.""
freiburg supporters also held another banner reflecting on the week-long saga.
""Balance of power played out perfectly again,"" it read. ""Women win the World Cup — everyone's talking about toxic masculinity.""

Rubiales was widely condemned in Spain after he kissed star player Jenni Hermoso on the lips without her consent at the Women's World Cup last Sunday.
In the days that followed, he rejected repeated calls to step down and defended his kiss as ""mutual, euphoric, and consensual.""
But Hermoso denied this in a letter signed by 56 female Spanish football players on Friday.
""I want to clarify that just as the images suggest, at no point did I consent to the kiss he gave me,"" Hermoso said in the statement.
""I do not tolerate that my word be questioned,"" Hermoso said, rejecting any statements that had been attributed to her by Rubiales in his speech.
She and the other signatories said they would not return to the team unless the federation leadership is removed.
""We want to express that all the players signing this letter will not come back to play for the national team if the current leaders are still in place,"" the letter read.
Spain's governing sports body, the CSD, said on Friday it will request the suspension of Rubiales.
Victor Francos, who is the president of the CSD and the country's sports minister, said the government would ""initiate proceedings"" to require Rubiales to explain himself before a tribunal as soon as possible.

Rubiales would then be suspended if the administrative court finds that the controversial kiss, which Hermoso said was unwanted, violated the country's sports code.
""I think we can say it is the MeToo of Spanish football,"" Francos told journalists just hours after Rubiales announced he would not step down.
""There has to be a change. The government wants to warn, to be very clear and say that there are things that can't happen again,"" he added.
Spain's women's football league, Liga F, said it also lodged its own complaint with the CSD over Rubiales' ""very serious actions and behavior.""
""For a boss to grab his employee by the head and kiss her on the mouth simply cannot be tolerated,"" it said.
The controversy has also entered Spanish politics.
Rubiales was condemned by Spain's acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and several government ministers, some of whom Rubiales threatened to sue over their comments.

Instead, he surprised many by claiming that the pressure he has received this week from politicians and clubs was an attempt ""to publicly assassinate me"" and said he would defend himself by ""taking action"" against those people.
The RFEF president said his kiss on Hermoso's lips was ""consensual"" and done in the same spirit as kissing his child.
""It was a spontaneous kiss, mutual, euphoric, and consensual,"" he said.
However, that's not how Hermoso saw it. On Wednesday, she issued a joint statement with the Spanish players' union, FUTPRO, which called for action to be taken against the RFEF president.
""We are working to ensure that acts such as those we have seen never go unpunished, that they are sanctioned and that the exemplary measures are adopted to protect women footballers from actions that we believe are unacceptable,"" the statement said.
On Thursday, football's global governing body upped the pressure on the Spanish football boss by announcing that its disciplinary committee had opened proceedings against him. 
In a statement, FIFA said the incident ""may constitute violations of article 13, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the FIFA disciplinary code.""
Article 13 deals with the ""offensive behavior"" of players and officials, particularly in terms of ""violating the basic rules of decent conduct"" and ""behaving in a way that brings the sport into disrepute.""
""FIFA reiterates its unwavering commitment to respecting the integrity of all individuals and strongly condemns any behavior to the contrary,"" it added.
FIFA has not said when the disciplinary committee could be expected to issue a decision on the matter.
The incident happened as the Spanish team had assembled on the podium to receive their winner's medals and congratulations from FIFA President Gianni Infantino, Spain's Queen Letizia and Rubiales.
The RFEF president kissed Hermoso on the cheek, then he grabbed the head of the 33-year-old and pressed a kiss onto her mouth.
Minutes earlier, Rubiales, who watched the match from the VIP section of the stadium, was seen in video footage grabbing his crotch in an apparent gesture of victory.
In Friday's speech, Rubiales apologized for making that gesture, saying it had happened in a moment of ""euphoria"" and was directed towards Spain coach Jorge Vilda on the touchline.
The kissing incident has overshadowed Spain's 1-0 victory over England, which made the country just the second after Germany to have won both the men's and the women's World Cups.

https://www.dw.com/en/gabon-election-ali-bongo-hoped-to-extend-familys-55-year-rule/a-66618057,POLITICS,Gabon election: Ali Bongo hoped to extend family's 55-year rule 25.08.2023,"Gabon went to the polls on Saturday, August 26, to vote in presidential, legislative and local elections.
President Ali Bongo was favored to win a third term. He has ruled the oil-rich Central African country since winning elections after his father, Omar Bongo, died in 2009.
While 18 other presidential candidates were approved to run, the opposition alliance Alternance 2023 announced last week that it would support a joint candidate to avoid splitting the opposition vote and end the Bongo family's 56-year rule.
The six groupings that comprise the alliance said they would withdraw their candidates in favor of 69-year-old Albert Ondo Ossa, an economist and former education minister under Omar Bongo.
""Personally, I am for change, and that is why on the 26th I am going to vote for Mr. Ondo Ossa so that there is a change, so that we can put an end to this corrupt system,"" student Jordan Massalla told AFP news agency at an Alternance 2023 rally on Sunday.
Bongo controversially won the 2016 election by just a few thousand votes — despite monitors finding apparent anomalies. His victory triggered clashes between opposition supporters and security forces, resulting in several deaths and injuries.
""We must have elections without death,"" Ondo Ossa said in a speech on the weekend. ""Gabon and the Gabonese people have paid with their blood. It's now or never, we must manage the country differently.""
Bongo, who has the backing of the ruling Parti Democratique Gabonais (PDG) founded by his father, was tipped to win Saturday's election — although the lack of opinion polls this year makes it difficult to gauge his actual level of support.
""He's going to win, he's put Gabonese people to work, he's reduced unemployment, he can win, because he's developing our country, Gabon,"" Olivier Mbango, a young student, told DW.
On the campaign trail, Bongo promised higher family subsidies and cuts to public school fees. But his detractors say he has done little in his 14 years as president to funnel the country's oil wealth to ordinary people.
As one of Africa's top oil producers, Gabon has a higher GDP per capita than many other nations in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite this, more than a third of its 2.4 million people live below the poverty line, with unemployment at 37%.
The opposition has also questioned the fitness of the 64-year-old president after he had a heart attack in 2018 and wasn't seen publicly for nearly a year afterward. He still has a stiff arm and leg but appeared strong while campaigning.
""There's no question that Ali Bongo would be declared the winner,"" said Gyldas Ofoulhast-Othamot, a political scientist at St. Petersburg College in the United States. ""But being declared the winner and actually winning is two different things.""
Gabon's election process is far from free and fair, with the country only gaining two out of 40 possible points for political freedom in Freedom House's latest report.
Ali Bongo's power has weakened compared to that of his father, Omar, but he still has a firm grip on state institutions, maintaining political dominance through a combination of patronage and repression.
During his 41 years in power, Omar Bongo became notorious for raiding his country's resource wealth to amass a fortune that included some 40 luxury properties in France, 66 bank accounts and over 180 cars, including a Bugatti sports model that cost $1.5 million (€1.38 million). To give an idea of his vast wealth, the former president moved $100 million in funds through a single New York Citibank account from 2003 to 2007.
The Bongo family members number in their hundreds (Omar Bongo sired at least 50 children) and they occupy key posts in the government and the economy.
Last-minute changes to the voting process were also expected to help the incumbent to victory.
The Gabonese Election Centre, the body in charge of elections, introduced a single ballot paper to vote for all three elections on Saturday.
The single ballot grouped presidential, legislative and local candidates from the same party together. It meant that when someone voted for a member of parliament from a particular party, for example, they automatically also voted for that party's presidential candidate.
This put independent candidates, such as the main opposition's candidate, Albert Ondo Ossa, at a disadvantage. To get around this, the opposition is urging people to only vote for presidential and local elections and boycott the parliamentary vote.
While the opposition is furious about the change, ordinary Gabonese in the capital Libreville also seem confounded.
""I don't know why everything is being changed at the last minute. With the elections coming up, are our grandparents going to understand all these new things?"" one woman complained to DW.

https://www.dw.com/en/fifa-launches-proceedings-against-spanish-fa-boss/a-66622553,SOCCER,FIFA launches proceedings against Spanish FA boss 24.08.2023,"Football's global governing body, FIFA, announced on Thursday that its disciplinary committee had opened proceedings against Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) President Luis Rubiales.
The move comes amid outrage over Rubiales forcibly kissing Spanish player Jenni Hermoso on the lips following last Sunday's World Cup final.
In a statement, FIFA said the incident ""may constitute violations of article 13, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the FIFA disciplinary code.""
Article 13 deals with the ""offensive behavior"" of players and officials, particularly in terms of ""violating the basic rules of decent conduct"" and ""behaving in a way that brings the sport into disrepute.""
""FIFA reiterates its unwavering commitment to respecting the integrity of all individuals and strongly condemns any behavior to the contrary,"" the statement added.
The incident happened as the Spanish team had assembled on the podium to receive their winner's medals and congratulations from FIFA President Gianni Infantino, Spain's Queen Letizia and Rubiales.
The RFEF president kissed Hermoso on the cheek, then he grabbed the head of the 33-year-old and pressed a kiss onto her mouth.
Minutes earlier, Rubiales, who watched the match from the VIP section of the stadium, was seen in video footage grabbing his crotch in an apparent gesture of victory.
FIFA has given no indication of when its disciplinary committee can be expected to hand down a ruling.
The global soccer governing body's move is just the latest development in a story that has overshadowed Spain's first Women's World Cup title.
On Wednesday, Hermoso issued a joint statement with the Spanish players' union, FUTPRO, which called for action to be taken against the RFEF president.
""We are working to ensure that acts such as those we have seen never go unpunished, that they are sanctioned and that the exemplary measures are adopted to protect women footballers from actions that we believe are unacceptable,"" it said.
For his part, Rubiales initially rebuffed the many critics of his conduct, who have included Spanish politicians, including the acting prime minister. However, he later apologized in a video statement issued by the RFEF.
Meanwhile, the RFEF has launched its own investigation into the incident and said it had called an ""extraordinary assembly"" for Friday.

https://www.dw.com/en/the-bundesliga-how-it-all-started-6-decades-ago/a-66599558,SOCCER,The Bundesliga: How it all started 6 decades ago 24.08.2023,"The first games were played on Saturday, August 24, 1963 — all eight games. No Friday, Sunday, or (God forbid) Monday fixtures. The decision to establish a single top-tier league of 16 clubs in West Germany had been made at a national congress of the German Football Association (DFB) held in Dortmund in July 1962.
""This decision makes me happy. At last, we have it,"" West Germany coach Sepp Herberger, who had been a congress delegate representing the Southwest German Football Association, said at the time according to the DFB Journal.
This made West Germany one of the last major European countries to get a single top-tier league. England's Football League, which became the Premier League in 1992, had already been founded long before, in 1892. Italy's Serie A kicked off its first campaign in 1898, Spain's Primera Division in 1929, and France's Ligue 1 followed in 1932. Even the ""other"" Germany was far quicker to establish a top tier league than West Germany: The Oberliga began play in 1949, before the state of East Germany had even been officially founded.
Many had grown tired of a rather cumbersome system that the DFB had used to determine Germany's football champion since 1903. Under that system, the champions of the regional leagues (at first eight, later 16) would face each other in a knockout tournament to determine the national champion.
The disadvantage to this system, though, was that it meant the country's top teams in any given era or season would only face each other once a year. Many also argued that a single top-tier national league running over an entire season was a fairer way to determine a champion, rather than a two-legged knockout tournament — in which, in theory at least, a lesser team could win the title by hitting a strong run of form at just the right time. The Bundesliga would change all of that.
Clubs had to apply to the DFB for admission to the Bundesliga for its inaugural season. A total of 46 of the 74 clubs in West Germany's top regional leagues (Oberliga) did so. The DFB had predetermined a system meant to distribute the teams over the entire country: Three would come from the north, five each from the west and south, two from the southwest and one from West Berlin.
The selection, which was made by a five-member Bundesliga commission, was based on sporting, economic and technical criteria. A major factor was a club's performance in the Oberliga over the previous 12 seasons. While several clubs were named to join this new league without dispute, several others were cause for considerable controversy. Much of the reason for this was that the commission didn't always strictly follow its own criteria in determining which clubs to invite.
To smooth things over with some of those who were excluded, the idea of increasing the number of teams in the inaugural season to 18 or even 20 was raised, but ultimately rejected. A total of 13 of the clubs that didn't make the final cut lodged protests with the DFB — all of which were unsuccessful. It may seem hard to imagine in 2023, but among these were a certain Bayern Munich.
The founding members of the Bundesliga were: Hamburg, Werder Bremen and Eintracht Braunschweig from the north; Eintracht Frankfurt, Karlsruhe, Nuremberg, 1860 Munich and VfB Stuttgart from the south, Borussia Dortmund, Cologne, Meidericher SV (better known as Duisburg), Preussen Münster and Schalke from the west. Kaiserslautern and Saarbrücken were admitted from the southwest; Hertha were chosen to represent West Berlin — a decision made more for political than for footballing reasons. The honor of becoming the Bundesliga's first champions went to Cologne.
The next major change came in 1991: Germany's reunification led to an effort to integrate East German football into a united league system. As a result, the last East German Oberliga champions, Hansa Rostock, joined the Bundesliga for the 1991-92 season, along with second-placed Dynamo Dresden — with the league expanding to 20 teams for a single campaign. At the end of the season, four were relegated — including Hansa Rostock — and just two promoted from the second tier, bringing the Bundesliga back to 18 clubs.
1. Today's perennial champions Bayern Munich didn't join this exclusive club until 1965, when the Bundesliga expanded to 18 teams.
2. The last remaining founding member of the Bundesliga, Hamburg, were relegated for the first time in 2018 — after 55 years of uninterrupted membership.
3. Bayern Munich and Werder Bremen are the two clubs that have spent longer in the league than any other, with both embarking on their 59th Bundesliga season — in the league's 61st.

https://www.dw.com/en/zimbabwe-election-why-the-youth-vote-matters/a-66592088,POLITICS,Zimbabwe election: Why the youth vote matters 22.08.2023,"Jamaican dancehall blares out of speakers across Zimbabwe as the longtime ruling ZANU-PF party and the leading opposition party, the new Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), try to attract the most crucial voters in this year's presidential election — the youth.
The music has not only become the unofficial soundtrack of Zimbabwe's presidential election but is also very much loved by the youngest voters, who could change the outcome of the election just by casting their ballots on Wednesday.
One of them is Anyway Manhenga. ""I would like to vote for someone who ensures that there is medication in hospitals, road rehabilitation and someone who stabilizes prices of commodities,"" the 34-year-old told DW.
In addition to playing local versions of Jamaican dancehall music and fielding young candidates in contests for parliament and councils, parties have also been actively using social media. There, they've been posting videos featuring pop stars or inviting famous sports personalities like former world boxing champion Floyd Mayweather who attended a ZANU PF political campaign event.
""This year's election will most likely be decided by youths, given the majority of voters are between 26 and 35,"" Babra Ontibile Bhebe, executive director of the Election Resource Center, told DW. 

The leading presidential candidates, incumbent President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the CCC's candidate Nelson Chamisa, are battling to convince Zimbabwe's largest demography that their party is better than the other. Zimbabwe is dealing with significant challenges, such as youth unemployment, limited access to education, human rights violations, mental health issues and rising living costs.
Harrington Chawonza, another young Zimbabwean, said he also believes that a change in leadership is the only way forward. ""I am going to vote for a young person who can well represent us,"" Chawonza told DW, adding that he expects the next president to change his life by creating jobs. ""At the moment, I am just hustling.""
About 6.5 million out of an estimated 15.5 million people have registered to vote in Zimbabwe's ninth election since the country gained independence from Great Britain in 1980. One-sixth of the registered voters are first-time voters. And therefore, their votes are more than crucial. They can now pick their president from one of the 11 candidates.
While many young Zimbabweans put their faith in opposition leader Nelson Chamisa to usher in a better future, the CCC has struggled to establish its candidates in rural areas that are traditional ZANU PF strongholds. Farai Muroiwa Marapira, director of information and publicity at ZANU PF, said he is optimistic the ruling party will win the youth vote.
""The youth has been a major part of the ZANU PF campaigns from participating in our primary elections,"" Marapira told DW. ""We have a lot of youth vying to represent ZANU PF and I believe a lot of youths were actually representing the party at ward and parliamentary elections,"" Marapira said, stressing that their political rallies had seen massive youth attendance. 
Generational differences have defined the election campaign. 80-year-old President Mnangagwa is the older of the two main candidates. In addition, ZANU PF also celebrates its 60th founding anniversary in August. The party, long associated with the late President Robert Mugabe, has used the occasion to recall its origins as an anti-colonial liberation movement and denounce the opposition as Western puppets.
According to Farai Muroiwa Marapira, the party attracts a lot of interest from the youth.
""More than 50% of attendance at the end of the rally was mostly the youth,"" Marapira noted, adding that they are quite happy and hope to continue attracting more youth because the policies of the president [Mnagangwa] that are youth and gender-centered. ""The results are there for all to see. The youths are very much a part of ZANU PF, which is a progressive party.""
Also hoping to clinch the youth vote is the CCC, which promises new beginnings. Forty-five-year-old Chamisa, a charismatic lawyer and pastor, is much more approachable for many young Zimbabweans.
""We are very much impressed by the participation of younger people in our party and our country's politics,"" 30-year-old Gift Ostallos Siziba, the CCC's spokesperson, told DW. ""Those between the ages of 18 and 35 are the major victims of the political crisis in our country, which has moved into an economic crisis."" Siziba described the life young people in Zimbabwe as a life with ""empty stomachs and a jobless existence.""
According to official figures, Zimbabwe's youths constitute about 68% of the country's population and about 75% of the voters. In addition, about 70% of Zimbabwe's youths are unemployed. Siziba told DW that ""the solution in our country is to vote for the 'president' [Chamisa].""
According to Siziba, CCC encourages youth to participate in politics actively.
""Look at the positions of parliament members in Harare, Bulawayo and different parts of the province Manicaland. You see the representation of women and young people,"" Siziba said. ""Those were central philosophical state points for the CCC, so we are doing all so that we become a home for the younger people, a home for the oppressed who are in the center of the national democratic project we are executing.""
According to Bhebe, the youth rarely has a chance to participate in politics. ""The number of youth contesting in the 2023 elections is very low largely because they were sidelined and in some instances elbowed out by senior political party members,"" the human rights and governance expert said.
""The presidential age limit is clearly stated in the constitution and for that to be changed to accommodate youths with a desire to run for the presidency at a much younger age, then a law reform would be essential. But as long as the youth are sidelined in policy making and governance, their voices will continue to be muzzled,"" she explained.
However, some of the young voters have complained that they've received unsolicited calls and messages encouraging them to vote for the ruling party. Many don't believe that the election will be free and fair, as many votes in the past were marred by systematic violence and voter intimidation.

https://www.dw.com/en/gamescom-2023-bigger-and-more-international/a-66590606,SOCIETY,Gamescom 2023: Bigger and more international 22.08.2023,"Gamescom, the largest video games trade fair in the world by its own account, opens its doors in Cologne on Wednesday. More than 1,220 exhibitors from 63 countries will show their new products over the next five days. Hundreds of thousands of gamers will patiently join long lines to spend 15 minutes at a time trying out games scheduled to be released in the coming months. It will be loud and crowded in the Cologne exhibition halls when the international gaming industry comes together.
""This year more than ever, Gamescom is a reflection of the global gaming culture: dynamic, international, creative, diverse and huge,"" boasts Felix Falk in a press release. He's the managing director of the German Games Industry Association, which co-organizes the trade fair.
But it wasn't a foregone conclusion that Gamescom would even take place at all this year. The E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) in Los Angeles, for decades the most important trade fair for video games, has not returned after the COVID-19 pandemic forced cancellations.
That's in part because, during the pandemic, many games companies experimented with presenting their new titles through live streams. In the meantime, streaming formats such as Nintendo Direct, State of Play, Xbox Games Showcase, State of Unreal or Ubisoft Forward have become well established. So developers and publishers are no longer dependent on in-person events to stay relevant. By partnering with streamers, they can reach their target audience directly — and at a considerably lower expense than when they travel around the world to trade fairs with a bunch of people and purpose-built demo versions. It's perhaps no wonder that big names like Sony Interactive Entertainment (makers of Playstation), Electronic Arts (""EA Sports FC 24""), Epic Games (""Fortnite""), Take Two (""Grand Theft Auto"") or Activision Blizzard (""Call of Duty"") have chosen to skip this year's Gamescom.
For the first time ever, a South American country is the official partner country of Gamescom. Brazil's gaming industry has grown considerably in recent years, and it has concentrated mostly on the PC and mobile games market. More than 1,000 games studios are now located in Brazil, in contrast to the 133 companies in 2014. Some 13,200 people are employed in the sector in Brazil, and are increasingly producing for the international market, which is made affordable by digital distribution channels.
According to the ""Brazil: Game Industry Report 2022,"" fewer than half of the studios in the country receives state support. Many games are financed by the founders themselves, with help from their friends and family and individual investors. The result is that, so far, none of the really big games has come from what is the fifth largest country in the world. Developing so-called AAA  games — the blockbusters of the gaming world, like ""Elden Ring"" or "" Hogwarts Legacy "" — can cost at least $100 million (€91 million).
But the Brazilian studios don't have anywhere near that kind of budget. So the country produces mostly indie games, rendered in pixel graphics or a comic-book style. The Brazilian delegation to Gamescom is made up of almost 60 studios, which are bringing titles from various genres, including horror games, rhythm games, role-playing games, 2D jump-and-runs, and the cute cozy game ""Gaucho and the Grassland,"" a farm simulation game. 
That's likely to appeal to gamers in Germany, where simulator games have a dedicated fanbase. The game called ""Farming Simulator"" is once again present at Gamescom with an extensive exhibition stand. Major exhibitors like Bandai Namco Entertainment (""Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon,"" ""Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections""), Microsoft (""Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty,"" ""Forza Motorsport,"" ""Immortals of Aveum,"" ""Payday 3,"" ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2,"" ""Starfield"") and Nintendo (""Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown"") are among those offering a preview of their upcoming releases.
Indie games are developed by smaller studios that work independently of big companies. It can be worthwhile visiting the Indie Arena Booth, where visitors can try out international indie games and chat directly with the developers. The mood is friendly, and gamers are often surprised by the creativity of the smaller studios.
The Retro Area at Gamescom offers gamers a chance to take a deep dive into the history of video games and play vintage titles like ""Pacman."" Cosplayers have a special village just for them, and organizers have also announced an e-sports tournament.
On the eve of the first day of Gamescom, Opening Night Live (ONL) traditionally takes place, hosted by Canadian video game journalist and founder of the Game Awards, Geoff Keighley, and featuring trailer and gameplay reveals as well as developer talks. 
German Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck will officially open Gamescom. His ministry is responsible for state funding of digital games and also organizes the German Computer Game Prize. Computer game promotion is a big issue in Germany because the gaming industry here lags behind the US, Canada and France. It's no coincidence that Germany does not produce AAA games. Federal funding of €50 million ($55 million) per year has been available since 2020, but that's not enough. Currently, no further federal funding is available to the industry. High labor costs, a high tax burden and a shortage of game developers — just under 12,000 people work in the gaming industry in Germany — make it difficult for studios to keep up with global competition.
But Gamescom offers German studios a good opportunity to present their games to an international audience. Despite the lack of really big games from Germany, there are still remarkable smaller titles that are appreciated worldwide. The pirate adventure ""Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew"" from the makers of ""Desperados 3"" could become another insider tip, or ""The Darkest Files,"" a detective game where players solve crimes from the Nazi era.

https://www.dw.com/en/world-cup-hermoso-demands-consequences-over-unsolicited-kiss/a-66589820,SOCCER,World Cup: Hermoso demands consequences over unsolicited kiss 21.08.2023,"Days after Spain's women won the World Cup for the first time in their history, all the talk continues to be about what happened at the award ceremony. When Jenni Hermoso, Spain's No. 10, stepped up to the podium to receive her winner's medal and congratulations from FIFA President Gianni Infantino, Spain's Queen Leticia and Luis Rubiales, the president of the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), Rubiales kissed her on the cheek. But then he grabbed the head of the 33-year-old and pressed a kiss on her mouth.
""What was I supposed to do? I didn't like it,"" Hermoso said during a post-match livestream.
Her reaction was mild in comparison to those of some others.
""It should not be assumed that kissing without consent is something that just happens,"" Spain's equality minister, Irene Montero wrote on X.
""It is a form of sexual violence that we women suffer every day and that has been invisible until now and we must not normalize it.""
Spanish Minister of Social Rights Ione Belarra was equally critical on the social media platform.
""We're all thinking, if they do this in front of all of Spain, what won't they do in private? Sexual violence against women must end.""
Now, having had a few days to reflect upon what happened, Hermoso has issued a joint statement with the players' union Futpro in which she said the incident must have consequences for Rubiales. She and the union called on the RFEF to ""establish the necessary protocols, protect the rights of our female players and take exemplary measures.""
The union said it rejected ""any attitude or behavior that violates the rights of female football players.""
Futpro, it said, was committed to ensuring that such actions ""never go unpunished, that they are sanctioned and that the appropriate measures are taken to protect female footballers from actions that we consider unacceptable.""
On Wednesday, the RFEF announced that it had launched an internal investigation into Sunday's events and would hold an ""Extraordinary General Assembly"" on Friday.
""Surely I was wrong, I have to admit,"" Rubiales said in a video statement issued by the RFEF on Monday. ""It was without bad faith at a time of maximum effusiveness.""
Rubiales has come under fire over the incident, including from acting prime minister, Pedro Sanchez.
""What we saw is unacceptable,"" Sanchez said. ""And the apologies offered by Mr. Rubiales are not sufficient, I would call them inappropriate, so he must continue taking further steps to clarify what we all saw.""
In the immediate aftermath of the incident, Rubiales had appeared to wonder what all the fuss was about.
""The kiss with Jenni? There are idiots everywhere. When two people share an unimportant gesture of mutual affection with each other, you can't pay attention to the crap that's being said,"" the RFEF boss told Radio Marca.
This also came after he had reportedly told the players in the dressing room that he was going to send the entire team to Ibiza as a reward for winning the World Cup title.
""In Ibiza we will then celebrate the wedding of Jenni and Luis Rubiales,"" he reportedly said.
This is not the first time Rubiales, who last year vehemently backed national team coach Jorge Vildas in the face of a revolt by more than a dozen players, has been the subject of controversy.
Last year, Spanish media reported that he had allegedly held a party in early 2020 to which 8-10 women were invited. The reports alleged that the party wound up being an orgy and Rubiales subsequently billed it as a work event. Both the RFEF and its boss have denied the allegations.
Rubiales' post-match actions have wound up overshadowing a sporting success no one would have thought possible just nine months ago. This is because by the end of September 2022, there was essentially no team left, after 15 players temporarily quit the national team in protest. The reason they gave was their ""emotional and therefore (overall) health,"" which made it impossible for them to participate in the national team's games until ""the situation"" was corrected.
At the time, the main reason was apparently coach Jorge Vilda. The players who revolted accused him of failing to respect their privacy, ignoring the reserve players, and in general not creating a professional environment around the national team. A public dispute ensued with the RFEF, which supported Vilda and threatened the renegade players.
Despite the first World Cup title, it was clear on Sunday that a rift still runs through the team. While the players on the pitch formed a red jubilant cluster, a second crowd of euphoric people jumped up and down in front of the bench, separated from the first.
Still, joy prevailed. Spain, which has already amassed an impressive collection of junior international titles in recent years, is now the first nation in the world after Germany to win both the men's and the women's World Cups.
""It was so hard, we tried to imagine it, but you can't imagine something like that. And now we are world champions. It's incredible,"" a teary-eyed Hermoso told German public broadcaster ZDF.
Little did she know she was about to unwillingly become a central figure in an incident that would overshadow this sporting success for days and maybe even weeks to come.
This article, which was adapted from German, was updated after the apology of Luis Rubiales, as well as after the announcement about the RFEF Extraordinary General Assembly, the response by Prime Minister Sanchez and the statement of Jenni Hermoso and her union.",Sports
https://www.dw.com/en/beyond-fame-the-art-of-the-stars-at-d%C3%BCsseldorf-show/a-66587873,ARTS,'Beyond Fame' — The art of the stars at Düsseldorf show 21.08.2023,"For the exhibition ""Beyond Fame. The Art of the Stars"" at the NRW-Forum in Düsseldorf, curator Alain Bieber has selected artworks by 18 celebrities. On show are photos, paintings, drawings and sculptures. The mix of genres is as varied as the range of artistic personalities, which includes musicians, actors, writers, sports stars and politicans.
How did he come up with the idea for the show? ""We thought it was exciting to see all the people who were involved with art,"" Bieber told DW. He admits that, with celebrities, making visual art is often a marketing stunt. ""Ed Sheeran did an action painting once, and Britney Spears once did some flower paintings while wearing a bikini, he pointed out. For ""Beyond Fame,"" however, he says he chose people who take art seriously.
He says there are ""big surprises"" among them — works by German singer Tim Bendzko, for example, or even former tennis pro Michael Stich, that have never been shown in a museum before. ""You wouldn't think they'd paint like that."" None of the selected artists had ever attended an art academy, he said. ""We want to leave judgment of the works to our audience,"" Bieber says. ""We're excited to see the reactions.""
""We cultivate Joseph Beuys' expanded concept of art here,"" explains Bieber, ""which asserts that everyone is an artist."" One example, he says, is former Wimbledon champion Stich. After retiring from tennis, he took up painting as a hobby, studied art history for two semesters and set up a studio. Stich said it took him 10 years before he went public with his paintings. ""My art is a reflection of my personality and my emotions,"" as the exhibition organizers quote the former tennis pro.
The paths the selected personalities have taken to artistic expression are as varied as the people themselves are. And their choice of artistic medium is sometimes surprising. Some works are closely linked to their respective biographies. Some artists are at home in several creative fields at once. One of them is the German theater actress, author and visual artist Lea Drager. She draws images of popes, male and female, with which she questions patriarchal systems and hierarchical structures. Fellow German actress Meret Becker is active as a singer, actress and visual artist. Her work deals with social issues and she also campaigns for women's rights.
Musicians like Bryan Adams and Peter Doherty have sold millions of albums — and they've been creating visual art for many years. ""Good photographs are like time capsules that store memories,"" Adams told the Düsseldorf museum. Doherty, the scandal-ridden singer of British band The Libertines, sees art — along with poetry — as ""an expressive way to process his life."" He works with blood and charcoal, combining drawing, painting, sculpture and collages of images and text.
The works by Canadian musician Claire Elise Boucher, aka Grimes, are populated by the kinds of fantasy figures — nymphs, cyborgs and manga characters — that she also portrays herself as in her music videos. According to the museum, she draws inspiration for her drawings and album covers from mythical and psychedelic images, borrowing figures and motifs from Art Nouveau and Surrealism, and has recently begun using artificial intelligence.
Whether as a counterbalance or a complement, people in politics also engage in artistic activities. For example, German Green Party politician Anton Hofreiter makes no secret of his enthusiasm for
nature. He earned a PhD in botany at the start of his political career, and he paints and draws flowers. For him, as the museum says, this is ""a way of recognizing how things really are.""
""Beyond Fame"" promises to arouse curiosity about little-known facets of prominent contemporaries. ""Some of our artists,"" promises curator Bieber, ""should soon be on view in other museums."" For the time being, the artistic director of the NRW-Forum is banking on the ""Barbie"" effect: ""Whether you love Barbie or not — you simply have to have seen the latest movie!""
The exhibition ""Beyond Fame. The Art of the Stars"" at the NRW-Forum runs until January 24, 2024.

https://www.dw.com/en/world-cup-wiegman-remains-key-as-female-coaches-stall/a-66581288,SOCCER,World Cup: Wiegman remains key as female coaches stall 21.08.2023,"Of her many qualities, it is Sarina Wiegman's constant composure that stands out. Even as her England side suffered defeat in the 2023 World Cup final, just as her Netherlands' team had four years earlier, she stayed calm, strolling across the pitch to her crushed players before heading to the Spain bench to congratulate the winners.
""She's given us the confidence to believe in ourselves and a lot of calmness in situations where we've been put under pressure,"" England defender Lucy Bronze explained to DW. 
Though she has fallen short on the global stage, Wiegman has won the last two European Championships, with England in 2022 and her native Netherlands in 2017. 
But it's not just success that makes Wiegman an outlier. She was the only female coach to make the quarterfinals of this tournament and one of only 12 that started it. That is a figure higher than 2019 (nine) and 2015 (eight), though both of those World Cups had eight fewer teams. The ratio of female to male coaches is not changing much.
""It would be nice if the balance gets better, and we need to work to make it better. UEFA doing that, FIFA doing that, federations need to do that and also give women opportunities,"" she said, in answer to a DW question after the 2023 final in Sydney. 
Jill Ellis, who won the previous two tournaments with the USA, agrees. She told DW that such discrepancies are the result of opportunity deficit.
""I think women can execute at the top level. I think what you're seeing, in terms of the numbers, is we've got to continue to create and invest in opportunities. We can't assign a head coach just because she's a female, we have to make sure that there's support around or that she's educated to be ready for that position when it arrives,"" she said.
The success of coaches like Wiegman and Ellis has, so far, not led to female coaches taking charge of prominent men's sides in the same way men often coach women. While Wiegman's links with the England men's job seem speculative for now, Ellis said it's only a matter of time until that changes.
""I don't think it's far away at all,"" she continued. ""We've seen it in the US in other sports. We've had assistant coaches in NFL [American Football], Major League Baseball, NBA [Basketball]. I think it should be almost genderless if you're a good coach, you're a good coach. It's about the grassroots. In the US, for example, we hardly have any females on the sidelines of the youth.
""I think it's because it's a tough environment. Parents are hard in there, sometimes, criticizing. People sometimes think that a great coach is someone screaming and yelling, because they're doing something. And so I don't think we see females in that area, and then therefore, they're not cutting their teeth at an early age.""
While this World Cup and last year's EUROs in England have seen the profile of the game skyrocket, and participation numbers soar among girls, those changes don't appear to quite be filtering through to coaches. A FIFA survey in 2019 found more than 13 million girls and women played the sport, but only 7% of coaches worldwide were women.
""It helps to see women on the stage, both on and off the pitch because what you can see, you can be,” said Wiegman in her pre-final press conference.
""Of course what we hope is to get more female football coaches at the top level and the balance gets better than it is right now,"" she had said earlier in the knockout stages. ""Of course males are welcome too. There are lots of males who have done a very good job in the women's game, but if the balance is better that will also inspire other women to start coaching.""
Though FIFA have not always been quick to grow the women's game, Ellis pointed to a program from world football's governing body that mandates there must be a female coach or assistant at youth World Cups. It is too early to judge the success of that. But there are still gender-based obstacles even for those who navigate the complex path to the top dugouts, like Chelsea coach Emma Hayes.
""You're going to be held to the highest expectations. It's not good enough just to win, it has to look perfect in almost everything,"" Hayes, who has won dozens of trophies with the English club and was named FIFA's Best Coach in 2021, told a panel at an event in Sydney shortly before the World Cup final.
""Maybe I've just come to accept that scrutiny over the years, and with age, it's got easier,"" continued. ""When I think about being a head coach, when I was in Chicago Red Stars [2008-10], these were the days when Twitter first started and I was overwhelmed with that. Early on in my career, I struggled with it. Now I just have processes in place. Clear Rules, I won't read social media for one reason, and that is that I think is important to protect your own confidence.""
Wiegman's confidence is unlikely to have taken too much of a dent in Australia, and neither has her reputation. She will no doubt be an inspiration to many, but it's clear there is still plenty of work to do.
""It is still necessary to do more to get more females involved,"" Wiegman concluded. ""I hope everyone has seen again that women and girls are inspired that they can coach or play."" She is not alone in that hope.

https://www.dw.com/en/world-cup-spains-centurions-realize-long-held-dreams/a-66581324,SOCCER,World Cup: Spain's centurions realize long held dreams 20.08.2023,"Spain's three most senior players, Alexia Putellas, Jennifer Hermoso and Irene Paredes may have worried that their chance of winning the World Cup would pass them by.
The trio, the only female players to have won more than 100 caps for La Roja, endured challenging build-ups to the tournament with their participation in the competition in Australia and New Zealand touch-and-go up right until the final moment.
Putellas' return from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury she suffered in July 2022, was understandably far from smooth, as she struggled to regain the form that won her back-to-back Ballon d'Ors.
Meanwhile, defender Paredes, though not one of the 15 players to write an email to the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) calling for the conditions under head coach Jorge Vilda to improve, voiced her support for the players actions on social media and relinquished her international captaincy role in the process.
And, with Hermoso having left Barcelona after falling out of love with football there were doubts from the player that it would be a feeling that would ever return, let alone allow her to be in the mental space to play the sport at the highest level on the global stage.
Despite all the hurdles the three players had to overcome, they sit on top of the world with World Cup winners medals — a thought that seemed impossible just a few months ago.
""We tried for so many days to imagine what it is like to be world champions but we couldn't,"" Hermoso said after the final whistle. ""It is difficult to describe. it is a huge joy. I am so proud of this team. We showed that can fight as well and suffer.""
As a woman of few words who trapses through mixed zones offering nothing more than a brief smile to journalists, Putellas far preferred to have her efforts on the pitch do her talking.
Although many felt the team's chances leading into the World Cup hinged on their taliswoman's return and skill, with fans believed Putellas' return to the team was far more important than the rest of the 15 players who were out in the cold.
""Alexia and I have played together for so long,"" Hermoso told DW about her former Barcelona teammate. ""To be living in this moment with one another, it is so special.""
The 29-year-old proved to only make a minimal impact and spending so little time on the field during the World Cup was a difficult pill to swallow for a player that is obsessively strict with her own exceptionally high standards.
Putellas made no effort to hide her frustrations during the tournament from the sidelines, throwing a water bottle centimeters away from the bench, after being substituted in the 46th minutes against Zambia.
Prior to her injury, the dynamic midfielder played like the ball was glued to her boots, but the technically gifted individual, having had to re-learn how to walk, run and control the ball, spent most of the tournament struggling to keep up with the pace of the game and unable to provide the pinpoint accuracy so accustomed to her, to release Hermoso or Paralluelo.
But, the leader within her saw her constantly corral and encourage her team, something all the players craved, according to Hermoso.
""We know how special Alexia is, how special she is for the team and how special this win is for her,"" she explained.
For Hermoso, playing at the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand seemed impossible just 12 months ago.
Despite, being Barcelona's all-time leading goalscorer, having netted 181 times in 224 appearances, she found herself searching for a way out from the team she has supported since childhood.
At the end of the 2021-22 season, following a tumultuous season off the pitch with the Barcelona fans directing much vitriol towards her, the forward moved to Mexican club Pachuca on a free transfer.
""The road to this point was really hard,"" Hermoso told DW through tears. ""I had to go to Mexico just feel like a player again. To bring back my love and passion for football.""

""So many people in Spain were talking and still talk about me, who I am, how I play. I've demonstrated to those people that even though I am 33 years old, I am still capable of being a good player.""
Head coach Vilda kept his faith in Hermoso to be adaptable between leading the line for La Roja and dropping into midfield to accommodate teenager Salma Paralluelo, who was name Young Player of the Tournament.
""Jenni had a lot of responsibility on her shoulders,"" Vilda said. ""I have known Jenni for more than 15 years, she came here as the best version of her, she has given everything she can at 33 years of age, and I am so proud of her.""
Vilda's decision paid off as Hermoso, who is also Spain's all-time leading goalscorer with 51 goals, scored three times during the tournament and set-up Paralluelo's winning goal against 2019 finalists Holland in their tightly-fought 2-1 extra time win.
""Life is composed of moments,"" Hermoso reflected. ""There was a moment where I had to leave the best team in the whole world. This moment now, it is the one I have been waiting for, for so long.""
At 32, Paredes also knew to lift a trophy with Spain time was not in her favor, and she faced a difficult decision when the RFEF came out in support of Vilda as opposed to the players who had expressed concerns.
Despite the Barcelona captain not being one those to send an email, her inclusion in the side was unclear, having made herself unavailable for selection until April 2023.
For Vilda, the experienced center-back's reintroduction into the team was one that required little thought.
When asked about Paredes return after Spain's friendly against China in April, he told DW: ""She is a great player and has been for a long time, of course I am very happy to have her with us. We do not think about the past.""
Paredes was the only outfield player to play every minute of the World Cup, and it was her calm head, decisiveness in the air and robustness against striker's that helped her marshal Spain's back line.
""It is a dream,"" Paredes told DW. ""It’s been very hard but we knew it was possible. These moments are historic for Spanish football. It's difficult to put it into words but it means everything.""

https://www.dw.com/en/bonmati-inspires-spain-to-their-first-womens-world-cup/a-66581239,SOCCER,Bonmati inspires Spain to their first women's World Cup 20.08.2023,"Aitana Bonmati wasn’t even expected to play at this World Cup. But she now stands as a World Cup winner, Golden Ball recipient, and likely soon-to-be-crowned best player in the world.
The midfielder was at her crafty best as Spain defeated England 1-0 in the final.
""I don’t have any words for this moment, it’s unbelievable,"" a stunned Bonmati told the BBC. ""I'm so proud because we played a great tournament. We suffered but also we enjoyed it. We deserve it.""
""Everyone knew the goal during our preparations at the beginning of the tournament. Everyone in the squad is competitive and has a strong mentality to win. We have been working for many years for this moment and we have it. We have the trophy.""
In a match that was always going to shift and sway in the midfield, Bonmati led the way as Spain suffocated and nullified England for much of the 90 minutes. 
It’s been a breakout tournament for the 25-year-old, who’s usurped Alexia Putellas as Spain’s most influential player.
There’s good reason why Pep Guardiola said he was ""completely in love with her for the way she plays"".
All eyes pre-game were on Spain’s counterparts, particularly Bonmati’s Barcelona teammates Keira Walsh and Lucy Bronze.
This was England’s final. Euros winners from 2022, bronze medalists from the last two World Cups in 2015 and 2019. Heavy investment in the women’s game has been paying off with the Women's Super League exploding and muscling its way ahead of other nations' leagues.
But Bonmati wasn’t so prepared to allow England that kind of dominance in this final.
The opening 20 minutes saw chances fall to both sides, with England’s Lauren Hemp stinging the post and Salma Paralluelo scuffing her lines from just a few yards out.
But as Bronze galloped upfield into a wall of Spanish defenders on the half-hour mark, La Roja hit with clinical precision.
Mariona Caldentey played a perfect ball into the onrushing left-back and captain Olga Carmona, allowing her to hit a perfect first-time effort past Mary Earps for her third goal of the tournament.

Thereafter, Spain suffocated the the first half, shutting down Walsh’s options moving forward and forcing England into hopeful forays on the wings.
“We had all studied the English team and it was the game of our lives,"" Carmona said. ""We managed to neutralise very good players from England. We won this game on our merit, not because England did not play well.”
Bonmati grew up in a coastal town south of Barcelona and was born into a family that instilled in her a rebellious nature from birth.
Spanish children are given both parents’ last names and Bonmati’s family wanted to break away from norms and attempted to list her mother’s last name first.
They fought against the long-held rule of prioritising the father’s name, and won.
She told the Players' Tribune before the World Cup that she had a willingness to fight for women's rights ""in her blood"".
It’s what fueled her fight for her and her teammates' rights against the Spanish FA and coach Jorge Vilda in 2022, when 15 players went on strike in an attempt to instigate change.
She was vilified in parts of the press and missed out on precious minutes with her nation but she was passionate about the Spanish FA needing to ""invest more in us"".
In the end, she put aidse her grievances to return to the national setup, intent to prove herself on the international level after a stellar season for Barcelona.
Bonmati enhanced her reputation across the past 12 months, winning the Liga F and Champions League for Barca, before scoring three goals and two assists at the World Cup.
Her performances have prompted praise from the highest quarters, with Guardiola labeling her the female Andres Iniesta, and Xaxi saying “gets me off my seat, that’s the reason people are so passionate about this sport”.
England coach Sarina Wiegman rang the changes at halftime as she attempted to get Walsh involved, with Lauren James and Chloe Kelly introduced to the game.
It changed the dynamic in midfield slightly as England tried to force Spain on the backfoot.
""The first half we didn’t have our best game, we just couldn’t get near them. But the second half I think changing the shape was much better,"" Millie Bright said.
""You know, winning the duels, being aggressive, putting them on the backfoot. But it’s small margins in football and this shows how cruel it can be.""
Despite the improvements from England tactically, Spain adapted to the changes and still continued to forge the better chances, with Earps forced into a superb right-hand save across her body to deny Caldentey in the 50th minute.
Spain were then gifted an opportune chance to put the game to bed in the 70th minute when VAR awarded a penalty for a handball in the box from Walsh. Jenni Hermoso’s poor effort was covered by Earps, however, forcing Spain to find another way to close down the game.
With Bonmati stationed firmly in midfield alongside Teresa Abelleira and Hermoso, an organized unit forced the clock down with every trick they could find, frustrating England and the majority of the white-and-red-clad crowd.
""We knew their qualities but we have a very good team. That’s why we’ve been doing a lot of work and we were confident in ourselves. And finally we showed the world how we can play,"" Irene Paredes said.
When the final whistle sounded, Bonmati fell into the arms of Caldentey, the realisation of the moment hitting her. And as she climbed onto the stage to receive her Golden Ball award as best player of the tournament, Bonmati completed her transformation from rebel instigator to World Cup hero.

https://www.dw.com/en/world-cup-matildas-on-field-legacy-must-be-matched-off-it/a-66570609,SOCCER,World Cup: Matildas' on-field legacy must be matched off it 19.08.2023,"""I want them talking about our f**king game. I want them talking about us.""
Those were the words of then-Australian men's coach Ange Postecoglou back in 2017, addressing his squad ahead of the Confederations Cup.
Years, decades, a century of football being trampled upon and ignored in Australia fed into the passion behind that speech.
And now, thanks to the Matildas, the Australian women's team, a whole nation has finally woken up. It's been a long time coming, but the 2023 World Cup has enraptured Australia with football like never before.
Ticket sales have exceeded expectations, while more than 7 million Aussies tuned in for their team's semifinal loss against England.
While this achievement is an astonishing success, given the game's historical struggle to make in-roads in the wider Australian public, the work has only just begun.
""If you look at the numbers, football's not been getting its fair share,"" vice-captain Steph Catley told DW.
""There are so many young girls and boys that want to be playing and that need the funding and need the resources to get to the top level and do amazing things for our country and football. It can't stop here. It's ready to take off.""
Now that the Matildas have done their job on the pitch, the onus is on politicians, administrators and the corporate world to ensure a legacy exists long after the excitement of a World Cup diminishes.
It's 6 a.m. on a Friday morning in Newcastle, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) north of Sydney, one of Australia's historic football strongholds.
The morning light is only just slicing through the darkness as the magpies break the silence. A stream of girls slowly arrive at the academy facilities of A-League club the Newcastle Jets, not a yawn in sight, just ready to get down to work.
Matildas star Emily van Egmond followed the exact same path before making her debut for the club aged just 15. Early morning sessions, school, evening homework and long drives around the state of New South Wales for games on the weekends.
Since English and Scottish migrants working in the coal industry introduced the game in the late 1800s, football has been ingrained in this town, strengthened further by migrants from Italy, Macedonia, Greece and other European nations.
But even here, the game has always been in the shadow of other sports. Football, despite boasting the highest participation rates in Australia, has been chronically underfunded and ignored when compared to other sports.
""It's still a long way behind in regards to the funding that goes into rugby league,"" the Jets' girls academy director Ryan Campbell told DW.
""Considering all the numbers we have in football, especially with female football on the rise, we're really being left behind in regards to funding, infrastructure and facilities.""
While other sports such as rugby league and Australian rules football receive heavy subsidies, soccer clubs are forced to pass the operating costs onto parents. It's AUD$2,700 (€1.588, $1.724) a season to sign up for the Jets' academy programmes.
But Campbell believes hosting the 2023 World Cup, and the Matildas' run to the semifinals, could be the catalyst for real change.
""Riding this wave is going to be really important. Everyone has really got behind this World Cup, they're talking about all the games, not just Matildas games,"" he said.
""Hopefully that will get governments on board to get behind football.""
Van Egmond was a key part of the Matildas' success at the World Cup, starting four games and scoring one goal. She's won the fourth-most caps for Australia and been to four World Cups.
For Jets academy player Isabella Walshe, 15, seeing Van Egmond and the Matildas unite Australia at this World Cup has been a game-changing experience.
""It's such a big inspiration, it's been really exciting. I expected a large amount [to be watching] but not half the country,"" she said.
""It's a big thing for the nation. I reckon it'll go further and improve and that it can beat the other sports and be a big thing in the future.""
The Newcastle Jets are one of only a few A-League clubs with a girls academy, a strong indication of the obstacles facing the game in Australia. At least at the Jets, the girls have access to the same conditions as the boys.
The country's top tier, the A-League Women, is slowly creeping towards professional standards, but the minimum wage is still just $25,000, forcing players into second jobs, while crowds only average about 1,250.
""Officially it's a professional league, but the funding and the wages don't justify it being a professional job. Hopefully from this World Cup, people jump in and want to support these players,” Campbell said.
""It needs to take that next step so all players can concentrate 12 months a year on football as their job.”
Many politicians have attempted to jump on the bandwagon and cash in on the popularity surge, including Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who recently promised $200 million for women's sport after the Matildas' success. A pledge specifically for football, however, wasn't forthcoming.
Soccer supported women's sport long before other codes, with the W-League set up in 2008. Rugby league only introduced a women's comp in 2018, while Australian rules football followed in 2019.
The big test now for soccer advocates is to hold the government accountable and ex-Socceroo Craig Foster is particularly determined to keep up the pressure.
""Every MP who's held up a 'go Matildas' sign or put out a tweet saying 'Tillies till I die', there's receipts and I've tucked them all away, and I'll be coming for you in the future, because there's a price to pay when you're doing that,"" Foster told The Canberra Times.
Star forward Sam Kerr has also added her voice to the wall of noise calling for meaningful change, saying ""we need funding everywhere"".
""We talked about this before the World Cup that we want to leave a legacy and have this moment talked about for 10, 20 years,"" she said.
""It really feels like we've brought the nation together over football.""
Kerr and her teammates have done exactly that, they've kick-started something special. The country is talking about the Matildas, they're talking about their game. And now it's time for the powers-that-be to deliver on their end of the bargain.

https://www.dw.com/en/world-cup-increasing-knowledge-about-menstruation-to-keep-girls-in-the-game-longer/a-66545480,SPORTS,World Cup: Increasing knowledge about menstruation to keep girls in the game longer 17.08.2023,"One of the most likely ways for a youngster to fall in love with football is to witness breathtaking and spectacular moments up close.
This is why a key argument for bringing the Women's World Cup to the Southern Hemisphere was to give just such an opportunity to young girls who are usually deprived of seeing their idols in the flesh.
As parents in Auckland and Wellington have told DW on numerous occasions throughout the monthlong tournament, there is no shortage of football-mad children in New Zealand, with football arguably the most popular sport among the country's youngsters.
While a future generation of New Zealand internationals may well have just witnessed their first live matches on the global stage, keeping them in the sport long enough to reach similar heights poses one of the greatest challenges to the game here.
There is an alarming drop-off as girls progress through the age groups, and a lack of understanding around menstruation among female athletes has been highlighted as one of the main reasons for the diminishing numbers.
""It's critical that we empower young girls that want to be athletes,"" Clare Morgan, CEO of Organic Initiative which supplies sustainable biodegradable period products, told DW.
""You don't want anxiety around a period to put them off sport. It's hard enough to keep women in sport at the best of times and anything we can do to encourage women to stay in sport is a huge legacy that we can leave,"" she said.
As one of the nine host cities of the tournament in Australia and New Zealand, Auckland sought to address this issue before the World Cup began, aiming to create an everlasting legacy.
In June, Tataki Auckland Unlimited, the region’s economic and cultural agency, organized a youth symposium for 14–18-year-olds focused on educating young female and male football players on menstruation and the effects it can have on athletes' bodies.
Taelor Pickering-Parker was signed on to help coordinate between an advisory board for the symposium and the speakers for the event.
The head coach of the Papakura women's and the Maori women's teams was an avid football player herself, but began coaching at the age of just 16. 
It gave Pickering-Parker a unique perspective on trying to play football while menstruating and trying to coach her own set of young girls.
""We see that the rates of participation further down in the age groups in football suffer a steep decline,"" the 25-year-old told DW. ""It was important to ask the question: 'Does menstruation have an impact on that decrease?'""
Equally, as a Maori, she was aware that menstruation is a particular barrier to Maori and Pasifika women and girls participating in education and physical activity.


""Menstruation is not something I have ever been open about in terms of my own experience. I also lacked knowledge about it, in terms of facts and these barriers were spoken about at the symposium,"" she said.
""I don't even speak about it with my own family, let alone strangers, so it was a bit awkward. It was a nerve-wracking experience, especially having males in the room too.""
Although it may have been a personal challenge to speak and listen openly about such a taboo subject, Pickering-Parker praised the symposium for offering a welcoming and understanding space for the girls and boys who attended.
She said that as a coach of menstruating girls, the information she heard from the various speakers helped her become a better and more empathetic coach.
""It's a lot easier being a female coach to understand because I can relate to this issue personally,"" said Pickering-Parker. ""I've had many male coaches and the conversation is something that is misunderstood.
""Once I learned more from the symposium, it made me a lot kinder to the players and myself because now I know a little more deeply why things are happening in players' bodies and minds.
""As a coach I feel I have a lot more in my toolbox now. Just learning that a lot of female injuries happen around menstruation, because of the loss of blood for example. It validates how I felt as a player and now as a coach, it helps me support my players through that time.""
Jayda Scanlan is one of players coached by Pickering-Parker, for both the Papakura women's and the Maori women's team.
The 14-year-old agreed to be on a 10-person advisory board for the youth symposium, offering her own input on the areas the speakers would address.
Research company Honoco reported that young Maori and Pasifika Aucklanders are 63.6% more likely not to play a sport they are interested in because clothing or equipment makes them feel self-conscious.
""Trying to have the symposium remove the stigma around periods was important to me,"" Scanlan told DW. "" It's not a gender-neutral topic, it's mainly focussed on girls and it can be uncomfortable for boys to talk about it.
""We really tried to help the speakers include both a female and male point of view so the boys could feel included and also understand the various topics more than it just being about periods and specifically personal for girls.""

The symposium also gave the teenager the confidence within herself to accept differences she now faces as athlete as she is going through menstruation.
After the event, Tataki Auckland Unlimited reported that 88.3% of participants felt more confident to speak to others about periods, something Scanlan could not have imagined before.
""As an athlete I would turn up to training and games with low energy and motivation due to periods,"" she admitted. ""After the symposium, I felt far more supported knowing other people also experience the symptoms I am getting while playing competitive sport.
""I feel more confident in myself to talk to my coach and my teammates, even if it's just to ask if anyone has any spare products or being able to say 'I am on my cycle can you watch out for me a little.'
""It is something that helped me come out of my shell a little bit more and to be able to talk to my teammates and my coach about what I'm going through at that time.""
As World Cup legacy's go, this may well have been one of the most important in safeguarding and enriching future generations of the Football Ferns.

""Among the hundreds of early European people who lived at the same time as Ötzi and whose genomes are now available, Ötzi's genome has more ancestry in common with early Anatolian farmers than any of his European counterparts,"" the scientists said in the study, published Wednesday in the journal Cell Genomics.
Ötzi's body was discovered in 1991 by two German hikers on a glacier in Italy's Southern Tyrol. His body was remarkably well preserved due to the cold and a natural mummification process.
Ötzi died around the age of 45. He was approximately 1.60 meters (5 foot 4 inches) tall and weighed roughly 50 kilograms (110 pounds). He also had brown eyes and sported over 60 tattoos.
Ever since his discovery more than 30 years ago, he has been a fascinating source of information for historians and anthropologists. Ötzi was armed with a copper ax and a longbow and wore a bearskin hat. Scientists have been able to conclude that he had a big meal of ibex meat and fat not long before his death, and that he died after being shot with an arrow between his rib cage and shoulder blade.
Researchers also believe the ancient man was suffering from stress, dental cavities, and lactose intolerance. More than likely, Ötzi also struggled with Lyme disease and a stomach infection.

But the latest DNA results provide new insights, forcing scientists to revise their findings about some of the most fundamental aspects of Ötzi the Iceman — his ancestry and appearance.
Initial DNA analysis had earlier indicated Ötzi was related to eastern European steppe herders of his day. But it now appears that original sample was contaminated by modern genetic material. The study published Wednesday suggests Ötzi had no traces of the eastern European tribes.
Johannes Krause, head of the Department of Archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, said his team was ""very surprised"" by the results.
""Genetically, his ancestors seem to have arrived directly from Anatolia without mixing with hunter gatherer groups,"" he said.
The researchers also deduced that Ötzi was bald, or almost bald, when he died. This was genetic, as his genes show a ""predisposition for baldness,"" the study said.
The team also concluded that the Iceman was darker-skinned than initially thought. In life, his original skin color was likely similar to his body's present color.
Scientists previously believed the Iceman was lighter-skinned and hairier, and that his mummified corpse had changed over time in the ice.

https://www.dw.com/en/tony-gustavsson-cements-his-place-in-matildas-history/a-66552092,SOCCER,Tony Gustavsson cements his place in Matildas history 16.08.2023,"The many faces of Tony Gustavsson tell the story of a football match better than any match commentator. He rides the highs with pure joy and the lows hit him like a brick to the face.
The Swede is not just a coach for the Matildas; he's their biggest fan, a fervent motivator, a human being who allows his players to be themselves.
Gustavsson has a quirky streak to him, he's a people person who wants to be liked. Thoughtful, courteous and fiercely loyal to his players.
""He's so passionate and he loves this team like his family. I've never seen anything like it from a coach, he genuinely feels everything that we feel,"" vice-captain Steph Catley told DW.
""I can't speak highly enough of him, he's been incredible. He's led us brilliantly, led us bravely and just believed in us from the very beginning.""
Selfless and humble can be added to the 50-year-old's list of traits. He's often repeated that he's simply a cog within a bigger team.
When DW asked him earlier in the tournament whether he was bothered that the players get all the plaudits when Australia wins, while he takes the flak when they lose, he was resolute.
""I can take the hits. The role of any coach is to take the hits when the team has them,"" he said. ""Nothing is about me, it's all about the players. I will always be there to protect them, whatever they need. It's my job.""
Gustavsson entered Australian football in September 2020, his first head coaching gig in international football after being an assistant under Jill Ellis when she led the United States to the 2015 and 2019 World Cup titles.
In his first press conference as head coach of Australia, Gustavsson said ""passion, love and joy"" fueled his football journey and he targeted World Cup glory even then, saying ""I wouldn't be here if I didn't think it was possible.""
The Matildas ultimately fell short of that dream, losing 3-1 to England in the semifinal, but their performances, attitude and relatability have elevated football's standing in the country.
On the pitch, Gustavsson addressed a dearth of squad depth, a somewhat fractured team culture and underperformance against the world's best teams.
Gustavsson mapped out an ambitious plan that held risks and opened the coach and the team up to brutal scrutiny. He insisted that the Matildas had to test themselves against the world's best to create a competitive environment within the squad.
This resulted in some ugly results, like when inexperienced side was thrashed 7-0 by Spain in June 2022. That followed a disastrous Asian Cup campaign in January, when Australia were knocked out in the quarterfinals of a tournament they expected to win.
""Everyone's gotten behind him. And over the last couple of years we've had our ups and down, but we kind of peaked at the right time [for the World Cup],"" Australia forward Mary Fowler said.
""It's nice to see how far the team's come, we have a lot to be proud of.""
The high-octane, attack-minded football Gustavsson promised didn't always eventuate, most recently in an underwhelming first half against England, but he did give the team a platform to foster an unwavering team spirit.
""We've had coaches in the past who haven't really understood our passion and our love for this team. And that our Australian culture is a big part of what we do out on the field and they've kind of tried to change us,"" Catley said.
""He came in and adopted who we were as people and players and embraced it and loved it. He bought into what we were doing and (we) then brought in his ideas and his football brain. He's been awesome.""
The likes of Fowler, Kyra Cooney-Cross and Clare Hunt were blooded into the squad under Gustavsson and the trio are expected to form the spine of the team for the next decade.
Gustavsson has never really had it easy with the Australian public and press. He's ridden through a fair share of calls for his head, most recently after the 3-2 loss to Nigeria in the group stages.
Defensive fragility, poor game management, and a lack of a meaningful Plan B were the oft-repeated criticisms, and not without reason.
He was handed the keys to a home World Cup, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Australian football. He would have rightly been pilloried for an early exit, but he leaves the tournament having played a major role in this team's legacy.
He delivered on many promises – mainly increasing the Matildas' player pool, getting more talented youngsters their first caps, and making Australia competitive against the best. They beat England, France, Spain and Sweden in the seven months leading up to the World Cup.
Now, the onus is on the administrators, the Australian government and the corporate world to back up those on-pitch performances, and help ensure the Matildas' on-field legacy is matched by meaningful change off it.
""I've said before it's bigger than 90 minutes of football. It's emotional to sit here and talk about when we've lost a semifinal. I hate to lose,"" Gustavsson said after the England loss.
""But hopefully we won something else. We won the heart and passion for this game in this country. This is not the end of something, it needs to be the start of something.
""We have to keep working and growing the game together. Let's invest more and be genuine contenders for medals and tournaments moving forward.""
Gustavsson loves referencing inspirational quotes and sage pieces of advice from former mentors. But his personal mantra is his most repeated: ""one day better.""
""I want to get better every day, not just one day older. I sit here one day older, but hopefully one day better as well,"" he said.
He enters the World Cup third-place playoff having taken charge of 41 matches, with 19 wins, 6 draws and 16 losses. The last 13 of those victories came in the past 16 games.
His relentless quest for self-improvement has rubbed off on his players. The team epitomizes everything Australians love and respect in sporting teams: a never-say-die attitude, a willingness to do whatever it takes and, most importantly, an ability to beat the best.
The Matildas are the only team, and Tony Gustavsson the only coach, to defeat Sarina Wiegman's England. Despite falling to them at the World Cup, Gustavsson can be assured of a lasting legacy in Australian football. And he may get a chance for revenge at the Paris Olympics next summer.",Sports
https://www.dw.com/en/living-diversity-how-afro-germans-are-reaching-for-the-stars/a-65794265,POLITICS,Living diversity: How Afro-Germans are reaching for the stars 16.08.2023,"People with African roots are active across many professions in Germany: They may be working as shopkeepers, care workers, musicians and service providers. They are also increasingly represented in the media, at universities and other areas of public life.
But for some years now, they have also started taking a central place in politics.
""The presence of Black people is especially visible in politics. They stand for a society that is more diverse than it often is perceived,"" said Tahir Della, spokesman for Initiative of Black people in Germany (ISD).
In an interview, he told DW it's exciting to see people who grew up in Germany and who are part of all existing structures to also be represented this way.
The association, which dates back to 1985, estimates the number of people of African origin in Germany to stand at around 1.2 million. While this number may seem low at first glance, Della said it also means that they are not proportionally represented in society.
Joe Chialo is among those Black Germans who is making a name for himself following his election as Berlin's culture senator on April 27.
He knows the economic impact this particular industry has on Berlin, and is also aware of the responsibility that comes with it. ""I am fully aware that the outgoing senator for culture [Volker Lederer — Editor's note] is very popular here in the city, and that the coming years will be full of challenges,"" Chialo told the German press agency dpa.
Chialo was born in Bonn in 1970 to a Tanzanian diplomat family. He later attended a Catholic boarding school near Cologne with his brother.
However, the political career of the 52-year-old has included some unusual stops along the way. Chialo trained as an industrial cutter in a mill, studied history, politics and economics for a few semesters and then dropped out to follow his passion for music.
He joined the hard rock band Blue Manner Haze, which had several successes in the 1990s. Around the same time, he became a member of the Green Party.
Years later, he would switch sides and joined the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in 2016 — but only out of support for former Chancellor Angela Merkel's refugee policy.
Chialo became known nationwide when he was appointed to the ""future team"" of then-chancellor candidate Armin Laschet during the 2021 federal election. Laschet lost the election, and Chialo lost his chance for having an office in the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament.
However, in the greater scheme of things, this was only a minor setback for Chialo, who describes himself as ""Afropean.""
In fact, his fresh perspectives on many of the major contemporary issues have helped him gain a major following. From challenging European views on Africa to addressing the Catholic Church's handling of abuse cases and Germany's failure to manage its digital transformation, Chialo has attracted plenty of attention and is being watched left, right and center for his future political ambitions.
Della said Chialo is widely appreciated for his unique views, but stresses that whether he can cement a future as a solid force for change remains to be seen.
""From my point of view, it is to the credit of the younger Black movement that Black people are now increasingly participating in the political process, contributing their positions and thus also contributing to a society that is characterized by diversity and fairness,"" Della told DW.
Aminata Toure is also making strides in Germany's political classes. She's the first female, Black government minister in her home state of Schleswig-Holstein, heading the Ministry for Social Affairs, Youth, Family, Senior Citizens, Integration and Equality since mid-2022.
Toure was born in Neumünster in 1992, where she grew up at a refugee shelter. Her parents had left their home country Mali after a military coup in 1991. Toure was not even granted German citizenship until she was 13 years old.
Toure went on to study political science and French literature, later becoming involved with the Green Party.
In 2017, she joined the Schleswig-Holstein state parliament in Kiel, becoming deputy speaker just two years later — the youngest person ever to hold this office and the first Afro-German.
And then she made a splash appearing on the cover of the German Vogue magainze.
In an interview with the fashion magazine, Toure appeared confident, highlighting the importance of fighting against racism and supporting the integration of refugees.
She told the fashion and lifestyle magazine that political processes need to become more transparent to reach social groups that do not care about politics.
Della said Toure's story highlights how people of all colors can reach success and have the best qualifications in Germany. ""You can't deny that something has changed in the last 10 to 20 years"" with regards to racist attitudes in Germany, he said.
Stephanie Ann Jones, known as ""Steffi,"" is one of the most successful German soccer players.
The 2003 world champion and three-time European champion retired from her active career in 2007, which was followed by her appointment as president of the Organizing Committee of the 2011 Women's World Cup.
The daughter of an African American soldier and a German mother went on to become the national coach of the German national women's soccer team — a position she held from 2016 to 2018.
And then she decided to say goodbye to the beautiful game, launching a new career as an entrepreneur in the software industry.
However, despite her remarkable achievements, Jones, too, is familiar with casual racism. She has had to deal with insults being hurled at her on the soccer pitch.
Della said, however, that things have become easier for people of color in sports as well, where they can make a difference and leave a lasting legacy that outshines their successes on the field.

https://www.dw.com/en/england-spoil-kerrs-and-australias-world-cup-party/a-66546635,SOCCER,England spoil Kerr's and Australia's World Cup party 16.08.2023,"The noise, the hype, the billboards, the speculation. Then, finally, the goal. The eruption. The surge of collective belief pulled from the pit of doubt. It wasn't to last.
Sam Kerr may have finally marked her arrival to the World Cup party in the style to which we've become accustomed, but even her brilliant long-range equalizer wasn't enough to delay Australia's exit for long.
As Lauren Hemp slipped past Ellie Carpenter to restore England's lead eight minutes later, Kerr puffed out her cheeks on the halfway line. It was not to be the last time her face would betray her frustration, with two late missed chances punished by Alessia Russo, after stunning work from Hemp. As the final whistle blew, the Australian captain bent double, hands on her knees, the weight of a nation on her shoulders.
""That's usually my bread and butter,"" said Kerr of her missed opportunities. ""But unfortunately this World Cup hasn't gone as planned.""
Given her hard-running display and starting berth, it was almost possible to forget about Kerr's calf. The injury that dominated the opening weeks of the tournament had faded in significance as the Matildas blasted, cruised and then edged their way further than they'd ever been before.
But, as in the last round against Colombia and their army of fans, England were in no mood to lay out the drinks and nibbles for a Stadium Australia party.
""We're such an experienced squad,"" Hemp said, in response to a question from DW in the postmatch press conference. ""We faced part of that in the Colombia game, the fans were absolutely wild, they were unbelievable. I felt like the Australian fans were unbelievable again and it was a fantastic atmosphere. But even after Sam's goal, I feel like there was no fear in the squad. We weren't nervous, we just played our football. I think that showed the relentlessness inside the squad.""
And, for all the noise early on, Australia seemed in no real hurry to provide the entertainment. The hosts sat off England, allowing the European champions to dictate the tempo until their captain briefly set a new tone.
By that time, Ella Toone ensured England had something more concrete. Hemp and Russo kept a throw-in alive long enough for Toone to run onto the loose ball and slice a sweet strike home.
Given the impact of Lauren James earlier in the tournament, Toone would almost certainly have been starting this one on the bench, but for James' sending off against Nigeria. It isn't the first time Toone has made an impact as a replacement, scoring the opener in England's Euros final win from the bench with an equally memorable strike a year ago.
With three successive World Cup semifinals and that Euros win, as well as England's investment in women's football ― from grassroots through the Women's Super League (WSL) to the expensive appointment of coach Sarina Wiegman and a well-resourced senior team ― the foundations are well established. With Wiegman as their architect, England's house is looking well in order.
Australia will hope that this tournament, a success in every way, will enable them to follow suit.
""It's been amazing to see the reaction from the Australian public to what we've been doing,"" said Australia's Steph Catley. ""[Particularly] from where we've come from. You couldn't find a more appreciative group than us. It has been so special.""
Though in a better spot than many at this tournament, a crowded sporting landscape in Australia has often seen football pushed aside, with a domestic league that struggles to retain its best players ― a major challenge yet to be solved.
Important as it is, questions of legacy are for another day. For now, the players in green and gold are left with a mixture of pride and frustration that their opponents were, until recently, all too familiar with.
The optimists in the Sydney stands, Melbourne fan parks and Perth pubs will believe this team can improve. Others may struggle to see a better chance than a home tournament. Kerr, at the end, appeared to be in the latter camp.

https://www.dw.com/en/united-planned-greenwood-return-amid-fan-protests-reports/a-66546273,SOCCER,United planned Greenwood return amid fan protests: reports 16.08.2023,"Manchester United began the 2023-24 Premier League season with a narrow 1-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Old Trafford on Monday night, a match preceded by supporter protests against the potential return of striker Mason Greenwood.
Greenwood, 21, was arrested in January 2022 after an audio recording emerged on social media of an alleged sexual assault, accompanied by images and video footage of apparent injuries.
Following a police investigation, Greenwood was charged with attempted rape, controlling and coercive behavior and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, all of which the player denied.
In February 2023, the United Kingdom's Crown Prosecution Service dropped its case against him, saying that ""a combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction.""
Greenwood has been suspended by Manchester United since his arrest. The club has also been conducting its own internal investigation before deciding whether or not to allow him to return to the first team, for whom he scored 35 goals across two-and-a-half seasons from 2019 to 2022.
A decision was expected to have been made by the start of the new season and, as The Athletic reported on Wednesday, August 16, it was expected to be that Greenwood would be allowed to return.
According to The Athletic, the intended date for the announcement was to be Friday, August 4, and it was intended to involve a video in which United's chief executive, Richard Arnold, would explain the decision to both club employees and the general public.
Arnold was reportedly expected to explain that Greenwood would be brought back into the first-team set-up but would not be doing any work with the Manchester United Foundation, the club's charitable arm, in the short-to-medium term.
However, the announcement did not go ahead. 
Later on August 16, United made their first public statement on the issue, saying: ""The fact-finding phase of our investigation is now complete and we are in the final stages of making a decision on Mason's future. Contrary to media speculation, a decision has not yet been made and is currently the subject of intensive internal deliberation.""
The club also acknowledged ""strong opinions"" provoked by what it called ""partial evidence in the public domain,"" adding that its own investigation had ""drawn on extensive evidence and context not in the public domain.""
Finally, the club confirmed reports that its final decision would be ""communicated and explained to internal and external stakeholders"" - believed, according to widespread British media reports, to include major sponsors, the club's fan advisory board and its women's team, three of whom are currently representing England at the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.
Before and after England's quarterfinal win over Colombia, goalkeeper Mary Earps and midfielders Ella Toone and Katie Zelem were targeted on social media by apparent Manchester United fans petitioning them to support Greenwood's return.
On the ground in Manchester, however, other female supporters organized a demonstration ahead of the Wolves game behind a banner reading: ""Female fans demand no Greenwood return. End violence against women.""
""The message to Manchester United is: 'Think about what you're doing. History is going to judge you,'"" One of the organizers, who are all long-time United season ticket holders, told The News Movement outside Old Trafford.
""We feel that there is a lot at stake here. Footballers are huge role models for children and young people. Does Mason Greenwood deserve to earn a living? Yes. Should that be at Manchester United, where he's a role model to millions of children and young people across the world? Absolutely not.""
While other male fans agreed, one countered: ""The police have had a go, and the charges have been dropped, so, for me, nothing has happened, and there's no case to answer.""
To that argument, another protester, giving her name just as Em, told ""The News Agents"" podcast:
""A process is a process, and a contract is a contract, but, for me, this is not a contract issue; it's an ethics issue, a morality issue. If we want to move the sport forward in terms of proper respect for diversity and inclusion, then you have to take a more grown-up stance and back the supporters.""
Another protest organizer told The Athletic: ""This is a tipping point for the club. Are they going to side with commercialism and trophies and money? Or are they going to take the side of match-going fans, and the club being a social and community institution that we can be proud of and proud to have as part of our identity?""
The discrepancy between opinions voiced, often anonymously, online and those held by people on the ground is an increasingly common one in modern professional football.
Just in the last month in Germany, a section of Borussia Dortmund supporters raised objections to the signing of midfielder Felix Nmecha, who had drawn criticism for a series of homophobic social media posts.
But the issue is particularly acute in England's Premier League, where clubs make billions of dollars from global broadcast rights and sponsorship deals but still rely on local supporters to actually physically attend their matches in the cities where they are based.
A similar split can also be observed on issues such as kickoff times being scheduled particularly early or late to suit television audiences, the prospect of a European or even global Super League and, most acutely in the case of Manchester United in recent months, the issue of a potential sale of the club to Qatar.
""My primary sense is that, in Manchester, among those supporters who go to the games, people don't want [Greenwood] to play, but how that plays out on social media and across the rest of the world, I'm not too sure,"" summarized Em, who also called for more vocal support from United's male supporters.
""There is support, and there is vocal support,"" she said. ""As so often, it's women leading this, but I'd like to see more men be vocal about it. Some of them are, and we're grateful for that. But there's a lot of silent acceptance.""
With United's England internationals set to remain in Australia for the Women's World Cup final on August 20, a decision from the club on Greenwood in consultation with the women's team has been put back.
Indeed, with the England players then set to go on holiday, it's possible that an announcement won't be made until the September international break.
Either way, it is understood that, while the women's team and other stakeholders will be asked for their opinions, those opinions won't ultimately reflect the final decision, which will be made by chief executive Richard Arnold based on the outcome of the club's internal investigation.
Asked during United's preseason tour of the United States earlier this month, head coach Erik Ten Hag said: ""Of course, I have said my ideas and opinions, but it's a club decision. We all have to accept that.""
Potentially still short of a striker, despite the signing of Danish forward Rasmus Hojlund, it is understood that Ten Hag is open to the idea of Greenwood bolstering his squad's attacking options.
Further complicating matters is United's current financial situation. With the club having recently been fined €300,000 ($327,850) by the European governing body UEFA for what the club described as ""a minor break-even deficit"" during the four-year period 2019-2022, the return of a prolific young striker who is already contracted to the club has an obvious sporting and financial attraction.
The question being asked by those United supporters protesting outside Old Trafford is, therefore: what is more important?

https://www.dw.com/en/eu-lawmakers-want-anti-war-declaration-for-russian-and-belarusian-athletes/a-66540746,SPORTS,EU lawmakers want anti-war declaration for Russian and Belarusian athletes 15.08.2023,"A group of members of the European Parliament have called on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to introduce an anti-war declaration for Russians and Belarusians wanting to compete at next year's Paris Olympics.
The IOC says it is yet to decide whether athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus can participate in the Games, although it has recommended that international sports federations allow some to take part in Olympic qualifying events as neutrals, citing their human rights.
In a letter to the IOC's president, Thomas Bach, the MEPs demanded more clarity on the conditions for participation and suggested that Russian and Belarusian athletes should be required to sign a ""statutory"" document declaring their opposition to Russia's war in Ukraine.
""By signing, athletes would publicly condemn any aggression against any of the UN (United Nations) member states,"" the group of 39 MEPs wrote in the letter dated July 21.
Last month, with a year to go before the Paris Olympics, the IOC omitted Russia and Belarus from its official list of Games invitees, but the possibility remains for Russians and Belarusians to compete in the French capital as ""Individual Neutral Athletes.""
""Though we appreciate not sending official invitations to Russian and Belarusian athletes, it is simply not enough,"" the MEPs added. ""The IOC's efforts must go further and not settle on using neutral flags.""
In May, sports ministers from more than 30 countries raised concerns that the IOC's current recommendations — which exclude teams from Russia and Belarus, as well as anyone who has actively supported the war or who is contracted to the military — were open to exploitation.
""While some aspects (...) have been addressed by the IOC, there are substantial issues remaining, not least around military connections of athletes, state funding, the definition of what constitutes teams, and on enforcement mechanisms,"" the ministers said in a joint statement.
Signing an anti-war declaration would appear to be a no-go for Russia, with the country's sports minister threatening an all-out boycott of the Olympics if that were to be a requirement for participation.
""There is a red line: No one will sign any declarations to condemn the special military operation and so on,"" Oleg Matytsin, the sports minister, told Russia's parliament last month, in comments reported by the Russian state news agency TASS. ""Our athletes will not participate on such terms.""
However, the group of MEPs, made up of politicians from all the main parliamentary parties and from 15 countries including Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic, warned that the absence of a declaration could result in athletes being ""used by both regimes for propaganda purposes.""
""It is usual for dictators and authoritarian regimes to weaponise sport as an instrument of expanding their influence,"" the MEPs wrote. ""For Russia and the Putin regime, sport is primarily a political tool; this has been clearly demonstrated by the fact that Russia has a state-sponsored doping programme.
""Under the current conditions, the participation of Russia and Belarus, including the teams and support personnel representing these countries, is inadmissible while the aggression against Ukraine is ongoing.""
DW asked the IOC for comment on the letter but was referred to a Q&A document on the Olympics website, where the IOC labeled political interference in sport as ""deplorable"" and complained that its ""autonomy is being undermined by some governments.""
However, in their letter, the MEPs say that the organization should follow its own Olympic Charter, which aims to use sport to promote a peaceful society.
""The IOC thus has to take a clear stance in order not to distance itself from its own values and ignore tens of thousands of Ukrainian casualties, many of them innocent civilians, children but also athletes,"" the MEPs wrote.
""A decision of such importance cannot be simply devaluated by repeating the principle of 'political neutrality.'""

https://www.dw.com/en/womens-world-cup-sees-attendance-and-tv-rating-records-tumble/a-66503615,SOCCER,Women's World Cup sees attendance and TV-rating records tumble 13.08.2023,"The noise was immense. As Hannah Wilkinson netted the winner for New Zealand in the 2023 Women's World Cup opener against Norway, about 42,000 Kiwis went wild.
It was the biggest crowd to watch a football match in New Zealand, men's or women's, smashing the previous women's record by 26,000. A few hours later, Australia followed suit as almost 75,000 fans cheered on the Matildas' 1-0 win over Ireland.
Now, as the semifinals approach, ticket sales are expected to hit 1.98 million for the entire tournament, which would equate to an average of 31,000 fans attending each of the 64 matches.
That has easily eclipsed the previous record of 1.35 million at the 2015 World Cup in Canada, which averaged out to 26,000 fans per game. 
It should be noted, though, that in 2015 only 24 teams were involved, as opposed to the current 32. This means just 52 matches were played instead of the 64 at this year's tournament. Another factor that may have contributed to the higher numbers is the fact that this time there have been two host nations instead of one – even if New Zealand failed to get to the knockout stage.
Considering that the initial target was 1.3 million and later increased to 1.5 million, the attendance represents a massive success for the host nations. Football has simply exploded in Australia and New Zealand over the past month, and global interest has been equally impressive.
Australia may be a fanatical sporting nation, but soccer has always struggled for widespread attention against rugby and Australian rules football, which dominate the media headlines and TV ratings.
Yet the Matildas' round-of-16 match against Denmark reached 6.54 million people on the free-to-air Seven Network, more than the country's biggest showpieces in 2022: the National Rugby League and Australian Football League grand finales.
""It's been immense. It's so amazing to see all the support we have, whether that's in the stands, behind the TVs, at the live sites,"" Australian defender Ellie Carpenter told DW after the match. ""It's like an extra man when you're playing.""
That figure also didn't include viewers on the subscription streaming service Optus Sport, which holds rights to every single 2023 World Cup match.
Australia has shown that it is indeed a soccer nation. Almost 1.27 million tickets will have been sold in Australia alone, with an average crowd of almost 36,000 attending the 35 matches at an average stadium capacity of 93%.
""Home advantage, home crowd, they're boosting us through this tournament,"" winger Caitlin Foord said. ""All credit to them, being loud and being there for us.""
New Zealand fared a little less well statistically, with about 700,000 tickets sold at an average of 24,500 per match. 
Fixtures in Auckland and Wellington were very well attended, but the decision to hold matches in Dunedin, with a population of just 129,000, dragged the numbers down significantly. The stadium didn't reach 50% capacity across its six games, though it did sell out for New Zealand's draw with Switzerland.
Considering the nation's obsession with rugby, however, and its population of just five million, the numbers outperformed expectations, with the record for the largest crowd for a football match in the country being broken three times in Auckland.
""The noise was deafening,"" New Zealand co-captain Ria Percival told DW after the Football Ferns' opening day win over Norway. ""I've never heard anything like that, and I cannot believe so many people came to watch us play. It was amazing.""
Defender Claudia Bunge said: ""I never dreamed of playing in front of a sold-out crowd at Eden Park. I hope just being a part of this piece of history has inspired all the little girls watching in the stadiums or at home to go out and be a part of the next generation of the Ferns.""
Though the hosts failed to reach the knockout stages, New Zealanders continued to turn up in droves to matches, donning flags from the teams playing on the day.
""We had never watched women's football before,"" supporter Charlotte Scott told DW in Auckland. ""Now we've watched five games, and we wish it was more!
""We have loved the excitement, bright colors and songs that all the different fans have brought,"" Scott said. ""Even when it was a smaller crowd, you find a team like Zambia who had a singing section that just never stopped.""
Cynical suggestions that free tickets may have boosted numbers also hold no water, with just 20,000 given away across all four New Zealand cities.
TV ratings have been equally as impressive, especially with most of the matches being shown on Sky and only a handful being streamed for free on Stuff.nz.
More than 1 million people turned on the team's opener against Norway during the course of the match, more than any figure for a men's World Cup match on record.
There have been impressive numbers worldwide as well, especially considering that many games are outside traditional prime-time slots in many markets.
Despite a 5:00 a.m. start in the Eastern time zone of the United States, the USWNT's last-16 defeat on penalties to Sweden drew 2.52 million viewers on Fox, peaking at 4.07 million. Their four matches averaged 3.80m, up from their first four matches of the 2019 World Cup.
The United Kingdom recorded a peak audience of 5.2 million on BBC One for the knockout victory over Nigeria, which kicked off at 8:30 a.m. in Britain. There were an additional 2.6 million watching on streams.
Germany's ARD reported that 10.36 million people tuned in to watch the nation's defeat to Colombia in the group stage, the highest rating in the country for 2023. More than 9m Colombians watched their team's match against South Korea, a 300% increase of the previous record for a women's World Cup match.
Brazil's opening match against Panama delivered a combined audience of 13.9 million people on TV Globo and SporTV. About 4.58 million viewers watched China's opener against Denmark on CCTV5.
Considering the boom that women's football received following the 2022 European Championship in England, there were fears that the host countries' unsociable kickoff hours for many time zones could hamper interest.
Those concerns have been well and truly quashed, showing that the appetite for the women's game is following that for men's football.
FIFA has said the tournament is on target to reach an overall audience of two billion people worldwide, significantly up from the 1.19 billion the organization reported from the 2019 World Cup.
The quality on show has also been at a higher standard, even after the tournament increased from 24 to 32 teams, to allow budding nations a chance to test themselves against the very best.
Big scorelines have been few and far between, and many underdogs, such as Morocco, South Africa and Jamaica, produced upsets in the group stages. Not only is the level improving, but the gap between the top and the bottom is decreasing.
With four matches to go, the show isn't over yet.
While New Zealand have been knocked out, Australia still hold hopes to lift the trophy. If the Matildas were to make the final, TV viewership could even rival the eight million that tuned into Cathy Freeman's victory in the 400m at the Sydney Olympics in 2000.
""It's nice to see where the game's going here, how many girls and boys want to play football,"" Foord said. ""It's just nice to know the game's moving in the right direction.""

https://www.dw.com/en/the-most-anticipated-new-films-of-2024/a-67389113,FILM,The most anticipated new films of 2024 29.12.2023,"The dual Hollywood strikes — writers' and actors' — threw a wrench into the 2023 movie schedule. Many of the biggest and most-anticipated films were delayed, postponed or had their releases pushed to 2024.
But the wait is nearly over. The film famine of 2023 is set to give way to a feast for cinema fans, with a year jam-packed with blockbusters and hotly-anticipated art house dramas.
Here are some of the biggest, and best, films to watch out for in the coming year. 
The second half of Denis Villeneuve's ambitious adaptation of the Frank Herbert sci-fi classic was one of the biggest movies to get pushed into 2024 (it was originally scheduled for a holiday season release this year).
The wait has only increased expectation for the sequel, which will see Timothee Chalamet return as Paul Atreides, the messianic leader of the rebellious desert-dwelling Fremen, as he seeks revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. He's joined by Zendaya as Fremen warrior Chani, and an all-star cast that includes Florence Pugh, Lea Seydoux, Austin Butler and Christopher Walken. 
Bong Joon-ho's English-language follow-up to his Oscar-winning ""Parasite"" is a sci-fi movie adapted from Edward Ashton's 2022 novel ""Mickey7"" and stars Robert Pattinson, Steven Yeun, Naomi Ackie, Toni Collette and Mark Ruffalo.
The book follows the story of an ""expendable,"" a disposable employee sent on a human expedition whose mission is to colonize an ice world. If one cloned version of the employee dies, a new body is regenerated with most of his memories intact.
British actor Kingsley Ben-Adir, who wowed as Malcolm X in Regina King's 2020 directorial debut ""One Night in Miami"" (and played one of the Kens in ""Barbie"" this year), is set for a star-making performance as reggae legend Bob Marley in this musical biopic from ""King Richard"" director Reinaldo Marcus Green. 
Originally set to open the 2023 Venice Film Festival, ""Challengers"" is another movie whose premiere was delayed by the actors' strike.
The romantic drama from ""Call Me by Your Name"" director Luca Guadagnino stars Zendaya as Tashi, a one-time tennis star whose career was ended by a freak accident, and who remains bound by ties professional and romantic to her twin teen romances: husband and international tennis ace Art (Mike Faist) and comeback hopeful Patrick (Josh O'Connor).
Hollywood is going back to the well in 2024, with an almost unprecedented number of sequels, spinoffs, prequels and reboots of established franchises.
Sony's ever-expanding Spider-verse (that is, Spider-Man movies without Spider-Man) will see at least three new editions.
Aaron Taylor-Johnson jumps into the skin of one of the comic book's favorite villains, playing ""Kraven the Hunter"" in an origin-story movie from ""Triple Frontier"" director J.C. Chandor.
Dakota Johnson will suit up as ""Madame Web,"" a clairvoyant mutant who teams up with Spider-Woman (played by ""Euphoria"" and ""The White Lotus"" star Sydney Sweeney) in a new feature by British TV director S.J. Clarkson (""Succession,"" ""Jessica Jones"").
And Tom Hardy reprises his role as schleppy reporter Eddie Brock, unwilling host to man-eating alien Venom, in ""Venom 3,"" the latest in the surprisingly-successful comedy-horror Spidey spinoffs.
Fans of the Oscar-winning animated ""Spider-Verse"" features may have to wait a while longer. Sony has not confirmed whether the third entry in the franchise, ""Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse"" will come next year or in 2025.
Todd Phillips' hugely-successful R-rated take on the iconic Batman villain won the Golden Lion in Venice in 2019, and earned Joaquin Phoenix an Oscar for best actor.
The sequel will see Lady Gaga join the party as Joker's equally-manic love interest, Harley Quinn. Oh, and the new movie will be a musical. Yes, really.
After testing the audience's appetite for Marvel movies — the latest, Nia DaCosta's ""The Marvels"" disappointed at the box office — Disney is dialing back its superhero output, with just one big lycra-suited outing this year: ""Deadpool 3.""
The R-rated meta-movie will see the return of Ryan Reynolds as the motormouth mercenary famed for breaking the fourth wall and taking directly to the audience. He's joined by Hugh Jackman, who reprises his role as ""X-Men"" hero Wolverine, unsheathing the claws for (one expects) a final time. 
Two extremely long-in-coming sequels are set to hit theaters next year, as Tim Burton teams up once again with Michael Keaton to revive the pasty-faced prankster spirit Beetlejuice, the eponymous hero of 1988 cult comedy hit. Winona Ryder and Catherine O'Hara are also both on board to reprise their characters, Lydia and Delia Deetz. 
Russell Crowe, who will be seen playing a nasty dad in ""Kraven the Hunter,"" will not reenter the Colosseum for ""Gladiator 2,"" but director Ridley Scott is returning to ancient Rome with a much-anticipated sequel to the 2000 epic. ""Aftersun"" actor Paul Mescal stars in the feature set a quarter century after the original film. 
George Miller hasn't waited quite as long as Ridley Scott, but ""Mad Max"" fans have been jonesing for this fifth installment in his iconic post-apocalyptic franchise since its triumphant return with ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" in 2015.
The new film is a prequel to ""Fury Road,"" starring ""The Queen's Gambit"" actress Anya Taylor-Joy as a younger version of Imperator Furiosa, the war rig-driving, mechanical-limbed bodyguard played by Charlize Theron in ""Fury Road."" Chris Hemsworth, Tom Burke, Nathan Jones and Angus Sampson co-star.
Just as ""Max Max: Fury Road"" opened the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, ""Furiosa"" is also expected to premiere in Cannes this year. 
Action fans bid a sad goodbye to Keanu Reeves' ""John Wick"" this year with the fourth, and final, entry in Chad Stahelski's shoot-em-up franchise. But ""Blonde"" star Ana de Armas is looking to expand the John Wick universe with this spinoff tale, playing a female assassin in a story set between chapter 3 and 4 of the original movies (meaning Reeves' iconic character will return for a cameo). 
Warner Bros. is returning to the ""Lord of the Rings"" universe with this animated prequel film, exploring the backstory of Helm Hammerhand, the legendary king of a rider folk called the Rohan, with ""Succession"" star Brian Cox voicing Helm. 
A sequel of a very different sort is this update on the 2004 cult high-school comedy, which sees Tina Fey (who also wrote the original movie) adapt the stage musical version of the film, as well as reprising her role as world-weary calculus teacher Ms. Norbury. Angourie Rice plays new girl Cady Heron, while Renee Rapp takes on the role of head Mean Girl Regina George. 
These art house and independent features are among those generating the most buzz in 2024. 
Gothic moviemaker Robert Eggers, director of ""The Witch,"" ""The Lighthouse"" and ""The Northman,"" turns his dark lens on the original Dracula tale with this new adaptation of the creepy classic, first filmed by F.W. Murnau in 1922. Eggers' version will star Lily-Rose Depp, Willem Dafoe, Emma Corrin and Nicholas Hoult. 
German director Nora Fingscheidt (""System Breaker,"" Netflix's ""The Unforgivable"") teams up with ""Lady Bird"" star Saoirse Ronan for this adaptation of Amy Liptrot's memoir about a recovering alcoholic who returns to her home in Scotland's Orkney Islands, where she must confront her troubled past.
After exploring the teen years of Beatle-to-be John Lennon in 2009's ""Nowhere Boy,"" Sam Taylor-Johnson takes on another British pop music legend with this story of soul-singing star Amy Winehouse, whose tragic death in 2011 shocked the world.
Marisa Abela plays Winehouse in a film that is sure to stoke controversy but, for fans of music biopics, will be the must-see of 2024. 
Oscar-nominated documentarian RaMell Ross (""Hale County This Morning, This Evening"") makes his feature debut with this adaptation of Colson Whitehead's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. The film tells the story of two boys unjustly incarcerated in a violently cruel reform school in 1960s Florida, and is closely based on revelations about Florida's historic Dozier reform school. 
Produced by Brad Pitt's production company Plan B, makers of ""Moonlight"" and ""12 Years a Slave,"" ""The Nickel Boys"" is already a prime candidate for the 2025 Oscar race. 
All-ages entertainment is also set to pack the multiplexes in 2024. 
The fourth entry in the hit animated franchise returns the focus to Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), the one-time super-villain turned hero and super-dad. Plot details are still under wraps but expect plenty of gadgets, sight gags and Minions mania nonsense.
Pixar's 28th feature film is a science fiction adventure following the eponymous 11-year-old Elio who is inadvertently beamed up into space and mistaken by aliens to be Earth's ambassador.
After the mixed reception of ""Elemental,"" Pixar's last feature, the animated studio is looking to get back on top with this original tale from Adrian Molina, who co-directed 2017 Pixar hit ""Coco.""
The release of ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" in 2021 revived the 1980s sci-fi comedy franchise (after a less-successful female-driven reboot in 2016), setting the stage for this sequel. ""Afterlife"" stars Carrie Coon, McKenna Grace, Finn Wolfhard and Paul Rudd, joined by Kumail Nanjiani, and Patton Oswalt. Several actors from the original movies return, including Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts and Bill Murray.
The plot sees the ""Afterlife"" team return to where it all began, at the iconic New York City firehouse from the original ""Ghostbusters."" 
""Moonlight"" director Barry Jenkins takes on this lifelike computer-generated prequel to Disney's 1994 animated classic, which will explore the backstory of Simba's father, Mufasa, voiced by Aaron Pierre (""The Underground Railroad""). 
Eight years after the original ""Inside Out,"" Pixar goes back inside the mind of young Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), now a teenager heading off to college whose internal emotions are made up not just of fear, joy, anger, disgust and sadness, but also the newfound sense of anxiety.
Video game adaptations used to be considered box office poison, but the big-screen versions of Sega's legendary run-and-jump franchise continue to speed right along. This third installment sees the return of Ben Schwartz as the voice of Sonic, Colleen O'Shaughnessey as Tails, and Idris Elba as Knuckles. It's set for a holiday 2024 release.

https://www.dw.com/en/why-gustave-eiffels-name-remains-famous-100-years-after-his-death/a-67792788,CULTURE,Why Gustave Eiffel's name remains famous 100 years after his death 29.12.2023,"Leaving behind a legacy of 700 constructions in 30 countries, visionary French engineer Gustave Eiffel died 100 years ago, on December 27, 1923 in Paris, at the age of 91.
His name is of course most directly associated with the Eiffel Tower, built for the 1889 Universal Exposition in Paris. The landmark structure has since become the symbol of the French capital and one of the world's most-visited attractions.
It is only through a quirk of history, however, that the striking tower bears the name of Gustave Eiffel, or that it is even standing today.
The engineer was initially not enthusiastic about the structure designed by Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nougier, colleagues in his construction company, Compagnie des Etablissements Eiffel.
That's why Eiffel involved his chief architect, Stephen Sauvestre, in the planning. The number of floors were reduced from six to three, while Sauvestre changed the position of the foundations and added the striking round arch under the first platform.
Eiffel, Koechlin and Nougier jointly applied for a patent on the design principle. Eventually Eiffel bought the copyrights from his employees.
The structure was subsequently named Eiffel Tower. But it could also have been called the Koechlin & Nougier Tower or the Sauvestre Tower. Who remembers them today?
Critics initially disparaged the design as a ""tragic lamppost,"" a ""disgusting ink stain,"" or the ""disgrace of Paris.""
An open letter against the project was published in the magazine Les Temps on February 14, 1887.
""We, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate lovers of the still intact beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength and indignation in the name of misunderstood French taste, in the name of art and threatened French history, against the construction of the useless and monstrous Eiffel Tower,"" the letter stated.
Among the signatories were writers such as Guy de Maupassant, Leconte de Lisle, Charles Gounod and Alexandre Dumas. 
The latter criticized the ""dizzying ridiculousness"" of the tower, which would dominate the city like a ""gigantic black factory chimney"" and overwhelm the architecture with its ""barbaric mass.""
But the idea of the tower caught on and Eiffel was able to quickly realize the construction, which consisted of 18,000 individual parts.
He even took on a large part of the financing by securing the lucrative usage rights for 20 years. People's curiosity about the monumental half-timbered tower was huge from the start.
Eiffel, who was born in Dijon on December 15, 1832, perhaps inherited his business savy from his mother, Catherine Moneuse.
The daughter of a timber merchant, she had invested in the booming hard coal business and the family's wealth grew massively within a short period of time.
In 1856, Gustave entered the service of Charles Nepveu, a civil engineering contractor and by his mid-20s the young Eiffel was already the construction manager of one the largest construction sites in France, the Bordeaux railway bridge.
Things got off to a good start for Eiffel professionally, but he was still single in his 30s, and wrote to his mother that he needed ""a neat housewife who won't pester me too much."" His mother found a match for him: 17-year-old Marie Gaudelet, whom he soon married.
The young Eiffel's constructions were in demand everywhere. He soon built churches in the Philippines and Peru, the Western Railway Station in Budapest, bridges in Vietnam and the iron framework of the Statue of Liberty in New York.
The plan was to demolish the Eiffel Tower once Gustave Eiffel's 20-year permit to use the land had expired.
However, the engineer wanted to have his masterpiece preserved for posterity. Early on, he started searching for a scientific purpose for the tower that would justify its existence.
He set up a meteorological and an astronomical observation station, while scientific experiments were carried out there also.
In 1898, the first wireless telegraph connection was established between the Eiffel Tower and the Pantheon.
By 1910, no one would have even considered demolishing the Eiffel Tower. Eiffel's rights were renewed for decades. 
During the First World War, the French army used the Eiffel Tower as a strategic observation post.
And it remained standing despite being threatened during World War II: The Nazis decided not to blow up the tower in 1944 when their defeat became apparent.
After the Second World War, all sorts of athletes — mountaineers, motocross riders, mountain bikers, bungee jumpers, parachutists and even tightrope acrobats — found a way to integrate the striking tower into their stunts.
The Eiffel Tower is still a top tourist attraction in Paris today, but is now considered a ""rusty old lady.""
The 324-meter-high (1,063-feet) and 7,300-ton iron tower was not actually intended to last forever since initial plans were to have it dismantled.
According to research from 2022 by French magazine Marianne, corrosion is causing major damage to the tower that urgently needs an overhaul.
""We saw Notre Dame burning, will we see the Eiffel Tower collapse?” asked the article's author.

https://www.dw.com/en/50-french-stars-deplore-lynching-of-gerard-depardieu/a-67826617,CRIME,50 French stars deplore 'lynching' of Gerard Depardieu 26.12.2023,"Dozens of France's leading stars and other well-known names have criticized what they called the ""lynching"" of screen star Gerard Depardieu amid allegations of rape and sexual assault.
In an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper on Tuesday, the celebrities said the veteran actor is the victim of a ""torrent of hatred.""  Two dozen of the 56 signatories were women, including actress Charlotte Rampling, former French first lady Carla Bruni, and Depardieu's ex-partner, actress Carole Bouquet.
The letter titled ""Don't erase Gerard Depardieu"" claims the allegations against him have been spreading ""in defiance of a presumption of innocence from which he would have benefited, like everyone else, if he weren't the cinema giant he is.""
""We are artists, writers, and film producers ... We do not wish to engage in controversy and we'll let the justice system do its job,"" the letter reads.
The signatories describe Depardieu as ""arguably the greatest actor, the last iconic figure in cinema,"" arguing that when he is attacked in this way, ""it is art that is under attack.""
""France owes him so much. Cinema and theatre cannot do without his unique and extraordinary personality,"" the celebrities said.
Depardieu, who turns 75 on Wednesday, praised the letter and called the signatories ""courageous.""
Depardieu is facing growing scrutiny of his behavior toward women during his five-decade career.
The actor has been under investigation for allegations of rape since 2020.
Multiple women have accused the award-winning actor of sexual violence, including harassment, groping or sexual assault.
A lawsuit against him for sexual abuse, which was reported to have taken place in 2007, has been ongoing since mid-September this year.
A recent documentary outlined accusations of sexual misconduct by 16 women, and showed the actor making obscene remarks and gestures during a 2018 trip to North Korea.
Disciplinary proceedings have been launched that could also see the actor lose his Legion of Honour medal, France's highest distinction.
Depardieu, who has starred in more than 200 films, denies all of the allegations.
Reacting to the letter, Paris lawmaker and feminist Raphaëlle Rémy-Leleu said the signatories are experiencing a ''denial of reality.''
She said she would have preferred for them to support initiatives against sexual violence instead.

Emmanuelle Dancourt, whose #MeTooMedia group supports sexual misconduct victims in the media industry, told BFM television that the essay's message is particularly painful for victims of sexual abuse by powerful men.
But she also said she understood how Depardieu's friends felt they had to defend him.
""The people who do this are our friends, our fathers, our husbands, our neighbors, our colleagues, people we know,"" she said.
Last week French President Emmanuel Macron said Depardieu had become the target of a ""manhunt"", while his family has denounced an ""unprecedented conspiracy"" against him.
Depardieu is no stranger to scandal, having made headlines by brawling, drunk driving and urinating in the aisle of a plane.
He has also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and has a Russian passport.

https://www.dw.com/en/czech-republic-mourns-university-shooting-victims/a-67810391,CRIME,Czech Republic mourns university shooting victims 23.12.2023,"The Czech Republic observed a minute of silence at noon on Saturday as the country holds a national day of mourning after a mass shooting at a Prague university killed 15 people including the shooter.
The shooting was carried out by a 24-year-old student who is now thought to have killed his father on the same day and a man and a baby last week.

National flags on public buildings flew at half-staff, while bells rang out at noon to mark the start of the minute of silence, which retailers said they would also observe.
Czech President Petr Pavel and speakers of both houses of Parliament attended a special Mass for the victims held at St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague, with similar religious services taking place in other cities and towns.
Christmas markets in several locations were closed or reduced their programs, with other pre-Christmas events canceled.
Mourners laid flowers and lit candles in front of the university buildings.
The shooter opened fire at the Charles University Faculty of Arts, where he had been studying, killing 13 people immediately and wounding 25 others.
The gunman then killed himself, and one of the wounded people later died in hospital.
 Police and prosecutors said they had evidence that the shooter also killed his father earlier in the day and a man and a baby near the Czech capital last week.

The university confirmed that two staff members were among the 14 people killed.
 No link to any extremist ideology or groups is suspected by investigators, who say the motive for the shooting was still unclear.
The Czech Republic has rarely experienced mass shootings. But in 2015 a man shot seven men and a woman dead in a restaurant before killing himself in the southeast, and in 2019 another gunman killed seven people and then himself in an eastern hospital.

https://www.dw.com/en/china-top-electric-automaker-byd-to-build-plant-in-hungary/a-67803705,BUSINESS,China: Top electric automaker BYD to build plant in Hungary 22.12.2023,"China's top electric carmaker BYD announced on Friday it plans to build a car factory in Hungary, in a bid to expand into Europe despite an investigation into Chinese subsidies in the tech field.
BYD Europe announced plans to build a factory in the southern Hungarian city of Szeged. It said the move would mark ""a significant step toward green mobility in Europe.""
""This state-of-the-art facility showcases BYD's commitment to sustainable development and local economies,"" it said.
Hungary celebrated the news. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said it would bring to the country ""thousands of new jobs and the latest technology in the industry of the future.""
The planned factory would be the first major consumer EV production facility for a Chinese carmaker in Europe.
BYD said it hopes by setting up the new plant to ""accelerate the entry of new energy passenger vehicles into the European market, further deepen [the firm's] global layout, and actively promote the green transformation of the global energy structure.""
It is also expected to create thousands of jobs in Hungary.
The project ""will be one of the largest investments in Hungarian economic history,"" Foreign Minister Szijjarto said, adding that the government would provide financial incentives to BYD for building the plant.
The factory's construction will ""further strengthen the position of the Hungarian economy, further strengthen the foundations of long-term economic growth, and further strengthen Hungary's position in the global electric automotive transition,"" he added.
Hungary is trying to position itself as a global hub for EV production.

BYD declared itself ""the world's leading manufacturer of new energy vehicles and power batteries,"" after becoming the first global manufacturer to pass the 5 million milestone in electric vehicle (EV) production earlier this year. Last year, it also became the first carmaker to announce that it had halted pure petrol or diesel engine car production entirely.
It had a global market share of around 18% of all electric or hybrid vehicles sold in 2022, according to a study by the EV Volumes database, compared to just 13% for US giant Tesla. However, Tesla still sells more all-electric vehicles with no hybrid component. And BYD is still almost completely dependent on its massive domestic market, with foreign sales accounting only for around 10% of its total.
China's budding electric car sector has faced growing scrutiny from the EU, which announced an investigation into Beijing subsidies which the firms have benefited from for decades. The European bloc argues that these subsidies present a risk of unfair competition.
Though an EU member, Hungary offers Asian businesses lucrative tax breaks, infrastructure and job creation subsidies as part of its ""look East"" policy.

https://www.dw.com/en/germans-well-represented-in-oscars-short-list/a-67797842,FILM,Germans well represented in Oscars short list 22.12.2023,"Kicking off Oscar season for 2024, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Thursday its short lists in 10 categories — including best original song, documentary feature, international feature, original score, visual effects and sound.
The ""Barbie"" power ballad ""I'm Just Ken"" was among several chart-toppers up for best original song.
Two more were from the same film: Dua Lipa's ""Dance the Night"" and ""What Was I Made For?"" by Billie Eilish; while Lenny Kravitz got a nod for song ""Road to Freedom"" from ""Rustin,"" and Jarvis Cocker for ""Dear Alien (Who Art In Heaven)"" from ""Asteroid City.""
Meanwhile, the Ukraine war film ""20 Days in Mariupol"" was short-listed in both the documentary and international feature categories.
The film's director, Pulitzer Prize-winning Ukrainian journalist Mstyslav Chernov, knows global attention is shifting to Israel but his film on Russian atrocities remains essential, he told DW during the film's German premiere at Berlin's Human Rights Film Festival in October.
The film, which has also won the World Cinema documentary prize following its successful Sundance premiere, is based on footage collected by Associated Press reporters in the first 20 days of Russia's siege of the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol in March 2022.
It features the shocking scene, which went viral around the world, of a pregnant woman being carried away on a stretcher after a Russian missile strike on a maternity hospital.
These snippets, drawn from 30 hours of footage, have a powerful impact. But for Chernov, they are, ""not enough to speak about all the tragedies that happened in Mariupol.""
Also in contention for the best international feature Oscar is Jonathan Glazer's British entry, ""The Zone of Interest,"" a Holocaust drama.
Winner of this year's Cannes Film Festival Grand Prix, the runner-up to the Palme d'Or prize, ""The Zone of Interest"" takes place outside the walls of the Auschwitz extermination camp and, incredibly, features no violence.
It stars Academy Award nominee Sandra Hüller (""Toni Erdmann"") in the role of Hedwig Höss, the wife of Rudolf Höss. The longest-serving commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp, Höss, played by Christian Friedel, was hanged for war crimes in 1947.
Hüller has been making headlines this award season. The German actress has earned top awards and nominations both for her portrayal of Hedwig Höss, as well as for her lead role in ""Anatomy of a Fall.""
Director Jonathan Glazer (""Under the Skin"") said Hüller was ""very apprehensive"" about portraying a Nazi on screen, something she had previously refused to do. But the British director convinced her that his film, based on the 2014 novel of the same name by British writer Martin Amis, would be different.
In the shadow of mass extermination, the entire film plays out like a family drama as the Höss family picnic by the river, play in the garden or chat with their friends.
Meanwhile, the award-winning German psychological drama, ""The Teachers' Lounge,"" made the short list with a more contemporary theme.
Described by The Hollywood Reporter as ""a pulse-pounding exploration of the ways we draw lines between enemies and friends, and the courage it takes to blur them,"" the film portrays a teacher's vain attempt to uncover a crime.
Director Ilker Catak's provocative drama shows how individuals are ultimately worn down by entrenched power.  
Tokyo-set ""Perfect Days,"" a film by veteran German director Wim Wenders, is also short-listed for best international feature and is Japan's Oscar entry.
Legendary actor Koji Yakusho won best actor in Cannes for his lead role as an ageing, Zen-like toilet cleaner in the film that showcases Tokyo's architect-designed lavatories.
Other international feature films on the 15-film short list for nominations include Tran Anh Hung's ""The Taste of Things"" (France), Lila Aviles' ""Totem"" (Mexico), Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki's ""Fallen Leaves"" and ""The Monk and the Gun"" from Bhutan.
""'The Monk and the Gun' is a story about the change and transition that Bhutan went through in the 2000s, when we became the last country in the world to allow television, to allow the internet and to allow democracy to come in,"" filmmaker Pawo Choyning Dorji told DW of the film.
Variety magazine has ranked ""The Monk and the Gun"" as a ""top-tier possibility"" for the award.
Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" and Martin Scorsese's ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" were prominently represented among the finalists in many categories, including score and sound.
The opulent ""Oppenheimer"" was a notable omission, however, among the 10 finalists in the visual effects category.
Both ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" did make the cut for makeup and hairstyling, while ""Barbie"" missed out.
Big names also featured in the live action category, with both Pedro Almodovar's western ""Strange Way of Life,"" starring Ethan Hawke and Pedro Pascal; and Wes Anderson's ""The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,"" with Benedict Cumberbatch and Ben Kingsley, in the running.
The final list of nominations in all categories for the 96th Oscars will be announced on January 23. Jimmy Kimmel hosts the award ceremony on March 10, broadcasting live from the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.

https://www.dw.com/en/prague-shooting-memorial-held-as-police-search-for-motive/a-67799025,CRIME,Prague shooting: Memorial held as police search for motive 22.12.2023,"Czech police worked on Friday to determine the motive of the man who a day earlier shot 14 people dead and injured over two dozen more in Prague.
Authorities said on Friday that the people injured included three foreigners, one person from the Netherlands and two from the United Arab Emirates. Media reports Friday varied with some placing the number killed at 13 or 14 plus the shooter. 
A 24-year-old opened fire at the Faculty of Arts of Charles University in the heart of the Czech capital. On Friday, police said the perpetrator killed himself after shooting his victims.
The mass shooting is among the country's worst attacks in recent years.
Journalist Ian Willoughby spoke to DW from Prague on Friday, saying the Czech Republic is overwhelmed with a ""very somber mood."" He described the incident as ""the worst killing of its kind in this country.""
""There have been some multiple shootings in the past, but nothing at this level, and certainly nothing at an educational institution like this,"" he said.

People could be seen lighting candles by the university headquarters on Friday morning, in an impromptu vigil for the victims. The scene of the shooting was meanwhile sealed off, with the police still pursuing its investigation into the attack.
The Czech Republic's prime minister, Petr Fiala, visited the scene of the shooting incident.
Interior Minister Vit Rakusan said Prague police worked overnight and succeeded in identifying 13 people killed. Authorities have warned the death toll could rise and their investigation continues.
The interior minister had earlier denied a link between the shooting and ""international terrorism,"" suggesting the student acted alone.
Police said there was no longer any imminent threat. Nevertheless, they continued guarding several sites on Friday, including schools, as a preventive measure.
""Starting today we have adopted countrywide preventative measures in relation to soft targets and schools,"" police said on social network X, previously known as Twitter.
The Czech government declared Saturday a national day of mourning. Flags on official buildings will be flown at half-staff and people will be asked to observe a minute of silence at noon.
Reports of the shooting emerged on Thursday afternoon from the center of Prague. Police evacuated and cordoned off the area around the Faculty of Arts at Charles University while seeking the shooter.
Prague police chief Martin Vondrasek said authorities believed the shooter had killed his father, who was found dead in the village of Hostoun, west of Prague, before proceeding with the mass shooting.
He said police believe the gunman was a student at the university, described as an excellent student with no criminal record. Rakusan said that several weapons had been found at the university building.
Charles University has a total of 49,500 students and is one of the oldest tertiary education institutions in Europe, having been founded in 1348.

Police said 14 people were killed by the shooter and at least 24 people were injured, revising the fatalities down from an earlier number of 15. 
""There is no indication that this crime has any link to international terrorism,"" Interior Minister Vit Rakusen said.
Prime Minister Petr Fiala canceled his scheduled events in the country's east and has headed for Prague.
""Due to the tragic events at the Faculty of Arts in Prague I have canceled my work schedule [in the eastern Olomouc region] and am going back to Prague,"" Fiala said on X, formerly known as Twitter.
He said he was in contact with police and the interior minister and urged citizens to cooperate with Czech rescue services.
Meanwhile, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock expressed her ""sincere condolences"" in a social media post.
""The attack in the middle of Prague hits Europe in its heart,"" she said. ""We are grieving. Our thoughts and our full sympathy go out to the friends and families of the victims.""
Czech President Petr Pavel said he was ""shocked"" and expressed ""deep regret and sincere condolences to the families and relatives of the victims.""
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen denounced ""the senseless violence of the shooting that claimed several lives today.""
The White House condemned the shooting as ""senseless.""
""The president and the first lady are praying for the families who lost loved ones and everyone else who has been affected by the senseless act of violence,"" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.
What else do we know about the shooting?
Police initially told residents to avoid the area and stay indoors, saying their operations were ongoing. A few minutes later, they said the shooter had been ""eliminated."" 
Czech Interior Minister Rakusan confirmed the death of the gunman, and said no accomplices had been found. He said that several weapons had been found at the university building.

""There have been no US-style school shootings here that I am aware of,"" he said.
""We always thought that this was a thing that did not concern us. Now it turns out that, unfortunately, our world is also changing and the problem of the individual shooter is emerging here as well,"" Prague Mayor Bohuslav Svoboda told public broadcaster Czech Television.

He cited deadly extremist attacks that hit Paris in 2015 as an example of the type of severe crisis that could force a rethink of the July 26 ceremony.
""You're 15 days from the Olympic Games. You have a series of terrorist attacks. What do you do? Well, you don't organize [a ceremony] on the Seine,"" he said in a television interview with France 5 on Wednesday.
""Since we are professional, there are obviously plan Bs, plan Cs, et cetera,"" Macron said. ""You have to be prepared for everything.""
Paris is due to host the Olympic Games from July 26 to August 11, 2024.
The opening ceremony is due to take place on the Seine instead of inside the Olympic stadium, and hundreds of thousands of people are expected to watch from the banks of the river that flows through Paris.
It would be the first Summer Games opening ceremony held outside of a usual stadium setting.
""We are preparing an opening ceremony that is unique, which I hope will make the French very proud,"" Macron told the public broadcaster. ""It will be a moment of beauty, of real art, of celebrating sport and our values, with the Seine and the capital as the theater.""

France raised its security alert to the highest level after a knife-wielding attacker stabbed a teacher to death outside a school in the north of the country in October.
Earlier this month, a German tourist was killed in a suspected terror attack close to the Eiffel Tower in central Paris. The perpetrator has reportedly pledged allegiance to the so-called ""Islamic State.""
Paris 2024 organizers ruled out a change of plans after that incident.
""There is no single fallback plan, but rather a variety of adaptation measures - what we call in our jargon contingency plans - which are not intended to be public in any other way,"" Paris 2024 said.

https://www.dw.com/en/the-tokyo-toilet-culture-that-inspired-wim-wenders-perfect-days/a-67697711,FILM,The Tokyo toilet culture that inspired Wim Wenders' 'Perfect Days' 20.12.2023,"Hirayama, the protagonist of Wim Wenders' new film ""Perfect Days,"" is a man of strict routines.
Rising every day before dawn, he carefully trims his mustache, lovingly waters his plants (dug from the grounds of a nearby shrine), climbs into his old van and drives to work. On the way he listens to a cassette from his extensive collection of ‘60s and ‘70s rock classics (The Rolling Stones, Otis Redding, the Kinks and, of course, given the film's title, Lou Reed).
Hirayama's job is cleaning the public restrooms in Toyko's Shibuya district. His work — all the scrubbing, sponging, brushing and mopping — isn't glamorous but it is an important service, and Hirayama, played with effortless cool dignity by Japanese screen legend Yakusho Koji, goes about it with the same consciousness and careful attention to detail we see in every moment of his day. 
The toilets themselves are, frankly, beautiful. One is bright white dome, like a landed spaceship. Another resembles a labyrinth of wooden planks. One has brightly colored, but transparent walls. When an American woman, clearly confused, asks how it works, Hirayama, without a word, slips inside and locks the door. The glass turns opaque.
Every one of the buildings featured in ""Perfect Days"" is an actual public toilet, part of an architecture project to renovate the facilities in Tokyo's Shibuya ward.
When the Nippon Foundation started the Tokyo Toilet Project in 2018, it was, says project coordinator Yamada Akiko, to counter the image of public toilets as ""dark, dirty, smelly and scary.""
Some of the country's leading architects, including Ban Shigeru, winner of the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize, and Kengo Kuma, the award-winning designer of the V&A Dundee museum, reinvented the idea of the public toilet with advanced designs for 17 WCs in the Shibuya area, created not just to be works of art but also structured to be accessible for everyone ""regardless of gender, age or disability.""
More than just a public service, the project is a ""way of moving toward the realization of a society that embraces diversity,"" says the Nippon Foundation. 
The Shibuya district contacted Wim Wenders, asking if he would make a documentary about the project. Wenders has a long and intimate connection to Japan. The German director cites ""Tokyo-Story"" (1953) from Japanese master Yasujiro Ozu as one of main reasons he became a filmmaker.  In 1985, he made a documentary on Ozu, ""Tokyo-Ga."" Four years later, he made ""Notebook on Cities and Clothes,"" another Japanese-set documentary, about fashion designer Yohji Yamamoto. 
But for Wenders, the Tokyo Toilet Project was about more than architecture, it was about something deep in Japanese culture. Instead of a documentary, he decided to make a feature drama with the Tokyo Toilet Project at its core. 
""On the one hand [there is] the strong feeling of 'service' and 'the common good' in Japan,"" Wenders said in a recent interview. ""On the other hand, the sheer architectural beauty of these public sanitary places. I was amazed at how much 'toilets' can be part of everyday culture, not just an almost embarrassing necessity.""
There is undoubtably something unique about Japan's toilet culture. Public toilets in Tokyo are ubiquitous. The city has 53 public WCs per 100,000 residents.
Berlin, which recently doubled the number of available facilities, still has just 11.5 per 100,000 people.
Even the most humble public facilities in Japanese gas stations or fast food restaurants are a wonder of fastidious hygiene. The country is the world leader in toilet high-tech, with washlets typically including heated seats, built-in bidets with jets to wash and dry users bottoms, automated flushing and, often, a choice of music to mask toilet noises.
Toto, the country's leading toilet manufacturer (and a partner in the Tokyo Toilet Project) has its own museum dedicated to the history of the ceramic flush toilet. 
For Wenders, Tokyo's toilets express something unique, and deeply admirable, about Japanese culture. A drama about a Berlin toilet cleaner, one imagines, would be a grim affair. But ""Perfect Days"" is actually closer to a Zen meditation on the pleasures of the simple life.
Hirayama is like a modern-day monk; his daily rituals a form of spiritual meditation. Every day, he eats his lunch on the same bench in a temple garden, and takes a photograph (with an analog camera) of the same patch of light through the treetops.
In an interview, Yakusho Kaji has said the film, co-written by Wenders and Japanese screenwriter Takuma Takasaki, is based on the Japanese concept of komorebi, a word which describes the play of light and shadow through the leaves of a tree, where every shimmering moment is precious and unique.
The depiction is idealized, but it isn't naive. There is conflict. When Hirayama’s carefully-balanced routine is disrupted —at one point he is forced to do a double shift to cover for another cleaner who quit without warning — he loses his cool in a rare angry outburst.
A short scene with his estranged sister hints at a childhood trauma Hirayama is trying to escape.
""Perfect Days"" is not some panglossian new age pap but a tender contemplation of the rewards and regrets of a flawed life (is there any other kind?), lived in a conscious and considered manner. 
It has certainly won over audiences. ""Perfect Days"" premiered at the Cannes Film Festival where Yakusho Koji took the award for best actor. Japan picked the film as its official entry for the 2024 Oscars in the best international feature category, a rare honor for a non-Japanese director. 
The Tokyo Toilet Project has been similarly successful.
According to a survey by the Nippon Foundation, satisfaction among users of the 17 redesigned facilities has shot up from 44% to nearly 90%, and the number of people with negative views of public toilets shrank from 30% to just 3%.
""People who previously didn't give much thought to public toilets have started to take an interest in the facilities,"" said Nippon Foundation Executive Director Sasakawa Junpei. Thanks in part to ""Perfect Days,"" the toilets are becoming tourist attractions in their own right.

https://www.dw.com/en/from-bach-to-brazil-with-mandolinist-avi-avital/a-67701848,MUSIC,From Bach to Brazil with mandolinist Avi Avital 19.12.2023,"
If you've ever listened to bluegrass, you're probably familiar with the mandolin. That it can also be found today on the classical concert stage is largely thanks to one contemporary artist: Avi Avital. He joined forces with the string quartet Brooklyn Rider at the 2023 Beethoven Festival in Bonn to present old, new and genre-blending works that spanned different cultures and time periods. The program included everything from Bach fugues to Balkan rhythms to Afro-Brazilian gods and goddesses.
Mandolinist Avi Avital was born in Israel in 1978. He began playing the mandolin at age eight and went on to study the instrument in Jerusalem and Padua, Italy. In 2010, he became the first mandolin player ever to be nominated for a Grammy.
A member of the lute family, the mandolin was originally a common folk music instrument. It made its way around the world over centuries, but it's thanks to Avital's expressive and virtuosic playing that it recently exploded onto the classical and new music scenes.
""The mandolin was seen as an amateur instrument throughout music history, so the great composers ... never bothered to write for the mandolin. We don't have a mandolin piece by Bach, Brahms, Schubert,"" Avital explains. ""I don't feel this is justified, and so I think one of my life missions is to change the course of the repertoire of the mandolin and to insert it into the canonic repertoire of classical music by going to living composers and pursue them to write for me, to write for the mandolin.""
Avital has commissioned more than 100 works over the past years as a way to cement the mandolin in the classical new music scene.
One such brand-new piece of music is the prelude for solo mandolin, by the contemporary Italian composer Giovanni Sollima; he composed the work specifically for Avital. Sollima drew on Italian dances like the tarantella and the pizzica, which is from Apulia, in southern Italy. The region has a festival dedicated exclusively to this style of music.
Similarly to Avital, the members of the string quartet Brooklyn Rider (Johnny Gandelsman and Colin Jacobsen, violin; Nicholas Cords, viola; Michael Nicolas, cello) perform both old and new music, which they believe are complementary.
""One of the ideals you're going for in music is to have a feeling when approaching old music that it is fresh, and you are seeing always new things. But then when you got a brand-new piece of music, you have to very quickly behave as if it's your oldest friend in the world, and that it feels not foreign but familiar,"" says violist Nicolas Cords.
Brooklyn Rider violinist Colin Jacobsen is also a composer, and one of his compositions, ""Time and Again,"" which he wrote in 2022 for string quartet and mandolin, was featured on the Beethoven Festival program.
""My piece was very much conceived with Avi in mind,"" he says, explaining that it includes Balkan rhythms yet still maintains classical elements: ""For those who are keeping score in form, it is also in a very classical sonata-ish form; those of you who are listening for that, you'll hear it.""
The other pieces on the program also spanned cultures and geography. One was ""Obrigado,"" which means ""thank you"" in Portuguese. It was written by the contemporary Brazilian-American composer, singer and pianist Clarice Assad and pays tribute to the various Afro-Brazilian gods by using musical traditions of the Afro-Brazilian religion called Umbanda.
Another work, ""Entr'acte,"" is by the contemporary American Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Caroline Shaw, who took inspiration from a Haydn quartet. 
But the old was not forgotten among the new, with arrangements of Bach fugues for string quartet and mandolin, and even a Bach chaconne arranged for mandolin making appearances in the program.
No matter what repertoire he's playing, mandolinist Avital feels deeply connected to the instrument in a physical way. ""This instrument has soul,"" he says. ""It just reacts to me where it's part of my body.""
We hope you enjoyed the works in today's show, which was hosted by Cristina Burack. Thanks to sound engineer Thomas Schmidt and producer Gaby Reucher, and thanks to all of you for listening. If you have any feedback, drop us a line at music@dw.com.

https://www.dw.com/en/how-the-nutcracker-achieved-worldwide-fame/a-46529001,CULTURE,How the nutcracker achieved worldwide fame 19.12.2023,"Ever heard of a Räuchermann — or in its diminutive form, the Räuchermännchen? The ""smoking man"" is a wooden figurine that serves as an incense burner. It's just one of the many traditional Christmas decorations from the Erzgebirge, or Ore Mountains, a Saxony border region renowned for folk art in the form of wooden angels, Christmas pyramids and candle arches known as Schwibbogen.
But the fact that no one ever came up with a proper English translation for the little smoking man suggests it isn't yet one of the region's famous international exports —  unlike its direct cousin, another wooden figure traditionally made in the Ore Mountains: the nutcracker.
A German-French-Russian-American story
The nutcracker gained international recognition thanks to its various cultural representations, and the fact that authors from different countries borrowed from the original tale. International copyright agreements didn't exist when an initial version of the little toy figure's story was written by German Romantic author E. T. A. Hoffmann in 1816, titled ""The Nutcracker and the Mouse King.""
It was adapted by French writer Alexandre Dumas in 1844. The plot of ""Histoire d'un casse-noisette"" (simply called the ""The Nutcracker"" in English) was nearly identical — but the French version wasn't nearly as dark as the German one.
In any case, Dumas' adaptation served as the basis for the 1892 Russian ballet choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, with music composed by Pyotr Illyich Tchaikovsky.
The first complete performance of the ballet only reached England in 1934, and it was staged for the first time in the US during the Christmas of 1944 by the San Francisco Ballet company.
It was such a hit there that it has been staged during the holiday season ever since. With hundreds of productions every year, the ballet is now a firmly entrenched Christmas ritual for thousands of families in the US — and throughout the world.  
Friedrich Wilhelm Füchtner, the Ore Mountain carver who came up with the first ""mass produced"" model of a nutcracker in 1870, obviously didn't know that the character would one day become the star of an international ballet classic. He actually had another version of the story in mind when he created his figurine, one written by the creator of ""Der Struwwelpeter"" (Shaggy Peter), Heinrich Hoffmann, in 1851.
The German figurine found its way into homes around the world much later. One woodcarving company from the Ore Mountains, Steinbach, had to relocate to Hanover after World War II, where many American soldiers were stationed nearby. The soldiers started to bring back nutcracker dolls for their families as typical souvenirs from Germany.
The collectible figures continue to attract visitors to the eastern German region renowned for its wooden folk art.
Along with the area's different workshops, the Nussknackermuseum in Neuhausen, the ""first nutcracker museum in Europe,"" is another recommended stop. It not only retains the record for the largest nutcracker collection in the world; it also hosts different events throughout the year beyond its exhibition, such as an annual nutcracker collectors' convention.
Asked why the nutcracker became so closely associated with Christmas, the museum's owner, Uwe Löschner, provided a down-to-earth explanation that's typical of the pragmatism of the people of the region: ""During Christmas time, poor people used their nuts when they would bake their traditional Stollen (fruit bread) and cookies; and nutcrackers were used to crack those nuts,"" he told DW.
The nutcracker is more than a just a good-looking tool. Its symbolism continues to be shared across generations and countries thanks to the fairy tale that contributed to its international fame — a universal story of hope and of triumph of good over evil.

https://www.dw.com/en/the-monk-and-the-gun-why-bhutans-oscar-entry-unties-a-knot/a-67576303,FILM,'The Monk and the Gun': Why Bhutan's Oscar entry 'unties a knot' 19.12.2023,"Filmmaker Pawo Choyning Dorji's family originally comes from the eastern part of Bhutan where, if a child asks a parent to tell them a story, they ask them to ""untie a knot.""
Dorji's latest film, ""The Monk and the Gun,"" is his way of untying the knot that was his homeland's social, political and cultural transition in the mid-2000s. 
""I was growing up during this period and 'The Monk and the Gun' is a story about the change and transition that Bhutan went through in the 2000s, when we became the last country in the world to allow television, to allow the internet and to allow democracy to come in,"" Dorji said. 
But as a Bhutanese living in India, where his father was a diplomat, and returning to his homeland for school holidays, he had a unique perspective on the changes that were engulfing the Himalayan kingdom.  
""In Bhutan, we have a saying that you cannot see your eyelashes because they are so close to you. For me, that was the situation. A lot of Bhutanese at that time could not see the changes and the impact of that transition because it was so close to them,"" Dorji told DW in Thimphu, Bhutan's capital. 
""But for me, as a Bhutanese living abroad, I could see how our society and culture was changing — and I always thought this would make an amazing story to share with the world. It's a story of where we as Bhutanese came from and where we are going."" 
The film is set in 2006, as Bhutan shifts to a democracy and the government organizes mock elections to teach the people how to vote. In a connected plotline, an American collector of antique weapons arrives in search of a legendary rifle that falls into the hands of a monk. 
The story is political satire and gentle comedy with elements of suspense combined with touching scenes, Dorji says, with audiences in different parts of the world responding to different elements. 
When the film received its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado on September 1, audiences laughed at the political satire, while viewers in South Korea responded to the ""story of family,"" Dorji added. 
But the response in his homeland was the most powerful, he admits. 
""When the film went to Bhutan, it was really beautiful because I had a cinema where all the audience was crying and becoming emotional because they connected in a very personal, intimate way in the loss of innocence because they lived through that period of change and transition."" 
""The Monk and the Gun"" is Bhutan's submission to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the 96th Academy Awards for the Best International Feature Film. A total of 89 titles are on the initial list, with the academy to announce the 15-film shortlist on December 21. The official nominations will be unveiled on January 23, 2024, ahead of the March 10 Oscars ceremony.
Variety magazine has ranked ""The Monk and the Gun"" as a ""top-tier possibility"" for the award. 
Bhutan has only previously submitted two films for consideration for an Oscar, ""The Cup,"" in 1999, by Dorji's film-making mentor and spiritual teacher Khyentse Norbu, and Dorji's own directorial debut, ""Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom,"" in 2021.  
""Lunana"" — the heartwarming tale of a teacher posted to the most remote village in Bhutan — made history when it became the first Bhutanese film to be nominated for an Oscar. 
""Lunana is a story about finding home, where you belong,"" he said. ""It is a very diverse film, it is of a culture that many people do not know of, it is set in a country that many people do not know of, it is in a language that many people have never heard of. When I submitted it to the Oscars, they did not even recognize 'Dzongkha,' my national language. The country of Bhutan was not even on the Oscars list."" 
After winning stunning reviews and multiple film awards around the world, Dorji received the Heart Son of the Thunder Dragon, Bhutan's highest civilian award, from King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck.
Critical and commercial success enabled Dorji to focus on his second film and the challenges of a poor, developing country in the 21st century. 
""Yes, the movie focuses on the transition to democracy in Bhutan, but it is more about modernization,"" Dorji said of ""The Monk and the Gun."" ""What interests me is how Bhutanese culture reacts to that change."" 
""The gun in the movie represents the arrival of modernization. A gun is something Western and modern and yes, if you use it in the right way, it can be very beneficial. But it is also very dangerous.""
Dorji instructed his actors to be bemused by the weapon; to hold it upside down, look down the barrel, because he wanted to portray their innocence in the face of change. And the gun is counterpointed by a large wooden phallus, a traditional symbol in Bhutan that the film used to portray tradition, culture and innocence. 
Dorji insists he has not thought about winning the Oscar in Los Angeles next year but is focused on ""sharing Bhutan's culture with the rest of the world."" 
""We are a culture that is based on the Buddha's teaching of love, compassion, wisdom and kindness and I want to use films to share that with the rest of the world,"" he said. ""But I also want to make films based on these values to keep our traditions relevant and alive for local Bhutanese.""

https://www.dw.com/en/remembering-lars-vogt-at-the-2023-heimbach-festival/a-67688095,MUSIC,Remembering Lars Vogt at the 2023 Heimbach Festival 18.12.2023,"
Imagine you had to program a concert — but not just any concert. Your very last concert ever. What music would you choose? Pianist Lars Vogt chose Brahms' Piano Quartet in C minor.
In summer 2022, Vogt was dying of cancer, and he and his loved ones knew he didn't have long. In September that year, his death unleashed profound grief at the Heimbach ""Spannungen"" (""tensions"") music festival, which he had founded some 25 years prior. He had also served as its artistic director, performed as a pianist there and conducted many of the ensembles.
Vogt was in his late 20s when he launched the festival, and he wanted to create a musical experience that contrasted with the typical philharmonic hall operation. He envisioned a place of retreat, a festival with a family feel, where the highest quality chamber music is performed in innovative, thoughtful and intimate ways.
And he achieved this: The festival kicked off in 1998 and soon became a meeting place for Germany's best chamber musicians. Its fame grew quickly and soon extended beyond Germany to Europe and the rest of the world.
Today, the Heimbach music festival is known as the ""Bayreuth of chamber music,"" with audience members traveling from as far as the US and Japan to attend concerts.
Heimbach is a quiet town in the hilly Eifel region of western Germany, right on the border to Belgium and the festival is set in the town's striking hydroelectric plant from the early 20th century. Built in the ""Jugendstil,"" or art nouveau style, it's replete with graceful curves and elegant geometry. It also has incredible acoustics.
Vogt's passing left a profound hole in the festival, but also renewed a sense of purpose among the artists, the loyal audience, the festival helpers and the sponsors: to carry on the unique spirit of the festival that Vogt had poured his soul into.
""There is something very, very special about this festival,"" says Tanja Tetzlaff, a cellist who has long been involved in the festival and helped organize the 2023 edition, which was dedicated to Vogt. ""It's not about showing off or appearances, about fame or standing in the spotlight; it's really just about the music and the friendships and the relationship with the audience. I'm quite optimistic about what comes next because Heimbach is already such an institution in Germany and internationally. That won't change quickly.""
Vogt was proud of his festival, especially of how it combined well-known pieces and historic works with musical rarities and contemporary compositions. Vogt shared his opinion in an interview some three years ago:
""I think we've built a certain 'brand,' to use a modern term. But it can be described in a nicer way — we've built trust. When people attend a concert here, they'll see two, maybe three composers on the program that they haven't heard of. And maybe also new music. But they trust the artists and know that whatever they do will make sense, and they're open to it. That's the way it should be: We should be broadening people's perspectives. And I hope it stays this way.""
The 2023 festival did just that, with its innovative program of contemporary music, classics reimagined and even brand-new works.
Ten contemporary composers wrote new compositions for the festival edition, including the Austrian composer Olga Neuwirth. Her piece was entitled ""In Memoriam Lars"" and featured Tanja Tetzlaff on violin.
Another unique work was the final piece on the festival's opening concert: a chamber music arrangement of Beethoven's sixth symphony, the ""Pastoral"" symphony. There was no conductor, no large orchestra — just a string sextet led by first violinist Antje Weithaas. It was grand orchestral repertoire reduced to minimal instrumentation, to its essentials, one could even say, and it certainly let the audience hear the work in a new way.
We hope you enjoyed the works in today's show, which was hosted by Cristina Burack. Thanks to sound engineer Thomas Schmidt and producer Anastassia Boutsko, and thanks to all of you for listening. If you have any feedback, drop us a line at music@dw.com.

https://www.dw.com/en/moldovan-school-fights-for-survival-with-eu-help/a-67746177,EDUCATION,Moldovan school fights for survival with EU help 16.12.2023,"Decent living conditions, better-paid jobs, a normal health care system, clean cities, a well-functioning infrastructure: These are just some of the things that people in the Republic of Moldova would like, and the reason why many would prefer to live in a different country.
Corruption and poverty are fueling people's desire to leave. Those who can often opt for the European Union, where they hope to find a better, more welcoming world. Those who are forced to stay are doing their best to make ends meet.
In the village of Drujba (which means friendship in Russian), not far from the border with Romania, a school is fighting for its survival. The village is relatively young; it was founded only 50 years ago, when Moldova was part of the Soviet Union. But there has been a steady population drain since the early 1990s after the fall of the communist regime, as people seek better lives elsewhere.
The local high school was converted into a kindergarten and elementary school of four classes in 1993.
There are currently only 29 pupils at the school, and thus a high risk that the establishment will be closed down. So, staff members are doing their best to prove that it can survive on minimal resources.
There are limited funds provided by the government for maintenance, and the school has not been able to attract any other project funding because of the small number of pupils. It was slated to be ""optimized,"" or closed, but before this happened, school director Angela Chitoraga contacted several embassies in the capital Chisinau, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) away, and asked them for help. 
And help came, including from Germany. ""As part of the 'New energy infrastructure for Drujba' project, the German embassy gave us 400,000 lei [around €20,000/$22,500] in financial support,"" Chitoraga told DW.
This money was used to install a photovoltaic system. The heating system was also modernized, and the walls thermally insulated. The school is currently the only public institution in the whole district that runs on solar power.
""I'm so proud about this project. Several educational establishments in the district called and asked me if it was true that we had a photovoltaic system. Nobody believed that such a small school could be saved,"" said Chitoraga.
Before, the kindergarten and school were spending around 100,000 lei (about €5,000) on electricity, wood and coal each year. Since the solar-powered system was introduced, there has been a significant reduction of expenses. The energy generated is used to heat the school, kindergarten, and library, as well as to prepare meals.
When energy consumption is low, during the summer vacations, for example, the surplus production is fed into the electricity grid, which generates additional income for the establishment. The school has been able to employ additional staff with the money saved.
There are 35 children in the kindergarten, while the school has five children in year one, seven in year two, eight in year three and nine in year four.
""It's not the children's fault that more and more families are leaving their village,"" said Chitoraga. ""But the children who live here want to learn! As these children are far away from the city, they are still marginalized and disadvantaged. They can't attend art or sports schools; they can't go to the theater or the cinema. They at least have the right to a school in their village.""
It's nice and warm in the kindergarten. The few children there have just eaten and are playing on the floor. Though they surely don't understand how the solar panels on the roof work in detail, they do know it is the sun that keeps them warm in summer, and now in winter. The teachers explain that they have taught the children about green energy and protecting the environment.
Locals were curious when the solar panels were installed, with many stopping by to see if they could put in similar systems to avoid using wood or coal to make fires. There is no gas supply to the village, and thus most households have a pile of wood waiting to be burned.

Employees from the company that installed the photovoltaic systems came to inform the villagers. During their breaks, the children would also listen in to find out just exactly how the panels on the roof could generate electricity and heat.
Ana Caracas, who lives directly opposite the school, works as a guard there. One of her boys is in first grade and another is in kindergarten. She said that lots of people showed interest in the solar panels after they were installed, but the price was usually too high and most could not afford to install such systems at home.
The school director's family is considering installing a photovoltaic system on their house in the spring. Chitoraga said her children, who volunteered abroad, had taught her that she had to actively look for projects that make a difference. Her main goal is to find ways to prevent her school from being closed down.
This year, she and another teacher attending a football training session so that she could acquire footballs for the school. ""Most of the people there were men but I played football with them and ended up bringing the kids back a whole sack of balls. Now they have something to play with,"" she said.
Chitoraga's son, who lives in France, also helps. Every year, he comes over with a group of volunteers, bringing school equipment and clothes for the children. When a big storm damaged the roof, he collected donations for a new one.
""I never thought that as a small village with a small school, we would receive so much help. It is an investment in the future of these children, in the future of this village and in the future of this country,"" said Chitoraga.

https://www.dw.com/en/bulgaria-starts-dismantling-soviet-monument-in-sofia/a-67716409,POLITICS,Bulgaria starts dismantling Soviet monument in Sofia 14.12.2023,"Work got underway in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia late Tuesday and into Wednesday to dismantle a 70-year-old Soviet monument which has divided society.
The towering ""Monument to the Soviet Army"" was erected just to the south-east of downtown Sofia in 1954 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the arrival of Red Army troops in the city following a coup d'etat which overthrew Bulgaria's Nazi-aligned government.
Holding the machine gun at the top of the 45-meter-high (147-foot) structure is a victorious Soviet soldier, flanked by a mother and child and a worker. Further down, the plinth is decorated with reliefs featuring World War II battle scenes.
One of several such monuments across Bulgaria, and one of over 4,000 across Europe, it has dominated the Sofia skyline ever since as a symbol not just of victory over fascism, but also of what would become 45 years of hardline communist rule as Bulgaria was absorbed into the Soviet bloc.
When the USSR collapsed in 1989, the local council voted to have it removed but successive governments have shied away from actually going through with it, often under pressure from the Russian embassy and pro-Russian elements of society.
Nowadays, Bulgaria is a member both of the European Union and NATO and a recent poll showed that the majority of Sofia residents would like to see the monument removed and put in a museum, or even demolished.
The park surrounding the monument has become a gathering place for young people and alternative sub-cultures, and it has often been painted by artists in different colors – most recently in the blue and yellow colors of Ukraine.
""This propaganda tool from bygone days must disappear from the city center,"" 19-year-old economics student Daniel Roussev told AFP news agency.
The newly-elected mayor of Sofia, Vassil Terziev, made dismantling the monument one of his key election promises.
Officially, authorities have said they are taking the monument down because it has become structurally unsafe, but local councilor Marta Georgieva said jubilantly: ""It is a long-awaited event.""

Nevertheless, one third of Sofians are opposed to its removal and the socialists and other pro-Moscow groups in parliament would like to organize a referendum on its fate.
On Tuesday, Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) leader Kornelia Ninova commented: ""Every monument is a piece of history, and we erase a piece of history every time we remove a monument."" 
A heavy police presence was dispatched to the area around the monument to prevent possible clashes.
""This monument has a rightful place as it illustrates our history and the art of the time,"" Vessela Naidenova, a 38-year-old researcher, told AFP. She came to protest against the dismantling.
Russia has strongly criticized the dismantling.
""We consider the destruction of the monument to our common past as another hostile step by official Sofia, which aggravates the already deadlocked situation in bilateral relations. Bulgaria once again chooses the wrong side of history,"" Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said.
According to Bulgarian media, she added: ""The barbaric actions of the Bulgarian side have no justification and forgiveness.""
Originally slated to take at least a month to dismantle, authorities hope that the work could be finished by Christmas, after which the figures — arm, machine gun and all — are expected to be restored and taken to the Sofia's Museum of Socialist Art.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-celebrates-250-years-of-caspar-david-friedrich/a-67595101,LIFESTYLE,Germany celebrates 250 years of Caspar David Friedrich 13.12.2023,"""Save the Year,"" notes the website dedicated to Caspar David Friedrich's 250th anniversary, which Germany will celebrate throughout 2024 with a variety of events and exhibitions.
While the Hamburger Kunsthalle opens its exhibition dedicated to the Romantic painter on December 15, the anniversary year will officially start on on January 20 at St. Nicholas' Cathedral in Greifswald, where Freidrich was baptized.
The legacy of the painter already making headlines ahead of the offical celebrations when one of his sketchbooks sold for €1.8 million (nearly $2 million) at auction in Berlin at the end of November. 
Shortly before the sale, Berlin's Senate Department for Culture initiated proceedings to have Friedrich's work entered in the Berlin state register of nationally valuable cultural assets. This stopped buyers outside of Germany taking the sketchbook out of the country — at least until after the conclusion of those proceedings. Even then, it would only be possible to export the sketchbook if it fails to meet criteria deeming it a valuable cultural asset.
A look at the item's provenance, however, shows that it is indeed a truly unique treasure.
The ""Karlsruhe Sketchbook,"" as it is known, had been in the possession of the Kersting family for over 200 years. Georg Friedrich Kersting, a notable German Romantic painter in his own right, was a close friend of Caspar David Friedrich — who was born in Greifswald, now in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, on September 5, 1774.
In his recently published book on Caspar David Friedrich, ""Zauber der Stille"" (Magic of Silence), German author Florian Illies writes that the artist's contemporaries reported Kersting helping his friend with the depictions of figures in his paintings. Why?
Illies writes that Friedrich was considered a less-than-talented portraitist, for which he was even ridiculed during his time at the art academy in Copenhagen.
Is that the reason the figures in Friedrich's paintings are usually seen from behind?

 
Caspar David Friedrich was the sixth child of Greifswald soap boiler and chandler Adolf Gottlieb Friedrich and his wife, Sophie Dorothea. She died in 1781, and one of his sisters died a year later.
Especially traumatic was the 1787 death of his younger brother Johann Christopher. There are conflicting stories of what happened, with some accounts saying the younger boy drowned while trying to save Caspar David, who had broken through ice while skating. Of the painter's nine siblings, only five survived to adulthood.
In 1790, Friedrich began his studies under Greifswald University architecture and drawing teacher Johann Gottfried Quistorp, who gave him particular encouragement. Friedrich continued his artistic studies at the art academy in Copenhagen. From 1798, Friedrich lived and worked in Dresden, where he died on May 7, 1840.
""Mystic with a paintbrush"" is how Swedish poet Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom described Caspar David Friedrich. The Romantic painter gained the admiration of his colleagues during his lifetime.
There was one notable exception, however: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe did not know what to make of Friedrich's paintings. He derided them as ""New German, religiously patriotic."" The poet is even said to have smashed one of the artist's paintings on the edge of a table because he didn't like it.
In 1794, Friedrich attended the art academy in Copenhagen, where he first encountered the nature mysticism that would so strongly influence his artwork. His first oil painting was provocative: the work ""Cross in the Mountains"" from 1807/1808 deals with the relationship of nature and God.
From then on, Friedrich's work was no longer the Enlightenment's window on the world, but a window to the soul, in the spirit of Romanticism. ""Cross in the Mountains"" caused a stir because in it, the painter gave equal space to both the church and nature.
Friedrich was a reclusive eccentric who only left his house in Dresden for long walks after dusk. On January 21, 1818, he married 25-year-old Caroline Bommer — at 6 o'clock in the morning.
He was unsettled by the military campaigns of  Napoleon and the presence of French troops because they threatened him and his homeland. By 1806, Napoleon had occupied the majority of German territory.
That sparked nationalist sentiments in Friedrich. The artist dreamed of the ideal of a united Germany and had equal reverence for both the Christian and the Germanic. His paintings often feature figures wearing traditional German costumes, a subtle expression of patriotism.
Though Friedrich's brush and pencil faithfully captured each tree, cliff, mountain or unfurled sail, in his works he freely reassembled those individually observed elements. Nature was an inspiration for him, not a template.
He combined his impressions into invented landscapes from his own imagination, such as ""The Sea of Ice."" The apocalyptic painting turns the frozen Elbe River into a wide sea, with a shipwreck crushed between slabs of thick ice, ominously piled high in the center of the image — a scene never witnessed by Friedrich, only imagined by him.
Until his death in 1820, he lived just a stone's throw from the Elbe River. His house, at An der Elbe 33 in Dresden, was where he hosted future Russian Czar Nicholas I, who bought several of his paintings.
While the Enlightenment emphasized reason and a rational understanding of the world, the Romantic period that followed was marked by emotion and sensitivity. Subjective moods were given prominence, which can be seen in the art of Caspar David Friedrich.
Friedrich responded to the strict compositions of the Enlightenment with disquiet and emotion: jagged mountain landscapes, morning mist, gloomy layers of cloud that sometimes threaten to swallow people up.
One of his major works is ""Monk by the Sea,"" which he began in 1808. It's considered one of his most unconventional works, as there is no sense of spatial perspective; sea and sky merge. In the foreground, a small and reverent man stands with his back turned to the viewer — thus acting as a proxy and a figure of identification. Infinity and the enormity of the universe are the themes of the painting.
""Chalk Cliffs on Rügen"" is considered one of Friedrich's most beautiful paintings, and it's among the most famous. He created it during his honeymoon in 1818. As if through a window, a motif frequently used by the painter, the view opens onto the Baltic Sea and a bright sky in the distance. The eye follows sailing ships gliding toward the horizon.
A number of works by Friedrich have been lost over the years. On October 10, 1901, for instance, his birthplace at Lange Strasse 28 in Greifswald burned down. Some of the paintings kept there were saved, but well-meaning relatives painted over them, thus destroying those that survived.
Several works by Friedrich were also among the art treasures lost during the Allied bombing raids on Dresden during World War II.
Today, the majority of the remaining pieces are in the collections of museums in Hamburg, Dresden and Berlin.
Friedrich died in poverty on May 7, 1840, his style of art no longer in vogue. New aesthetic movements had superseded Romanticism. Naturalism and Impressionism overtook Friedrich, leaving him behind.
His work had begun to lose its prestige by the 1820s, as the Dusseldorf School of painting became fashionable in Germany.
The rediscovery of his art began in 1906 with a small exhibition in Berlin that presented paintings and sculptures from the period of 1775 to 1875, and included 32 works by Friedrich.
That launched a phase of popularity that continues to this day. Friedrich never signed any of his paintings because he believed his name would never be forgotten. So far, he's been right.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-star-sandra-h%C3%BCller-shines-from-europe-to-los-angeles/a-67408315,FILM,"German star Sandra Hüller shines, from Europe to Los Angeles 11.12.2023","German actress Sandra Hüller was the undisputed star of this year's European Film Awards (EFAs).
Europe's answer to the Oscars, the EFAs were held in Berlin on December 9. 
Hüller had received an unprecedented dual nomination in the best actress category for her leading roles in Justine Triet's ""Anatomy of a Fall,"" and Jonathan Glazer's ""The Zone of Interest."" 
She not only won the best actress award for her performance in ""Anatomy of a Fall,"" which was also proclaimed best film at the EFAs, but a day later, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association picked Jonathan Glazer's  Auschwitz-set drama as best film of the year, and one of the association's top acting awards also went to Hüller.
Both movies were big winners at the Cannes Film Festival this year, where ""Anatomy of a Fall"" took the Palme d'Or, and ""The Zone of Interest"" won the Grand Prix, the runner-up to the Palme d'Or prize.
And both are major Academy Awards contenders as the official submissions from France and the UK for the best international feature Oscar. On Monday, they were both nominated for the Golden Globe for the best non-English-language film. Hüller was also among the nominees for best female actor in the drama category, for her performance in ""Anatomy of a Fall."" She also nabbed a nomination for the Critics' Choice Movie Awards.
Sandra Hüller is well-known among arthouse aficionados, not least for her barnstorming performance in Maren Ade's Oscar-nominated ""Toni Erdmann"" (2016). But with ""Anatomy of a Fall"" and ""The Zone of Interest,"" 2023 could be the year the 45-year-old actress goes mainstream. 
Hüller was born on April 30, 1978 and grew up in the small town of Friedrichroda in rural Thuringia, in what was then East Germany.
An inspiring teacher and a school theater course brought her to Berlin where, shortly after the Berlin Wall fell, she applied and was accepted to Berlin's renowned Ernst Busch Academy of Dramatic Arts. She was just 17. 
Her ascent to the top of Germany's theater world was quick. In 2003, the year she graduated from Ernst Busch, Hüller was voted best young actress in a poll of German critics for Theater Heute magazine. 
She's stayed true to her theater roots even as she moved into film, regularly returning to the stage in between movie roles.
And she has remained a critical favorite, winning Theater Heute's actress of the year in 2010, 2013, 2019 and most recently in 2020 for an acclaimed gender-flipped performance of Hamlet for Dutch director Johan Simons. 
In Hüller's movie debut — in Hans-Christian Schmid's ""Requiem"" (2006) — she plays a young woman from a devout Catholic family who take her epileptic seizures and rebellious free-thinking as a sign of demonic possession. They order a brutal, ultimately fatal, exorcism.
Hüller's performance, wrenching and visceral, won her the Silver Bear for best actress at the 2006 Berlin Film Festival. 
But it was her performance a decade later, in Maren Ade's improbably-funny German cringe comedy, ""Toni Erdmann,"" that would prove to be Hüller's international breakout.
She plays an ambitious and uptight corporate consultant whose career plans are disrupted by the unwanted interventions of her loving, prankster father, played by the late Peter Simonischek.
Hüller's performance — which includes a raw, heartfelt, but also hilarious rendition of the Whitney Houston song ""Greatest Love of All"" — leaves it all on the screen. 
The London Critics Circle, the Toronto Film Critics Association and America's National Society of Film Critics, thought it was the best female performance of the year.
The European Film Academy agreed, giving Hüller the 2016 award for best actress. 
""Anatomy of a Fall"" and ""The Zone of Interest,"" two radically different films, show Hüller's tremendous range as an actress.
""Anatomy"" is a twisty French legal drama. It is an intellectual thriller about Sandra, a successful German novelist (Hüller), living in an isolated chalet in the French Alps, who may or may not have killed her French husband, played by Samuel Theis.
Director Justine Triet, who says she wrote the film specifically with Hüller in mind, refused to tell anyone, neither her actors nor the audience, whether Sandra is guilty or innocent.
Hüller's performance, acting in English and French, is ambiguous till the end. Nearly every scene, whether fighting with her husband, comforting their young son or pleading her case in courtroom can be read both ways. 
In Jonathan Glazer's ""The Zone of Interest,"" there's little ambiguity and virtually no sign of emotion in Hüller's turn as Hedwig Höss, the real-life wife of Rudolf Höss, the longest-serving commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Höss, played in the film by Christian Friedel, was hanged for war crimes in 1947.
Glazer says Hüller was ""very apprehensive"" about portraying a Nazi on screen, something that she had until then refused to do.
But the British director convinced her his film would be different. It certainly is.
""The Zone of Interest"" looks and feels unlike any Holocaust drama before it. The film never directly shows the atrocities of Auschwitz. There's not a single scene of violence. Instead, the entire movie plays out like a perverse family drama as we watch Rüdiger and Hedwig Höss picnic by the river, play with their children in the garden or chat with their friends.
Just out of sight, but within earshot — there are echoes of gunfire, barking dogs and howls of pain — the murder continues. 
Glazer rebuilt the Höss family home in Auschwitz, just meters from the the former concentration camp that is now a memorial site, and installed surveillance-like cameras to capture the actors as they did their scenes — an approach he's called ""Big Brother in a Nazi house."" By staging his film as a reality-TV show, Glazer breaks the easy cinema conventions and clichés of the Holocaust movie. Instead of framing Hedwig and Rudolf Höss as monsters, he shows them as ordinary, even boring, making their actions both relatable and all the more horrifying. As Hedwig, Hüller is cold, almost emotionally inert. Her eyes are dark and dead, opening into a void. 
Taken together, ""An Anatomy of a Fall"" and ""The Zone of Interest"" show an actress at the peak of her powers.

https://www.dw.com/en/japan-unpacking-the-nuances-of-the-traditional-bow/a-67687741,CULTURE,Japan: Unpacking the nuances of the traditional bow 11.12.2023,"To the Japanese, the bow is something they do every day. Children bow to their teacher and say ""ohayou gozaimasu,"" or ""good morning,"" at the start of every school day. It would be unthinkable for a business meeting to commence without formal bows.
Shop staff and train conductors, hotel employees, janitors and deliverymen all bow to their customers. Even passing a colleague in a corridor will inevitably elicit eye contact and a deep nod.
It's a greeting, and it's polite. But a bow to a Japanese person imparts much more information, with each variety having a nuance that communicates a slightly different meaning.
""Bowing is a key part of greetings in Japan,"" said Kiyomoto Ogasawara, the heir to the 32nd headmastership of the Ogasawara-ryu school of ""reiho,"" or etiquette.
""Bowing signifies trust and peace by showing vulnerability, as we avert our eyes and expose the head,"" explained Ogasawara, whose family has served as instructors to generations of shoguns since the school was established more than 830 years ago.
Alongside ""reiho,"" Ogasawara-ryu masters teach the disciplines of archery and mounted archery, an important military skill as well as a religious ritual at Shinto shrines since ancient times.

And while etiquette and archery may not appear to be compatible skills, Ogasawara said incorporating proper etiquette into a person's daily life is required to attain the strong legs and perfect posture needed to have both hands free to fire a bow from a galloping horse.
And that's why, historically, warriors and the elite in society were taught that posture and etiquette are of such importance.
It's widely believed that bowing became the accepted greeting as far back as the Asuka period, between 593 A.D. and 710 A.D. Buddhism was arriving in Japan from mainland Asia and there were shifts in the nascent nation's artistic, social and political mores.
In the Buddhist faith, bowing was — and remains — an important gesture of respect and piety, and it was soon adopted to indicate similar reverence for the elite in Japan's strictly hierarchical society.
And while the samurai no longer rule Japan, the bow has endured as the mark of respect. And failing to perform an adequate bow can still be perceived as a slight, particularly among older, more traditional Japanese.
Today, the bow is the time-honored greeting in Japan, but it's also used to communicate farewell, the start or end of a class, meeting or ceremony and to express gratitude. The bow is also used as an apology, to accompany a request or show sympathy or appreciation. It is deployed when a person is worshipping or at the outset of formal ceremony, and is a critical element of martial arts.
There are three main types of bow in the Japanese business world, but each starts from the same position: straight back, legs straight and firmly planted to avoid slouching. The bow should then be performed in time with one's breathing.
Bending forward from the waist should take one inhalation of breath. That position is then sustained for the time it takes to exhale and then the person performing the bow inhales again as he or she returns to an upright position.
The ""eshaku"" bow is a relatively casual greeting, exchanged between people of the same status or when formalities are not as important, and only requires leaning forward to an angle of 15 degrees for a few seconds.
Japan's national sport can now be enjoyed along with a meal. The Yokozuna Tonkatsu Dosukoi Tanaka restaurant opened its doors in Tokyo in 2022, as a place for former sumo wrestlers to demonstrate the traditional art. The concept has been met with great enthusiasm from diners.







The ""keirei"" bow is the most common variant in the Japanese business world, and requires the person to lean at an angle of 30 degrees and look at the ground about 1 meter (about 3 feet) in front of their toes.
A ""keirei"" bow is used to greet clients, join a meeting or during interactions with superiors.
The ""saikeirei"" indicates the greatest respect to the recipient and requires a bow from the waist of as much as 70 degrees and sustained for several seconds to emphasize respect and sincerity. The ""saikeirei"" is deployed to greet a very important person, such as a member of the imperial family, to express deep regret or ask for a significant favor.
Men performing these bows are expected to keep their arms rigid alongside their legs, while women often place one hand atop the other in front of the abdomen.
Bows performed in the seated position are known as ""zarei"" and usually take place on traditional tatami mat floors during traditional occasions, such as the tea ceremony or martial arts tournaments.
All seated bows start from the ""seiza"" seated posture, with the legs tucked directly below and with the toes pointing straight behind. The person sits on their calves with the elbows pointed slightly out and with the palms of the hands on the top of the thighs.
This position can be uncomfortable for non-Japanese, especially if it has to be sustained for a long time, but Japanese will appreciate good posture.
The ""saikeirei"" bow starts at the ""seiza"" position and requires the person to lean forward until their chest is on their lap. Simultaneously, the hands slide forward along the thighs until they are on the tatami floor in front of the knees.
The final position will see the person's face around 5 centimeters (2 inches) from the floor, and the palms of the hands making a triangle on the floor.
The ""futsurei"" is a less formal variety of the same bow and only requires the person to dip their body until their head is around 30 centimeters from the floor. The ""senrei"" is even more relaxed and only requires the person to bow about 30 degrees from the waist and have the tips of their fingers on the tatami.
Another, far more rare bow, is the ""dogeza,"" which requires the person to get on their hands and knees and place their face on the ground — and was in the past used when a person was begging for their life after somehow offending a powerful superior.










Matthew Strecher, a professor of Japanese literature at Sophia University in Tokyo, was given lessons in etiquette when he first arrived in Japan in the 1980s. Emphasis was placed on a proper bow and ""not just ducking my head briefly,"" he said.
""Some latitude is given to foreign people when they try to bow and I think Japanese are even quite amused as they watch us try to get it right, but I do think they appreciate the effort,"" he said. ""In the same way, they do not appreciate it when we flout expectations and make no effort at what is quite a special moment.""
After more than three decades in Japan, Strecher said he knows when a less formal nod to a colleague in passing is adequate and occasions when a greater expression of gratitude or respect is required.
""If I am saying goodbye, then it is important to bow properly because failing to do that would not be appreciated, and in a business setting we are expected to do the right thing because it is about ensuring the harmony of the workplace,"" he added.
Kiyomoto Ogasawara said younger generations of Japanese do not grasp the exact meaning of Japan's most important form of unspoken communication.
""Actually, the subtle meanings of different bows are less known nowadays, even in Japan,"" he admitted. ""While they were traditionally learned in the home, I believe that anyone can grasp these nuances, with some studying,"" he told DW.
""Bowing reflects our cultural identity, so it is vital for understanding our roots and sharing them with others,"" he added.
""It is part of our culture, influenced by many factors, such as our history and environment. Recognizing and using different forms of bowing is very valuable.""

https://www.dw.com/en/a-rubens-painting-keeps-the-courts-busy/a-67644466,ARTS,A Rubens painting keeps the courts busy 10.12.2023,"""Tarquinius and Lucretia"" is the subject of long German-Russian disputes. The painting by Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) disappeared from Germany after World War II. Around 20 years ago, it was discovered in Russia — in the possession of art dealer Vladimir Logvinenko.
The story didn't end there. Logvinenko tried to have his ownership rights recognized in Germany — unsuccessfully. This attempt at clarification could well have been motivated by a desire to sell the painting, which is estimated to be worth tens of millions of euros. As long as it is listed in all loss registers, however, such a request is impossible.
The judiciary has been dealing with the conundrum for over 20 years.
The Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg (Stiftung Preussische Schlösser und Gärten, SPSG) and the Russian citizen Vladimir Logvinenko are still fighting over the painting.
The German side claims that the painting was taken to the Soviet Union in the course of looting. According to the SPSG, ""the painting 'Tarquinius and Lucretia' by Peter Paul Rubens, painted around 1610 or 1611, was part of the collection in the Picture Gallery in Potsdam's Sanssouci Park before it was removed due to the war. Like the other paintings in the gallery, it was moved to the Rheinsberg Palace in 1942 to protect it from war damage.""
According to Russian accounts, the painting hung in the bedroom of a house in which a Soviet officer was residing in 1945. After the officer was transferred, he is said to have taken all the contents of the house, including the Rubens.
Finally, the dealer Logvinenko acquired the painting in 1999 and had it restored. The Potsdam public prosecutor's office investigated, but discontinued proceedings in 2006 because initial suspicion of a criminal offense had not been confirmed. The case concerned gang theft.
The Rubens painting has been a thorny issue in terms of German-Russian relations. Even the heads of state got involved. Hannes Hartung, a Munich-based lawyer specializing in international art law, wrote in his dissertation on ""Art theft in war and persecution"" that ""after the intervention of the two heads of state, Vladimir Putin and Gerhard Schröder, in September 2003, and the confiscation at the request of the Federal Republic of Germany, it had long looked as if a positive precedent could be established through the restitution of an important exhibit."" It seemed like the painting could be returned to Germany.
However, the Russian Federation's willingness to cooperate subsequently waned because ""the current owner insisted that he had acquired the painting in good faith and the Federal Republic of Germany was also unable to provide complete proof of ownership status and the exact circumstances of a war-related relocation,"" according to Hartung's explanation.
Nevertheless, Logvinenko is not the owner, according to the court ruling,
In 2021, Logvinenko then appealed to the Potsdam Regional Court to have his ownership rights to the painting recognized. In November 2023, the court ruled: ""The plaintiff is not the owner of the painting.""
When asked by DW, the Potsdam court explained that the legal dispute was subject to Russian law, as the painting was indisputably located in Russia at the time of Logvinenko's acquisition. The fact that the court was nevertheless able to reach its verdict is due to a legal opinion that was obtained. According to this, the court can now take the view ""that the plaintiff is not the owner of the painting under the relevant Russian law because he did not acquire ownership either through a legal transaction or through acquisition in good faith, and did not inherit it.""

The current court decision from Potsdam does not mean that the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg is the owner, nor does it mean that the entrepreneur from Russia must return the painting. The foundation told DW: ""A return was not the subject of the previous proceedings. Further steps are currently being examined.""
According to the SPSG, the Rubens painting had been ""considered lost since the end of the war. It is one of the most serious wartime losses of our foundation and was long-wanted by Interpol.""
The foundation has no information about where the painting is currently being kept. ""It was last in the possession of a Russian citizen (Editor's note: this refers to Vladimir Logvinenko), who wanted to go to court to establish that he was the owner. The SPSG has opposed this.""
Apparently, the Rubens painting is still in the possession of Vladimir Logvinenko. The Berlin-based law firm Unger, which represents Logvinenko, did not respond to an inquiry as to the purpose of the legal clarification regarding the recognition of ownership and why it took place in Germany.
Hannes Hartung, an expert in art law, explains: ""'Tarquinius and Lucretia' is still listed in all lost property registers. There is the state database 'Lost Art.' There are also private loss databases. A painting like this is completely unsaleable for the Russian owner as long as it is being sought as looted art, as it is now."" The ownership status is also highly questionable because it is looted art.
The lawyer from Munich assumes that the Russian investor has been advised to file a lawsuit. ""Many people hope that they can plead acquisitive prescription, i.e. that the painting was seized in good faith and they therefore became the owner,"" says Hartung.
The currently rejected complaint by the Russian citizen can really only mean one thing: The plaintiff wants to sell the Rubens abroad. ""He needs a kind of 'clean bill of health,' but he won't get one"" from the SPSG, explains expert Hannes Hartung, who once represented the art collector Cornelius Gurlitt under civil law.
The Gurlitt case goes back to a large art find that raised the question of whether Nazi-looted art was among the inherited artworks.
Logvinenko has to bear the costs of the Potsdam proceedings as the plaintiff. He can still appeal. Hartung believes that the art dealer may have speculated. ""He thought that he would be able to sell the painting on for a large profit at some point. That's not possible with looted art.""
Twenty years ago, it was still hoped that an agreement could be reached and that ""Tarquinius and Lucretia"" would be returned to Germany. And now? ""The German-Russian looted art debate is frozen. We had a very open relationship around 2006, 2007. Since the war in Ukraine, the door has been closed and there are no talks between Germany and the Russian Federation,"" summarizes Hartung.
The ambiguity over its ownership remains, and the stalemate may well go on for another 20 years.

https://www.dw.com/en/maestro-pays-tribute-to-leonard-bernstein/a-67641316,FILM,'Maestro' pays tribute to Leonard Bernstein 06.12.2023,"Leonard Bernstein was always good for a surprise. 
When he conducted Beethoven's Ninth Symphony to celebrate the fall of the Berlin Wall at the end of 1989, he had the choir sing the word ""Freiheit"" (freedom) instead of ""Freude"" (joy) in the final chorus. He once spontaneously took his student, the Japanese conductor Kent Nagano, to an art exhibition instead of holding a conducting lesson.
For the charismatic and outgoing Bernstein, life was a dance — quite literally so, especially when he was conducting.
Now, Leonard Bernstein's exceptional personality shines through in Bradley Cooper's new film, ""Maestro."" 
Along with Bernstein's musical successes, Cooper primarily focuses on the maestro's personal life, addressing how his relationship with his wife, Costa Rica-born Chilean actress Felicia Montealegre (played by Carey Mulligan) was strained by his homosexuality.
Just like in his critically-acclaimed directorial debut ""A Star is Born,"" Cooper stars in the lead role, embodying the protagonist in different phases of his life. 
In September, ""Maestro"" had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival. The film is now released in cinemas and will also be coming out on Netflix on December 20. 
While the biopic has already garnered positive reviews, it also caused a stir ahead of its release.
The trailer, showing that Bradley Cooper wore a prosthetic nose to depict the Jewish conductor, stoked accusations of antisemitism.
Historically, antisemitic caricatures have depicted Jewish people as having exaggerated hooked noses, a stereotype that has been used to justify the marginalization of Jews.
Some critics also questioned why a non-Jewish actor should be cast in the role of a Jew, comparing it to Blackfacing, the formerly widespread and racist practice of non-Black performers using make-up to caricature Black people. 
However, Bernstein's children didn't feel the nose was a problem. His 71-year-old daughter, Jamie Bernstein, described the controversy as ridiculous and said that her father actually did have a ""nice big nose.""
Leonard Bernstein was born on August 25, 1918 to Eastern European Jewish immigrants in the United States. 
In addition to music, he also studied philosophy, aesthetics and linguistics at Harvard University. 
Bernstein made his first public performance as a pianist in 1934. Three years later, he met his mentor and close friend, the composer Aaron Copland. 
His conducting career began in 1940 when, at the age of 22, he attended the inaugural festival at the Tanglewood Music Center, the Boston Symphony Orchestra's summer home. 
The film also portrays how Bernstein had his breakthrough as a conductor in 1943 when he stepped in at the last minute to conduct the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall, in replacement of Bruno Walter, who had fallen ill. The critics were full of praise. Bernstein later became the orchestra's music director. 
As a composer, Leonard Bernstein was influenced by jazz and African-American rhythms of the 1940s. He was also interested in Jewish music and sounds from his ancestors' Ukrainian homeland. He was a great musical composer.
His name will forever be associated with his best-known stage work, ""West Side Story,"" from 1957. A first film adaptation, by Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise, came out in 1961; Steven Spielberg also directed his film version of the story in 2021. 
Bernstein was not only a conductor and composer, but also a humanist and teacher. In the 1970s, he explained basic concepts of classical music on television in the ""Young People's Concerts"" series and introduced composers in a humorous way.
Many of the world's great conductors, such as Herbert Blomstedt, Kent Nagano and Seiji Ozawa started out as Bernstein's assistants. 
The film ""Maestro"" is primarily set during the 25 years of Leonard Bernstein's marriage with his wife Felicia, who had found out that Bernstein was homosexual shortly after their wedding in 1951.
To the outside world, the couple initially had an exemplary marriage with three children, but both had extramarital affairs. 
In 1976, Bernstein left his wife. But when he learned a year later that she had lung cancer, he stayed by her side until her death in 1978.
""Maestro"" shows how Bernstein was conflicted by the different aspects of his life; he is portrayed as a man who remained a constant seeker, and who charmed audiences with his wit and musical expression.
Bernstein's children – Jamie, Nina and Alexander – were ""overwhelmed"" by Cooper's approach to their parents' story: ""He chose to involve us all through the process. We were part of his bringing this work of art to life,"" Jamie Bernstein told the press at the Venice Film Festival. ""It was touching to us, his desire to tell this story as authentically as he could.""
The music scenes in particular were particularly important to Bradley Cooper. After all, his passion has always been music, he told the press during the shoot. 
When Leonard Bernstein died in 1990, he was buried with a baton and a score of Gustav Mahler's Fifth Symphony, a work he conducted masterfully.
Conducting Mahler's Second Symphony, Bradley Cooper reproduces Bernstein's style in an ecstatic sequence lasting around six minutes. To achieve the scene, the actor-director took conducting lessons for six years. He conducted the orchestra in real time for the film.

https://www.dw.com/en/will-ramzan-kadyrovs-teenage-son-follow-in-his-footsteps/a-67589901,POLITICS,Will Ramzan Kadyrov's teenage son follow in his footsteps? 03.12.2023,"In the past six weeks, Adam Kadyrov has received more awards and honors than most people receive in their entire lifetime. They include the Hero of the Chechen Republic award, the Honor of the Fatherland medal, and an award for his Services to the Religion of Islam. The 15-year-old was also appointed head of his father Ramzan Kadyrov's security department.
What's more, the teenager has received a host of awards from other Russian Islamic republics neighboring Chechnya. They include one for Services to the Republic of Karachay-Cherkessia, a First-Class Merit Award for the Community bestowed by the Republic of Karachay-Cherkessia, an award for Services to the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic and another by the Russian Republic of Tatarstan.
All honor Adam Kadyrov's contribution to ""strengthening interethnic and interreligious peace and harmony"" as well as Islamic values.
They were handed out after a video surfaced online showing Adam Kadyrov beating a man who had been remanded into custody in the Chechen capital, Grozny. The prisoner in question is 19-year-old Nikita Zhuravel, a man being prosecuted by Chechen authorities for burning the Koran. Police arrested Shuravel in his hometown of Volgograd and handed him over to Chechen officials.
Ramzan Kadyrov — Adam Kadyrov's father — took power in Chechnya in 2007. He is considered one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies.
His father Akhmat Kadyrov was appointed head of the then breakaway republic by Vladimir Putin in 2000 after he supported the Russian army in both of the  Chechen warsof the 1990s.
Nikolay Petrov, who heads the Russian Center for Political Geographical Research and is currently a visiting scholar at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP), says the publication of the Zhuravel video may not be a coincidence. He says it was released on September 25, just one day before Ramzan Kadyrov was received by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""It looks like Kadyrov is setting up a successor and introducing him to Putin,"" Petrov told DW. Adding that ""he has also received recognition from Chechnya's neighboring Islamic republics."" The analyst said this may be a maneuver by Ramzan Kadyrov to find out just how autonomous Moscow will permit him to be.
Adam Kadyrov is not an ideal successor to Ramzan Kadyrov due to his young age, says Grigory Shvedov, editor-in-chief of Caucasian Knot, an independent Caucasus news platform, which Russia classified as a foreign agent in 2021. ""A lot can change in two or three years, there are still three years until Adam comes of age,"" Shvedov told DW.
The abundance of awards bestowed on and excessive attention paid to Adam Kadyrov could be evidence of a psychological trauma suffered by Ramzan Kadyrov, Shvedov said. Especially as praising one's own children runs counter to Chechen tradition.
Ramzan Kadyrov could be making up for his relationship with his father Akhmat Kadyrov, who was killed in a 2004 bomb attack, according to the expert. And while Ramzan Kadyrov's other children will also receive awards, these are unlikely to have any political significance.
It is highly unusual for Ramzan Kadyrov's son to have received so many awards and honors from the republics neighboring Chechnya, Shvedov said. ""This isn't the work of the Kremlin but the product of Ramzan Kadyrov's diplomacy; it is a pretty important signal that his influence has extended beyond Chechnya's borders.""
Ibragim Yangulbayev — son of former Chechen supreme court judge Sajdi Yangulbayev — says Adam Kadyrov first came to public attention when he took part in a mixed martial arts tournament in Grozny aged nine. He was declared the winner, even though in reality, he had lost.
Adam has secured many more victories and attracted far more attention than any of Kadyrov's other children, according to Yangulbayev. ""[In Chechnya] successors are prepared step by step [for their takeover]; you only have to look at Adam Kadyrov's social media profiles to realize he is being pampered like no other,"" the expert told DW.
A picture of Ramzan Kadyrov's son Adam hangs on the wall in the main office of one of the largest construction companies in Grozny, according to Yangulbayev. The company, he adds, is most likely controlled by the Kadyrov family.
""Even in Chechnya, it's hard to imagine a businessman hanging a photo of someone else's child on their company's wall,"" Yangulbayev told DW. He believes these are signs Adam is being groomed as a future successor.
Even so, political analyst Nikolay Petrov doubts these efforts will have an impact. ""It all depends on who is in the Kremlin,"" Petrov told DW. ""I believe that a 15-year-old child with a ruthless and strong father can easily be perceived as a crown prince, but it is difficult to imagine that he will have enough determination, strength and resources to retain power.""

https://www.dw.com/en/nazi-looted-art-is-germany-delaying-restitution/a-66843536,ARTS,Nazi-looted art: Is Germany delaying restitution? 03.12.2023,"Pablo Picasso: This name alone is usually enough to attract attention in the art world. So it comes as no surprise that a Picasso has now become synonymous with Germany's handling of Nazi-looted art.
The painting in question is ""Madame Soler"" from 1903, part of the artist's Blue Period, on display at the Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich.
For the Bavarian State Painting Collections — the state authority which oversees the Munich museum's collection — it should remain here; in their view, the painting is not looted art.
But historian Julius H. Schoeps claims to be the heir of the rightful owner of the artwork. He has said the painting clearly belonged to his great-uncle, the German-Jewish banker and art collector Paul von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy.
Schoeps, emeritus professor of modern history at the University of Potsdam, spent years doing his own research in archives around the world and wrote a book about the case, ""Who Owns Picasso's 'Madame Soler'?""
For him, it's clear: The fact that the painting was offered for sale in 1935 was the result of the disenfranchisement and persecution of Jews after Hitler came to power in 1933. ""The fact that Bavaria claims there was no persecution at all until 1935 is completely ahistorical,"" he told DW, indignantly.
 
It is a dispute that seems predestined for the Advisory Commission on Nazi-Looted Property, founded 20 years ago to make recommendations in complicated cases of restitution disputes.
The hitch? It can only begin its work if both parties agree to it.
""In the case of 'Madame Soler,' the families have been fighting for almost 10 years to have the case referred to the commission,"" Hans-Jürgen Papier, the commission president, noted critically. ""But the Free State of Bavaria categorically refuses. We can do nothing.""
As the commission marked its 20th anniversary in September 2023, Papier called for fundamental reforms, aiming to allow victims of Nazi persecution to unilaterally call upon the commission to make recommendations — without waiting for the museums to give their consent. And the commission's recommendations would have to be binding.
He said they are currently stuck in a legal vacuum, adding that for now, when museums return paintings, these actions are on a ""voluntary basis, and at best, morally-motivated."" But, he added, ""The victims have no legal rights.""
Germany signed the Washington Principles on December 3, 1998, in which 43 states undertook to identify ""works of art seized as a result of Nazi persecution"" and to find ""just and fair solutions"" with the owners or their heirs. Germany is not complying, said Schoeps.
""Germany is the country of perpetrators. And in this country in particular, heirs often despair at how they are being dealt with,"" he said. If something is not finally done, Germany's reputation will be damaged internationally, he added.
He cited the fact that the heirs of von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy have reached settlements with museums outside Germany on several occasions, including the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the Guggenheim in New York.
Culture Minister Claudia Roth, who came to the Jewish Museum Berlin for the Commission's ceremony, has promised that there will be reforms.
She said consultations with the federal states — whose approval is needed in this case in Germany's federal system — would be held before the end of October 2023. A unilateral appeal to the commission will also be possible.
For Papier, this does not go far enough. He has called for restitution legislation. Otherwise, the unilateral appeal would not be enforceable at all, believes Papier, who was the former president of the Federal Constitutional Court. 
The Advisory Commission on Nazi-Looted Property has made 23 recommendations in its 20 years of existence. ""That is too few,"" he insisted, even if the cases in which the commission intervened were groundbreaking.
The commission was successful, for example, in settling a dispute over two paintings by the Italian old master Bernardo Bellotto, known as Canaletto.
The dispute dragged on for 15 years. The paintings had once belonged to the Jewish department store magnate and important art patron, Max Emden.
During the Nazi era, he had to sell them to Adolf Hitler's private collection in a roundabout way — for less than their value, as the Emden family's lawyers argued.
After the war, US soldiers found the paintings, which later ended up in the art depot of the Federal Finance Ministry. For a time, they hung in the official residence of the German president, and later in the Military History Museum in Dresden.
There, they were convinced Emden had been safe in Switzerland at the time of the sale. It was up to the heirs to prove that Emden had sold the Canalettos ""out of a loss of assets due to persecution.""
Maeva Emden, Emden's great-granddaughter who grew up in Chile, recalls the many bureaucratic hurdles her family had to overcome.
The commission eventually recommended the return of the two Canalettos.
In 2020, they were auctioned off at Sotheby's. The work ""View of the Zwinger Graben in Dresden"" alone sold for €6 million ($6.4 million).
""The necessary legal support by lawyers over the years made it necessary to sell the pictures,"" says Maeva Emden. She would have preferred to have made the Canalettos available to the Kunsthalle in Hamburg — the former hometown of her great-grandfather. 
Above all, she says that she wants recognition of ""what Max Emden has done for Hamburg and for Germany. There are so many Jewish families whose memory has been extinguished because they were murdered.""
In 2017, the watercolor ""Marsh Landscape with Red Windmill,"" by Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, was returned to the Reynolds family on the commission's recommendation.
It had belonged to Jewish entrepreneur and art collector Max Rüdenberg.
The 87-year-old Vernon Reynolds is Rüdenberg's grandson.
""What are paintings?"" he asked. He would much rather talk about the loss of people than about the restitution of artworks. ""Works of art can be returned, people can't,"" he told DW. ""I lost my father and my grandparents on both sides. Uncles, aunts — all lost forever.""
Vernon Reynolds, born in Berlin in 1935, survived with his mother — thanks in part to his grandfather's art collection. Rüdenberg and his wife Greta sold what they could to get the family out of the country.
Vernon's brother and sister made it to England on one of the Kindertransports, which evacuated children from Nazi-controlled territory. His mother also managed to escape with Vernon, who was 3 years old at the time. His grandparents Max and Greta Rüdenberg, however, remained in Germany, and were murdered in Theresienstadt. Vernon Reynolds' father died in Auschwitz.

https://www.dw.com/en/no-thanks-viral-app-calls-for-a-boycott-of-israel-related-products/a-67619309,TECHNOLOGY,"""No Thanks"": Viral app calls for a boycott of Israel-related products 03.12.2023","The app appears to work very simply: users can scan the barcode of a product or enter its name, and within seconds they are told to what extent the manufacturer ""supports Israel."" Then ""No Thanks"" is displayed — an appeal not to buy certain products. Videos on TikTok and X show that companies such as Coca-Cola and Nescafé are among those listed.
The app was launched on November 13, and has been downloaded over 100,000 times so far, and social media comments suggest people around the world from India to Belgium are interested in the app.
The conflict between Israel and Hamas has escalated drastically since the militant Islamist group Hamas, which is classified as a terrorist organization by the European Union, the USA, Germany and other countries, attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking around 240 hostages.
According to the Hamas-led Health Ministry, almost 15,000 people have been killed on the Palestinian side since October 7 as a result of the Israeli bombardment of targets in the Gaza Strip. Since then, many people around the world have positioned themselves as either pro-Israeli or pro-Palestinian or even pro-Hamas. According to social media comments, the ""No Thanks"" boycott app was mainly downloaded by pro-Palestinian supporters.
The app can no longer be downloaded from the Google Play Store for Android apps and, as of December 1, there is no version for iOS, i.e. Apple devices. However, the app can still be downloaded in indirect ways.
But who is behind ""No Thanks"" and what exactly is the aim? And why is the app no longer available in from Google Play?
According to the app itself, ""No Thanks"" was developed by Ahmed Bashbash, currently living in Hungary. Contacted by DW, he said he was a Palestinian from Gaza. Bashbash said he lost his brother ""in this massacre"" and that his sister died in 2020 because she did not receive medical support from Israel in time. ""I made it in behalf of my brother and my sister who I lost because of this brutal occupation, and my goal is to try to prevent what happened to me to happen to another Palestinian,"" Bashbash told DW by email.
He compiled the list of companies that allegedly support Israel with the help of the websites ""Boycotzionism"" and ""Ulastempat."" The Boycotzionism website advertises with the slogan ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,"" which is sometimes interpreted as antisemitic. Some see the phrase as a slogan that denies Israel's right to exist.
The lists of brands that should be boycotted, according to the website operators, include world-famous companies such as Adidas, McDonald's, Chanel, Netflix and Apple, and also represent all kinds of industries, from food to cosmetics to streaming providers. Some companies are on the list because they jointly launched a campaign after October 7 in which they condemned Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel. According to the websites, other companies invest in Israeli start-ups, for example, or finance ""the theft of Palestinian territory.""
Bashbash said that he was told the app was banned by Google for including the sentence:
""You can see if the product in your hand supports killing children in Palestine,"" which was displayed on the home screen of the app.
Experts say this sentence can be interpreted as either critical of Israel or antisemitic. Meron Mendel, director of the Anne Frank Educational Center, told DW that the phrase recalled an antisemitic belief in the Middle Ages that Jews murdered children in order to produce Passover bread from their blood.
Uffa Jensen, deputy director of the Center for Research on Antisemitism, also says that this expression could come close to being accused of antisemitism because it uses the image of Israel as a child murderer.
The other interpretation of the sentence is the fact that children are indeed being killed by Israeli air strikes in Gaza during the current war, said Mendel. Since they are not being murdered intentionally, but are dying in the course of the war, the sentence about a product supporting the killing of children in Palestine can also be seen as a polemical exaggeration — ""as a means of emotionalizing,"" as Mendel put it.
Jensen adds that Hamas also killed Israeli children on October 7. ""A sentence like that escapes this context and is then highly polemical,"" he continues.
According to Mendel, the important question is what the exact aim of the boycott is. Since October 7, it has been clear that not everyone is pursuing the same goals: ""There are those who want a Palestinian state alongside the Israeli state, and there are those who want the destruction of the state of Israel. The point here is to distinguish between these two groups.""
""The means of economic boycott, the individual decision not to buy products, is initially legitimate,"" Mendel continues. Moreover, the Arab boycott against Israel is not new; it began in the early 1970s. According to Jensen, there is also a minority of left-wing Jews who are critical of Israel and support such campaigns. The boycott is also propaganda against Israel. Overall, it is therefore necessary to differentiate whether it is a call critical of Israel or whether it is antisemitism, says Mendel.
But quite a few social media users in Germany think of the National Socialist call of 1933 ""Don't buy from Jews"" when they hear such calls for a boycott. But such a comparison could also be seen as historically inaccurate and problematic in itself, as it runs the risk of trivializing National Socialism. ""This implies that there was a specific cause for the Nazi boycott of Jews and that non-Jewish Germans and Jewish Germans were two conflicting parties before 1933. That is, of course, historically completely wrong,"" explains Mendel.
Jensen also finds the connection to National Socialism difficult: ""Internationally, there are dozens of other examples of boycott measures."" He mentions, for example, the decades-long boycott of South Africa up until the 1990s because of the racial segregation at the time. On the one hand, these calls can be compared, but on the other, sometimes antisemitic ideas are also mixed into calls for a boycott of Israel.
Furthermore, the problem that would arise for Israel as a result of such a boycott would not be economic damage. It is the cultural and scientific boycott that goes hand in hand with it, explains Mendel. ""Progressive forces in Israel, in science, in art, in the peace movement, also in Europe and North America, are being marginalized and excluded,"" he said.
This escalation has also been achieved in part through such measures. On the contrary, the overall aim should be to support peaceful progressive forces on both sides.
In the meantime, Ahmed Bashbash's first goal is to make the app available again in the popular app stores. The app is free and all the profits he makes with it are sent to Palestinian organizations that help the people in Gaza, Bashbash said in his app.

The attack took place on Saturday night at the Quai de Grenelle on the banks of the River Seine, which is located near the Eiffel Tower. 
German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser told the Funke media group that the attack was an ""abominable crime.""
""Our thoughts go to the family and friends of the victim, and to the others wounded in this terrible act,"" Faeser added.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said her thoughts were with the family and friends of the ""young German"" man who was killed.
The deceased ""had almost his whole life ahead of him,"" Baerbock wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
""Hate and terror have no place in Europe,"" she added.
On Saturday evening, French President Emmanuel Macron extended his condolences to the family of a German killed in what he called a ""terror attack.""
""My condolences go out to the family and loved ones of the German citizen who died this evening in the terrorist attack in Paris, and my thoughts are with the people who are currently injured and being cared for,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. 
French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin spoke to reporters at the scene on Saturday night. 
He said that the attacker first attacked a German tourist couple with a knife near Quai de Grenelle, killing on the 23-year-old man and injuring the other. 
The assailant then crossed the Bir-Hakeim bridge over the Seine, with police arriving on the scene as he reached the other side. 
Darmanin said the suspect then tried to attack two more people with a hammer while pursued by police, injuring one and causing the other to suffer symptoms of shock.
""After his arrest, he said that he could no longer bear Muslims dying in Afghanistan as well as in the Palestinian Territories,"" Darmanin said of the attacker.
The suspect was known to authorities for being a supporter of radical Islam and had also been subject to close psychological surveillance for mental health issues, senior prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard told reporters on Sunday
According to Ricard the suspect pledged allegiance to the so-called Islamic State in a video released on social networks.

connection with a terrorist organisation.
French news agency AFP cited unnamed police sources as saying the assailant was French-born and a French citizen.
Unconfirmed reports suggested the attacker had shouted the Arabic for ""God is great"" during the attack. 
Three more people have been taken into police custody in connection with the, according to media reports. 
The three people arrested are from the attacker's circle and supposedly include his parents, according to the reports. 
Several European countries, including France and Germany, have issued warnings of a heightened threat of Islamist attacks in recent weeks amid the Israel-Hamas conflict.
France also raised its terror threat alert level in October, soon after Hamas' October 7 terror attacks in Israel, when a teacher was attacked and killed in class. A few days later, the Louvre art museum and the palace of Versailles were evacuated amid a bomb threat.

https://www.dw.com/en/why-maria-callas-is-still-the-greatest-diva-ever/a-67607001,MUSIC,Why Maria Callas is still the greatest diva ever 02.12.2023,"A century ago, on December 2, 1923, a daughter was born to the Kalogeropoulou family, Greek immigrants who had settled in Manhattan. The baby girl was named Maria Anna Cecilia Sofia.
As Maria Callas, she would launch a stage career just 17 years later and become arguably the greatest opera diva of all time within the next decade.
Today, in the centenary year of her birth, Maria Callas is more present than ever.
To mark the event, the world is celebrating Callas. Large and small opera houses are hosting gala evenings devoted to her, publishers are presenting dozens of new publications and record labels are digging out their archival treasures.
Performance artist Marina Abramovic pays tribute to the diva in her latest work, ""7 Deaths of Maria Callas,"" which explores the skillful way Callas performed her stage heroines' deaths.
In his upcoming biopic, ""Maria,"" Chilean director Pablo Larrain reconstructs the real last days of the lonely star's life, shortly before her death in Paris in 1977 at the age of just 53. Larrain has cast Hollywood star Angelina Jolie to play the title role.
The film isn't set for release until 2024.
But just in time for her centenary, a Callas Museum will be opening in Athens, whose conservatory accepted the musical prodigy as a student when she was just 14.
UNESCO included the centenary of Maria Callas' birth in its list of anniversaries, as her audio legacy is undoubtedly part of intangible World Heritage.
And finally, in the summer of 2023, a €2 coin featuring an iconic Callas portrait came into circulation.
""Why is Maria Callas the only singer of a past era who is still present, not only in music, but in theater, film, fine arts and even gossip columns?"" That's the question posed by Eva Gesine Baur, author of a carefully researched biography of the diva published in German earlier this year. ""What allowed her to become unique?""
Bauer isn't the first to ask those questions. Many have attempted to explain the Callas phenomenon over the years.
In 1958, Italian music critic and journalist Teodoro Celli got to the heart of at least one aspect when he wrote that in Callas' singing, ""instinct and temperament merge in an unparalleled art of performance.""
As early as 1953, director Franco Zeffirelli, who experienced Callas as Medea at La Scala, described her impact as ""opera B.C. and opera A.C. — before Callas and after Callas.""
In her fewer than 30 years on stage, the indefatigable soprano performed 47 roles, revolutionizing the art of opera in the process.
Three of them are particularly well known: Donizetti's ""Lucia di Lammermoor,"" Puccini's ""Tosca"" and of course, ""Norma"" — which Callas believed Bellini had written for her, despite the fact that she was not even born until almost a century after his death.
Callas saw herself primarily as a singing actress. Callas biographer Eva Gesine Bauer says that approach allowed her to ""save opera from a gradual demise into indifference."" Callas herself was never indifferent to any aspect of her performance, ""not a note, not a breath, not a gesture, not a character trait of the women she portrayed,"" Bauer adds.
But that explains only part of the diva's enduring appeal. Curiosity about Maria Callas, the woman, is at least as great as the interest in her as an artist.
It would be easy to tell the story of Maria Callas' life through infamous anecdotes and scandals, especially since they have all been well-documented in the gossip pages of the world press: stormy disagreements with artistic directors, bickering with fellow singers, in particular with her main rival, Renata Tebaldi (Callas found comparisons between her and Tebaldi as apt as comparing champagne to Coca-Cola — where she, of course, represented the high-end sparkling wine).
Her chronic struggles with her domineering mother were as fascinating to the press as her marriage to wealthy industrialist Giovanni Battista Meneghini, who was twice her age. Gossip pages reported on her jet-set lifestyle, cancelled performances, angry outbursts and poor eyesight.
Callas was very nearsighted, but was too vain to wear her thick glasses on stage. So directors had to find other solutions to help their star soloist find her way around the stage. Luchino Visconti, who directed her in ""La traviata"" in Milan, had perfumed handkerchiefs placed on the stage so the singer could use the scent to hit her marks.
Then there was a long and, by today's standards, toxic relationship with shipping magnate Aristotle ""Ari"" Onassis — whose marriage to presidential widow Jacqueline Kennedy Callas is said to have read about in the press while she was still his partner.
There was also the mid-career weight loss, from more than 90 kilograms to around 60 kilograms within just a few months, which some observers have blamed for Callas' vocal decline. According to legend, that weight loss was achieved by consuming tapeworm eggs for breakfast, washed down with a glass of champagne. In reality, she underwent weight-reducing hormone therapy, the most modern method she could find — highly efficient but at least as bad for her health as the tapeworm would have been.
Maria Callas died alone in her Paris apartment, leaving behind an estate containing some 40 mink coats, 250 cashmere sweaters, countless handbags and several drawers of full-length velvet gloves, many never worn.
But does collecting all these anecdotes bring one any closer to understanding why Maria Callas remains such a phenomenon? ""Of course not,"" says biographer Eva Gesine Bauer, who adds that all the rumors and legends tend to present Callas as a victim of her overbearing mother, of sensationalistic reporters, of a faithless lover. But Bauer says that gives a skewed picture of this remarkable woman, who was never a victim, neither on stage or off.
She exercised self-determination in her life just as she did in her singing — decisive and assured down to the most subtle vocal nuance.
""In a way, she is the most modern of all women,"" wrote Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini about Callas. ""But inside her lives a woman of antiquity, strange, mysterious and magical, which triggers terrible conflicts within her.""
The wild, the imperfect and the broken are what takes Maria Callas from the minutiae of her private life and the times in which she lived and makes her what she was and still is — one of the greatest artists of all time.

""This prize means a lot, and it means more work because if we have been recognized with this award, we need to move and continue serving our communities,"" Sally Mboumien, one of the recipients, told DW in Berlin.

Mboumien is from the northwest region of Cameroon where separatists have been fighting to create an autonomous state since 2016.
At least 6,000 people have died in the conflict, according to the International Crisis Group. The United Nations estimates that over 700,000 people have been displaced. Human rights groups have accused both sides of abuses.
Mboumien is the founder and executive director of the organization Common Action for Gender Development (COMAGEND), which works to realize women's and girls' rights to sexual and reproductive health.
Her organization also supports young girls by providing them space to speak openly about issues directly affecting them, like productive health.
Esther Omam has worked in development cooperation and humanitarian aid in Cameroon for over 20 years. Among other things, she has worked for the United Nations and held leading positions in civil society organizations.

Omam is currently the director of the non-governmental organization Reach Out Cameroon and a member of the Council of the Wise of the Women's Peace Platform.
Marthe Wandou has been committed to the fight for women's and children's rights for over 30 years and is one of the laureates of the Right Livelihood Award 2021. In their acceptance speech, the recipients vowed to respond to governance issues affecting their communities.
""We are going to encourage more girls and women not to look at their sexuality as a setback but rather something that should empower them to serve their communities.""
""Women's work is usually difficult because of the polemics around what it entails. Therefore, the award is a recognition of the efforts Cameroonian women have been deploying when responding to the multiple crises in our communities,"" Mboumien told DW.
German Bundestag Vice President Katrin Göring-Eckardt has praised the work that the 1st National Women's Convention for Peace in Cameroon has been undertaking since the onset of the Cameroon crisis.
""The award is a recognition of your commitment to promote peace in your country, Cameroon,"" Göring-Eckardt told the Cameroonian women while handing over the prize at a ceremony in Berlin on November 30, 
""Today you receive the prize, and I want to thank you for your resilience despite the ongoing conflict in your country and the hardships that you endure.""
In an interview with DW, German Africa Foundation Secretary General Sabine Odhiambo said: ""The jury decided to award this year's German Africa Prize to the 1st National Women's Convention for Peace for its significant contribution to conflict resolution in four different regions of the country.""
Mboumien, the prizewinner from the northwest region, told DW what it is like for women in the English-speaking part of Cameroon.
""The women in Bamenda normally do subsistence farming and party trade to feed their families. As a result of the conflict, the women have gained more responsibilities and therefore have multiple roles to play,"" she said.
Women in the region often face gender-based violence.

""Because part of war dynamics is to show supremacy, the women in conflict regions are often molested by warring parties,"" Mboumien told DW.
Mboumien's organization supports and encourages young women to speak openly about issues that affect them directly.
""We try to push these women to bring their voices into spaces where discussions are taking place and discuss their sexuality. And, reproductive health rights can be respected because we realize it is a core issue that they need to be addressing if they are to attain their full potential,"" she said.
""At the moment, I encourage young girls to engage municipal authorities so they can extend health services to their communities, especially the family planning units and the use of contraception in the country.""
In their acceptance speech, the German-Africa Prize 2023 recipients vowed to respond to governance issues affecting their communities: ""We are going to encourage more girls and women not to look at their sexuality as a setback but rather something that should empower them to serve their communities.""
Past recipients of the German-Africa Prize include Sikhulile Moyo and Tulio de Oliveira, two scientists in South Africa who discovered the COVID-19 Omicron variant.
Daniel Bekele, head of Ethiopia's Human Rights Commission, won the prize in 2021 for championing human rights at the peak of the war between Ethiopian forces backed by Eritrean soldiers and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).
In 2020, Somali-Canadian peace activist Ilwad Elman was awarded the prize for her project to reintegrate child soldiers and civil war orphans back into Somali society.
The German Africa Foundation has been committed to strengthening relations between Germany and Africa for 45 years.

https://www.dw.com/en/female-arab-filmmakers-biggest-challenge-western-preconceptions/a-67600251,CULTURE,Female Arab filmmakers' biggest challenge? Western preconceptions 01.12.2023,"The mood at this week's Marrakech International Film Festival may have been slightly subdued. Organizers at the 20th edition of the annual festival, one of the largest in the Arab world, deliberately toned down the red carpet glamour and canceled the usual public screenings in the city's iconic central square, partially due to the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip as well as the recent earthquake at home.
But it was also true that the female filmmakers who work in the Middle East and showed their movies at Marrakech had something to celebrate. Overall they're doing very well, perhaps ­even better than their counterparts in Europe and North America, when it comes to representation and gender equity.
""It is not just by chance that there are more and more female filmmakers in the region,"" French-Tunisian director Sonia Ben Slama told DW in Marrakech. ""It's because for a long time, these female stories were told by men. There was a need to reclaim our voices in cinema.""
Ben Slama's documentary, ""Machtat,"" which screened at Marrakech, is a prime example. For five years, Ben Slama followed a trio of women who work as wedding singers in Tunisia, gaining insights into their turbulent private and professional lives.
But there are also less ephemeral factors making female Arab filmmakers more visible and more successful.
Streaming platforms like Netflix are spending more on localized content — that is, Arabic-language content for Arab audiences — supporting women in film financially and logistically, as well as offering a wider platform for their work. This is happening as the number of subscribers to on-demand streaming services in the Middle East and North Africa grows, from around 5 million in 2017 to 21 million in 2022.
Arab-made films now regularly compete at the world's biggest film festivals — Cannes, Venice, Berlin, Sundance — and European co-productions are common. Additionally, many Middle Eastern film festivals and their attendant production platforms now work towards equality. In fact, many have quotas for female-led productions.
In 2019, the Cairo Film Festival became the first Arab film festival to sign an international charter for gender parity at such events. The Doha Film Institute in Qatar has regularly awarded almost half of all production grants to women.
And this week in Marrakech, of 25 international production teams selected for mentorship at the Atlas Workshops, there were 11 female directors and 12 female producers involved. 
""In Morocco, Tunisia and Lebanon, approximately 25% of all new directors are females. In Qatar, nearly 60% of emerging filmmakers are women,"" Fatma Hassan al-Remaihi, head of the Doha Film Institute noted  in a 2019 post for the Wilson Center, a Washington-based think tank. In comparison, according to the latest data from Statista, only 15% of film directors in the US were women in 2022.
In fact, the highest-grossing Arabic language film ever — the Oscar-nominated ""Capernaum"" — was directed by a woman, Lebanese filmmaker Nadine Labaki. 
But even as all this is happening, female Arab filmmakers are facing some unexpected challenges. Audiences everywhere, whether European or Arab, have certain expectations about their work.
""Over the past two decades, the most commercially successful Arab films in Europe closely adhered to specific formulas: stories of terrorism, poverty, female oppression,"" Egyptian film critic and festival programmer Joseph Fahim wrote in a 2020 review of Arab cinema for the European Institute of the Mediterranean. ""In other words, films that ratify Western viewers' perceptions and prejudices of the Arab world rather than defy them."" 
During test screenings of ""Machtat,"" Ben Slama recalls how viewers were quite surprised about the behavior of the women in her documentary. ""I felt they were waiting for the women to be good mothers, or victims, or to adhere to other stereotypes,"" she explained. ""But they were more complex than that. They might not react the way we expect them to. And that's important,"" Ben Slama argues, ""because it shows their complexity, their humanity.""
And then it doesn't matter whether the story is set in Tunisia or Europe, everyone relates, the director said.
""It's about making films that have a universal appeal,"" agreed French Moroccan director, Sofia Alaoui. She presented her debut feature film, ""Animalia,"" at the Marrakech Film Festival this week too. The movie is unusual, a science-fiction thriller starring a young pregnant woman and her wealthy family, psychedelic aliens, stoic countryfolk, the stunning Moroccan landscape and a cast of birds, dogs and sheep all behaving very badly.
""Actually, I never was really inspired by Arab cinema,"" Alaoui continued. ""My favorite films were more Asian, or Danish, or from Finland. So what I'm trying to do is bring the cinema that I love, but in an Arabic way.""
Alaoui ran into audience preconceptions too. Some people criticized the film, she said, because it was not as focused on the Moroccan scenery or village dwellers as her earlier short films had been. It is almost like some audiences, particularly those in Europe, prefer to see an exotic or almost fetishized version of Arabs on the big screen, she argued.
It can be a problem, Tania El Khoury, the producer of Ben Slama's film ""Machtat,"" confirmed. Arab-directed films do well in art house cinemas or at festivals but it's harder to get wider distribution, especially if a director tackles a topic that discomforts Arab audiences and surprises European viewers. ""Then the movie gets stuck,"" she said.
""I have seen female directors criticized by European audiences because they told stories about women that are free, independent and different from what the audience excepted from Middle Eastern movie makers,"" El Khoury noted. 
""The Moroccan film industry is very dynamic and we want to tell local stories,"" added Moroccan director Asmae El Moudir, who also screened her film, ""The Mother of All Lies,"" at Marrakech this week; her unique documentary is Morocco's candidate for the Oscars this year and won several prizes at Cannes. ""Many of us are friends. But we are also very different people and we have different ways of working. That should be accepted.""
""Sometimes I think the European industry patronizes us,"" Alaoui said. ""You know, here's a film festival, here's some diversity [from the Middle East], here are the same storylines about emancipation. I find that so boring. But there are so many more of us [in the industry] now. There are so many more options, so many directors. And the world should accept that we are much more diverse than they think.""

https://www.dw.com/en/nft-sale-has-the-market-bubble-truly-burst-but-do-they-have-a-future/a-67599615,BUSINESS,"NFT bubble has truly burst, but do they have a future? 01.12.2023","Many strange things happened in the global economy during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, but few as curious as the NFT boom of 2021.
Barely anyone knew what a non-fungible token (NFT) was at the start of that year. By the end of it, more than $40 billion (€36.6 billion) had been spent on blockchain-recorded digital assets and artwork. That made the sector almost as valuable as the global art market itself.
If 2021 was the boom, then 2022 was the bust. In January 2022, the market reached its dizzying height but by September of that year, trading volumes had fallen by a gigantic 97%.
The NFT crash was part of the wider cryptocurrency sector wipeout, which saw an astonishing $2 trillion loss of value.
So, are NFTs simply dead, or is there some kind of future for them?
In early November 2023, OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, announced it was laying off half its workforce. Then there was a bizarre event at a promotional event in Hong Kong for the ""Bored Ape Yacht Club,"" one of the best-known NFT collections. Dozens of people reported ""severe eye burn"" after attending the event, which featured heavy use of ultraviolet lighting.
None of that is good news yet there have also been signs recently of a very modest revival in the battered sector, with trading volumes edging up recently after falling steadily throughout 2023.
When the NFT boom took off in the summer of 2021, Andrea Barbon was one of the many people intrigued by the potential of the new innovation.
He quickly created and sold his own collection, a set of computer-generated fractal images.
""This venture sparked in me a profound curiosity and the willingness to delve deeper into NFTs,"" Barbon, a finance professor at the University of St Gallen in Switzerland  and the HSG Center for Financial Services Innovation, told DW.
""My fascination with the blend of art, technology and finance that NFTs represent motivated me to study them in extensive detail, exploring their potential impact on various sectors and their role in the future of digital ownership and creativity.""
From the start, many were dismissive of NFTs. Bill Gates famously said they were ""100% based on the 'greater fool theory'"" — the idea that one can make money through the purchase of overvalued, fundamentally worthless assets  as long as there is a ""greater fool"" who will come along and pay even more.
""Obviously, expensive digital images of monkeys are going to improve the world immensely,"" Gates joked in an apparent reference to the Bored Ape collection.
Yet NFTs took off. Perhaps the unique circumstances of the time, when the pandemic meant people around the world were spending unusual amounts of time online and at home, played a part.
Barbon says the cryptocurrency boom, in full flow in 2021, fueled excitement in NFTs while user-friendly platforms such as OpenSea made it very easy for people to buy and trade them.
Then there was the exclusivity factor, cultivated by celebrity purchases and the creation of NFT clubs.
""The allure of NFTs was further amplified by their novelty, the promise of high returns and their role as status symbols within the crypto community,"" Barbon said. ""This combination of technological innovation, market dynamics and cultural factors created a perfect storm that propelled the NFT boom.""
For Barbon and his colleague Angelo Ranaldo at the Swiss Finance Institute, NFTs represented a fascinating field of study. As part of their academic research, they examined more than 15 million NFT transactions, worth around $18 billion, between January 2021 and September 2022. They came to the conclusion that the whole market represented a bubble.
""We observed a pronounced tendency for bubble-like behaviors in the NFT market,"" Barbon said. ""This was characterized by rapid price surges, often doubling within days or even hours, followed by steep declines. These fluctuations offered significant returns for investors but also posed substantial risks.""
Something else they noticed was that some investors showed an ability to consistently capitalize on the market's volatility, making significant amounts of money, while others displayed more reckless behavior.
""The market experienced inflated valuations driven more by speculative fervor than underlying fundamentals,"" he found.
Some NFTs have had stunning collapses in value. The Bored Ape collection for example, which became especially popular with celebrities, has lost more than 90% of its value, amounting to several billion dollars. The singer Justin Bieber and the Brazilian footballer Neymar are among those to have spent around $1 million each on Bored Ape NFTs, only to see the value all but disappear.
The fallout from the celebrity NFT craze continues to this day. This week, footballer Cristiano Ronaldo was hit with a class-action lawsuit seeking at least $1 billion in damages for his role in promoting NFTs issued by the cryptocurrency exchange Binance.
As a result, there is deep underlying skepticism about the market. But Barbon says it can still have a future, especially if its returns to its origins as a marketplace for digital artists.
""They are not just a technological novelty but a groundbreaking innovation with practical applications,"" he said. ""NFTs have revolutionized the market for digital art, providing contemporary artists specializing in digital media a platform to authenticate and monetize their creations.""
He also sees other possible uses for NFTs beyond the art world in realms like digital identity and the ownership of virtual assets.
Yet the bubble and the huge losses incurred means there will be a big question mark over NFTs for a long time to come.

https://www.dw.com/en/how-beyonce-became-a-pop-culture-phenomenon/a-64621433,MUSIC,How Beyonce became a pop culture phenomenon 01.12.2023,"Beyonce keeps pushing boundaries and rewriting the rules of the music industry, all while embodying empowered self-representation and Black culture.
Released worldwide on December 1, the concert documentary ""Renaissance: A Film By Beyonce"" not only features the dazzling musical acts of her record-breaking Renaissance World Tour, but also goes behind the scenes to reveal how the show was put together.
Throughout, the film shows how the superstar is the one who calls the shots.
But how did she become such a monument of pop culture in the first place?
Born in Houston, Texas, on September 4, 1981, Beyonce Giselle Knowles won her first school talent show at age 7.
Two years later, she entered the pop world as part of the all-girls' group Girls Tyme.
The band failed to meet expectations, but Beyonce's father left his job as a successful Xerox sales agent to become the girls' manager. They changed their name to Destiny's Child in 1996.
It's with the band that Beyonce won her first two Grammys in 2001, with the single ""Say My Name."" A year later, another one of their best-known hits, ""Survivor,"" also won a Grammy.
Beyonce then went solo, first appearing on Jay-Z's song ""O3 Bonnie & Clyde"" in 2002 and releasing her album ""Dangerously in Love"" in 2003. She was the executive producer of her debut solo album and co-wrote most of her songs. Among them was the exuberant single ""Crazy in Love,"" which also featured Jay-Z. Their collaborations fueled rumors about their romance.
They are said to have met in 2000, when Beyonce was 18, on a plane to Cancun to attend the MTV Spring Break festival. They kept details of their relationship private for years. In a secret ceremony, the hip-hop mogul, whose real name is Shawn Corey Carter, married Beyonce — who then became Mrs. Knowles-Carter — on April 4, 2008.
Today, they are the highest-earning couple in Hollywood history, estimated as of November 2023 to have a combined net worth of about $3 billion (€2.7 billion), according to Forbes.
They have collaborated on two world tours, which led them to break the record of the highest-grossing music tour by a duo.
The Carters also released an album together, ""Everything Is Love,"" in 2018, which explored the ups and downs of their relationship, their fame and wealth, all while tackling issues such as racism and Black pride.
The video to the album's single ""Apes**t"" expressed all of those ideas. Shot in the Louvre Museum, with Black dancers taking over the halls filled with iconic art pieces, the ambitious production gave an unusual boost to the Paris venue. It reached a record 10.2 million visitors in 2018 — the most for any museum in history, according to the Louvre.










Beyonce and Jay-Z have three children. Blue Ivy Carter was born in 2012; their twins Rumi Carter and Sir Carter came in 2017. 
The picture announcing Beyonce's pregnancy in 2017 became the most-liked image on Instagram at the time, gaining 6,335,571 likes within less than eight hours and gathering nearly 10.8 million likes altogether. 
Beyonce's fan base, known as the Bey Hive, is particularly active on social media. Unsurprisingly, her millions of fans also celebrate the singer on TikTok. The dance trend for ""Cuff It,"" off her 2022 album ""Renaissance,"" contributed to turning the single into a hit. It won the Grammy for best R&B song.
But despite having achieved the status of the music industry's royal couple, Jay-Z and Beyonce's relationship went through a stormy phase. The superstar explored that period on her concept album ""Lemonade"" (2016).
Beyond dealing with the painful topic of her husband's infidelity, ""Lemonade"" also chronicled society's oppression of Black women in the US in a way that had not yet been expressed in mainstream media.
From samples of a Malcolm X speech declaring ""the most disrespected person in America is the Black woman"" to references to the mothers of victims of police brutality, Beyonce expressed the rage of unheard people, all while experimenting with a great variety of genres.
""Lemonade"" was critically acclaimed as Beyonce's magnum opus, and was also the best-selling album of 2016. 
Her 2022 album, ""Renaissance,"" is not as overtly political, but has also been unanimously praised for celebrating Black musical cultures and subcultures. Through her impeccably curated references to queer-dominated club music, from '70s disco to Chicago house and Detroit techno, she created a post-pandemic bash to reunite fans on the dance floor. 
The tour, which concluded in October, amassed $579 million worldwide and was attended by 2.7 million fans. Now the film celebrates all the work that was invested into the ambitious tour, as well as the community of die-hard fans who have turned her into their queen. 
Through its emancipatory spirit, ""Renaissance"" — the album and now the film — demonstrates that Beyonce is above all interested in promoting self-expression and making music on her own terms. As she says in the documentary, ""It’s always been about using my art and my influence to really celebrate all of our differences."" 
Update, December 1, 2023: This profile was first published for the 2023 Grammy Awards in February 2023, and has been updated with the release of the film ""Renaissance: A Film By Beyonce.""

https://www.dw.com/en/german-court-upholds-wiretaps-of-climate-activists-to-press/a-67583716,LAW AND JUSTICE,German court upholds wiretaps of climate activists to press 29.11.2023,"The Munich District Court on Wednesday ruled in favor of police over their wiretapping of phone calls between the Last Generation climate activist group and its press contacts.
The German court, which issued an order allowing the surveillance, ruled that the violation of the freedom of the press could be justified because of the threat posed by the group's actions.
The court rejected six complaints filed by journalists over the surveillance of their communications with the activist group, which is well-known in Germany for blockading road traffic.
The court found that a surveillance order had been correctly issued by a judge and that the surveillance had been carried out according to the law.
This, the court said, justified an ""intensive, albeit brief, intervention"" by police.
When it came to communications with journalists, these were not classified by the court as the focus of the criminal proceedings.
""The interest in criminal prosecution would result in the fundamental right of press freedom of the press representatives affected as third parties being revoked in this case,"" said the ruling.
Bavaria's prosecutors launched criminal investigations against Last Generation members in May, including police raids at homes and other properties. This received a mixed response in public, with some calling it an overreaction and others welcoming the move.
The probe was launched on the preliminary suspicion the members were involved in forming or supporting a criminal organization.
It follows Last Generation's campaign of public climate-related protests, often involving either blocking traffic on roads or throwing liquids or paint on works of art, and more recently on buildings, private planes, and private boats.
Munich-based daily newspaper the Süddeutsche Zeitung first broke the wiretapping story earlier in June, saying the process had begun in October last year. This was later confirmed by the Munich prosecutor's office.
In June, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said 580 potential criminal offenses had been attributed to the group or its members since the start of 2022, many related either to coercion (usually in the form of delaying people on the roads by blocking their path) or to vandalism or damage to property.

https://www.dw.com/en/from-stripteases-to-sky-burials-the-mystery-of-the-funeral/a-67540516,SOCIETY,From stripteases to sky burials — the mystery of the funeral 25.11.2023,"The pharaohs of ancient Egypt were embalmed, as were several other rulers in later centuries. This includes France's Louis XIV, also known as Louis the Great or the Sun King, and the communist leader Lenin, whose preserved body has been on public display since shortly after his death in 1924. Even today, there are still cultures that embalm their dead, while others bury, burn or dismember the corpse as illustrated in some burial ceremionies below. 
In the middle of the Tibetan highlands, vultures flock hungrily around a dismembered corpse. The ""Ragyapas"" — the Buddhist morticians — have left the body for them to eat. They follow the ancient tradition of a sky burial — when a person dies, they are symbolically fed for a few days while a monk reads to them from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. This is the holy man's way of persuading the soul to leave the body.
On the day of the funeral, the Lama — a title for a teacher of the Dharma in Tibetan Buddhism — invokes the deceased one last time before the body is taken to the burial site before sunset. The Ragyapas dismember the body and split the head so that the soul can escape. It is then the task of the vultures to carry the deceased into the ""bardo,"" the intermediate realm between death and rebirth.
Hinduism also believes that every person is reborn many times. A dead person must therefore be cremated as soon as possible, because only then can their soul free itself from the body and move on. In India, the River Ganges plays a special role in this. According to religion, it is sacred, as it is said the river flows from the sacred locks of the god Shiva. Those who bathe here are freed from all sins. This is also the reason why numerous funeral pyres are erected on the riverbank for the dead. After cremation, relatives collect the ashes and scatter them in the Ganges, accompanied by flowers and garlands. They hope that the deceased will thus escape the eternal cycle of birth, death and rebirth and enter nirvana, a state in which the soul finally comes to rest.
Around 100,000 burials take place on the Ganges every year. Cleansing for the soul, but not for the river, as it is one of the most polluted rivers in the world.
Elsewhere, a burial is more popular, but not all coffins are the same. In Ghana, for example, coffin art symbolizes what was important to the deceased in life: Did he work as a musician in a band? Then the coffin can be ordered in the shape of a guitar. Was he a bar owner? Why not a final resting place in the shape of a beer bottle? There are no limits to the imagination.
Even more expensive, however, are the burial ceremonies of the Toraja mountain tribe in Indonesia. In order for the soul of the deceased to find its way to the land of the dead — Puya — it needs the help of the living. The tribe believes this is necessary because if it gets lost and wanders between the worlds, it can become a threat to those left behind.
After their death, the deceased are first embalmed and laid out in the family home. Sometimes only for a few weeks, sometimes for years, because the relatives save up for a grand funeral feast lasting several days to enable the soul to make its way to the afterlife. The higher the social status of the deceased, the more extensive the celebrations.
Hundreds of guests come together, all of whom have to be entertained and accommodated. Numerous animals are slaughtered at the funeral ceremony, but water buffalo is the preferred choice. For the Toraja tribe, they are not only a symbol of power and wealth, but are also said to help the dead find their way to the afterlife. Cockfights are also part of the ritual.
The highlight of the ceremony is the actual burial. The deceased is hung from a rock face in an elaborately carved wooden coffin or laid out in a cave carved into the rock. There is room for whole families here. In front of the rock tombs, wooden figures called tau-taus, which are supposed to represent the deceased, stand on a balcony.
In the African island state of Madagascar, the dead are just as much a part of the family as the living. And these ""Razana"" have a very special gift — they can speak with the gods. It is therefore a good idea to have them on your side as mediators, as angering the ancestors can cause misfortune and harm the whole family.
However, disgruntled Razana can be appeased at the ""Famadihana"" festival for the dead. Sometimes they set the date themselves by appearing to a relative in a dream. In most cases, however, an ""Ombiasy,"" a Malagasy healer, contacts the dead to determine the right time for the Famadihana, to which the extended family, neighbors and friends are invited. On the feast day, the deceased are then wrapped in precious silk scarves and the living and the dead are introduced to each other. The hosts serve sumptuous food and toaka gasy, home-brewed rum. There is a lot of drinking, laughing and dancing. And when the deceased are then returned to the cleaned and newly painted tomb, they are laid to rest. Until the next Famadihana. As a rule, such a festival only takes place every three to seven years, as it is very elaborate and costly.
Many Asian countries also pay homage to their ancestors. Families set up shrines at home and honor the deceased with flowers and incense sticks.
In Japan, there is a three-day ancestor festival called ""Obon"" every year in mid-August. According to Buddhist belief, the dead return from the afterlife to their homes and families once a year, and they must be given a proper welcome. To help them find their way, welcome fires or lanterns are lit on the house altar in the gardens. The bereaved make daily food offerings to their ancestors, including ""farewell dumplings."" The symbolic feeding is intended to alleviate the suffering of the dead, who may be starving.
According to popular belief, the deceased ride back to the afterlife at the end of the Obon, which is why families make them mounts from cucumbers or eggplants; chopsticks are used as legs. These are either placed on the altar or in front of the door. The farewell is once again marked by fire. Flames in the form of characters light up the mountain slopes while floating lanterns sway gently on rivers and lakes.
The Obon is now a popular festival where almost the entire country is on its feet to greet the ancestors in their hometown.
In Taiwan, relatives like to order an ""Electric Flower Car"" for the funeral. This is a truck trailer decorated with lots of flowers and bright flashing lights, on which scantily clad women dance for the deceased and the mourners. If necessary, a converted jeep will do. Loud pop music blares from the loudspeakers. 
This somewhat strange custom only became established in the 1970s. Apparently, the Taiwanese underworld sensed a good business opportunity at the time. As partners in funeral homes, they simply offered strippers from their nightclubs as part of a cheap ""funeral package."" This would attract more mourners, which would in-turn please the gods. The dancers are also a gift to the dead who enjoyed themselves while they were alive.
In the big cities, the ""Electric Flower Cars"" are usually frowned upon as immoral, but in the countryside, they remain popular.
In Germany, as in most countries around the world, such an event would be unthinkable. Here, the deceased are either buried in a coffin or an urn, moving speeches are given and the mourners throw soil or flower petals into the grave as a farewell.
Afterwards, people gather together for coffee and cake at a funeral reception to symbolize that life goes on. The dead are then remembered on Christian feast days such as the Catholic All Souls' Day on November 2 or the Protestant Sunday of the Dead, which falls on November 26 this year. Also known as Eternity Sunday, it usually falls on the last Sunday of the Protestant church's liturgical year. On both these days, people visit the graves of their loved ones and put up grave lights.
However, the memory of the deceased is present in all cultures, regardless of how it is celebrated.

https://www.dw.com/en/extreme-tension-at-berlins-new-national-gallery/a-67488502,ARTS,'Extreme Tension' at Berlin's new national gallery 24.11.2023,"What is the best title for art created between 1945 and 2000? The Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin is giving it a go for its new permanent exhibition and came up with ""Zerreissprobe"" — translated into English as ""Extreme Tension.""  
From performance to pop art, it is a ride through recent art history and shows the complex relationship between art and politics and society. ""Zerreissprobe stands for the radical upheavals post-1945,"" says co-curator Maike Steinkamp.
And indeed, there were plenty of trials and tribulations in the second half of the last century — political and economic, social and artistic. These include upheavals in civilization such as World War II and the Holocaust, the ideological confrontation between East and West during the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, to name just the most dramatic. They all kept the world on tenterhooks. At the same time, they inspired artists, gave them cause for reflection and often for redefinition. Some broke new ground.
This becomes particularly clear in the exhibition's ""Existential Experiences"" section. It shows how artists reacted with deep uncertainty to the horrors of war and the cultural collapse of the Holocaust after 1945. Fear and inner turmoil are reflected in the spindly, overlong figures of Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti, for example. The unfathomable black holes on the gloomy reliefs by US artist Lee Bontecou cry out for orientation, as does the surrealism attached to the ""articulated doll"" by Dresden artist Wilhelm Lachnit (1899-1962).
The political and military division of the world between East and West, the struggle between ideologies for sovereignty of interpretation and propaganda, provides a completely different test of endurance. This can also be seen in the visual arts. An artistic battle for direction breaks out between figurative and abstract. In Western Europe and the United States, younger artists turn to new, abstract forms of expression. The German artist K.O. Götz (1914-2017), for example, throws paint onto the canvas and blurs it with a squeegee to create abstract, informal structures. The Americans Mark Rothko (1903-1970) and Morris Louis (1912-1962) painted large, sometimes monochrome, color fields.
In the GDR and other socialist countries, on the other hand, Socialist Realism was raised to the highest level. It was supposed to show the toiling workers and farmers as they were; state art as propaganda. But there were also GDR artists who defied the political guidelines, such as Harald Metzkes or Werner Tübke (1929-2004). And figurative art also lives on in many studios in the West, for example in the paintings and sculptures of Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) or Henry Moore (1898-1986).
In the field of tension between politics and society, art finds its role. ""Art often functions like a seismograph in that it can pick up on trends earlier than elsewhere,"" says curator Maike Steinkamp.
A naked Marina Abramovic dancing until she drops, for example, or Rebecca Horn, whose constricted naked woman with a unicorn on her head strides through the landscape, become pioneers of women's liberation. The Neue Nationalgalerie's new permanent exhibition, which runs through till September 28, 2025, shows all of this and so much more.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-activists-launch-black-friday-campaign-against-amazon/a-67540370,BUSINESS,German activists launch Black Friday campaign against Amazon 24.11.2023,"The German artist-activist Peng! Collective greeted the traditional shopping frenzy of Black Friday Week with a campaign aimed at the online retailer Amazon and what one Peng member called its ""Soviet"" business model.
In keeping with Peng's ambition to create an ""explosive concoction of activism, hacking, and art,"" the campaign is a four-pronged attack: A Black Friday protest outside the ""Amazon Tower"" building in Berlin, an online petition, a satirical Amazon-themed ""circus"" created by the Rimini Protokoll theater group, and an ""Amazon Leaks"" page, where the company's employees can report alleged abuses at the company.
But, according to Jean Peters, Peng spokesperson, investigative journalist and veteran of several Peng stunts, the reported working conditions are just a symptom of the basic problem: Amazon's colossally successful business model.
This, he claims, is unique, as it relies on monopolizing access to customers, forcing small retailers to give up huge percentages to sell on its marketplace and, above all, exploiting an army of small subcontractors whose employees have only limited-time contracts and few workers' rights.
There are well-known issues with subcontractor chains: Delivery companies like Amazon, Hermes, and FedEx use subcontractors who often contract even smaller companies. Some of these operations, according to Rory Linton, spokesman for Germany's second largest trade union Verdi, are in fierce competition to undercut each other, and are so small that they only employ two or three people and only exist for a short time. ""They know they can't fulfill the contracts if they have correct health and safety and pay a decent wage, so the big companies get rid of the responsibility,"" he said.
Linton describes cases reported to the union where subcontractors did not allow their workers to turn on the Amazon app that records their working hours for the first and last hours of their shift. Not only that, Amazon stipulates that its ""Freight Partners"" in Germany can only operate a maximum of ten trucks, which, according to Verdi, both restricts any chance of competition and ensures that delivery drivers cannot organize effectively.
""With subcontractors there are almost no checks and balances in terms of workers' rights, health and safety,"" Linton told DW. ""Often workers get less than minimum wage.""
Verdi wants an outright ban on subcontractors in the postal package industry, a proposal that has already been echoed by some of Germany's state governments.
There has been a backlash in the industry. Frank Huster, head of the logistics industry association DSLV, which represents big hauling companies, says a ban would only have a disruptive effect on supply chains. ""Any freight forwarder subcontracts transport companies on a regular basis. If precarious employment relationships are found at transport companies, this must be remedied in the internal relationship [between employer and employee] and not by a general ban on commissioning transport service providers,"" he told DW.
A ban would be a very bad idea, according to Sebastian Hassler, who has spent 20 years running several small and medium-sized logistics firms whose clients include Amazon and other major companies.
""That won't solve the problem,"" he told DW. ""Just because there are a few black sheep, who I believe are a minority — to ban the entire industry because of that! That's my livelihood, and we pay taxes and social contributions and treat people decently.""
He also thinks banning the contracts like the ones he has with Amazon would only concentrate more power in the larger companies' hands, as it would force delivery drivers to work directly for the major corporations.
Hassler says there's plenty to criticize about Amazon: ""I'm also critical of the fact that Amazon has this market dominance, and it's clear that it's getting tougher for mid-sized companies,"" he said. ""And we know that Amazon pays very little tax, and I don't agree with that either.""
And yet: ""If I compare the big players, Amazon is actually the fairest,"" he added. ""Amazon tells us how much we have to pay our drivers, and it's way over the minimum wage. And we have to prove the number of hours they worked.""
He also says that in his experience, Amazon is among the quickest of the big companies to cancel contracts if compliance rules are broken.
The problem with subcontractors, according to industry representatives DW spoke to, had more to do with the state's failure to catch law-breaking companies. 
Marten Bosselmann, head of the German Parcel and Express Association (BIEK), argues that there are already plenty of workers' rights protection laws in place. ""The big package delivery service providers are not law enforcement authorities,"" he told DW. ""We would like to see more controls and the people who break the rules, who don't pay their workers properly, they have to be taken out of circulation.""
Activists, meanwhile, insist that Amazon's market dominance and all-consuming business model — funneling retailers and customers through its platform while keeping subcontractors small — suffocates competition.
""Amazon is a kind of microcosm of a radical planned economy to concentrate profits for a few people,"" said Jean Peters of Peng! ""With Amazon we have a planned economy with total surveillance of all the workers and all the products, in a way the Soviets could only dream of. And all of that is done not for the redistribution of wealth, but for profit.""
Amazon rejects all these claims, saying that it is in competition with several other major retailers, and that its marketplace model actually helps small businesses.
""The fact is that Amazon has created millions of good jobs while supporting hundreds of thousands of small businesses around the world,"" an Amazon spokesperson told DW in a statement. ""We offer our employees good wages and benefits, attractive career opportunities and a modern and safe working environment for all.""
Olaf Scholz's government is drawing up a new postal services law that will apparently include a crackdown on subcontractor abuses. ""Non-transparent sub-subcontractor relationships and repeated violations of labor and social law requirements give reason to expand the legal instruments,"" the Economy Ministry said in January 2023.
Some 30,000 postal workers took to the streets of Berlin in October 2023 to demand action, and Amazon workers have gone on strike on Black Friday before.
And there is a precedent for action on subcontractor abuses: The government moved fast to crack down on meat industry subcontractors after a major scandal in 2020 revealed the exploitation of workers at the meat processing company Tönnies.
Jean Peters is not holding his breath, though. He believes the Green Party, responsible for the Economy Industry, would like to see stronger regulations on subcontractors, but fears that the governing coalition's Free Democrats (FDP), led by Finance Minister Christian Lindner, will try to protect Amazon's interests. ""We'll see,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-series-the-empress-wins-international-emmy-2023/a-67506103,CULTURE,German series 'The Empress' wins International Emmy 2023 21.11.2023,"During her lifetime Empress Elisabeth of Austria was considered the most beautiful woman in Europe. After she was stabbed and died 125 years ago, she became a legend, with her story often adapted into films. One of the latest productions is Netflix's German historical drama ""The Empress,""  which tells the story of her early life and which picked up an International Emmy for best drama series on November 20.
The series, which also looks at the famous love story between Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph and Elisabeth von Wittelsbach popularly known as Sisi, competed against productions from South Korea, Argentina and the United Kingdom. After their victory, the series team together with author Katharina Eyssen and producer Jochen Laube cheered wildly for minutes in front of the global press.
""It's surreal,"" Eyssen told the German Press Agency, dpa, saying she couldn't believe the success of her series. She added that the emotions and dynamics of the family story of ""The Empress"" was what most probably fascinated the audience and jury.
""The depth of characters convinced people. This story is not about a princess marrying a king. It’s about a rebellious young woman,"" said Eyssen in her acceptance speech.  
""We are incredibly honored,"" Laube said after receiving the award. The entire team put their hearts into the making and is now delighted with the great success, especially in view of the ""clever, likable and extremely eloquent competition."" According to Laube, more than 100 million people worldwide have watched at least parts of the series. A second season is now in the works.
Three other German nominees — all of them dealing with Germany's Nazi past — were also in the running at the International Emmys but came away empty-handed.  
Among them was the DW documentary ""Classical Music under the Swastika"" that shows why classical music was so important to Hitler and the Nazis. The film's two main characters represent musical life under the Nazis in very different ways: Star conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler made a pact with the Nazis, while the Jewish cellist Anita Lasker-Wallfisch survived in a concentration camp thanks to her musical talent.
It was the first DW production to be nominated at the International Emmy Awards. The documentary lost in the category ""Best Cultural Program"" against a Canadian documentary about actress and singer Buffy Sainte-Marie.

Another German production titled ""Nazi Hunters"" competed with the documentary ""Mariupol: The People's Story"" about the fate of the war victims in Ukraine. ""Meet Anne Frank"" lost out to nature series ""Built to Survive"" under the category best non-fiction program for children.
The International Emmy Award is a television prize presented by the International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences as part of the Emmy Awards. The award, which honors the best television programs produced and broadcast outside the United States each year, is considered one of the most important television awards worldwide.

https://www.dw.com/en/dw-documentary-gets-first-international-emmy-nomination/a-59820351,FILM,DW documentary gets first International Emmy nomination 20.11.2023,"When 17-year-old Anita Lasker-Wallfisch stood on the ramp to enter Auschwitz-Birkenau, she was certain that death awaited her.
It was December 1943, and she had already witnessed her parents being deported, then disappearing. ""So this is now the last stop,"" Lasker-Wallfisch, now 98, recalls thinking during the ""admission ceremony.""
When an officer asked her what she used to do before being deported, she replied fearfully: ""I played the cello."" Moments later, she was approached by the leader of the newly founded concentration camp girls' orchestra, Alma Rose. ""I was scared stiff, naked and Alma Rose asks me: 'Where and what did you study?' It was an insane conversation.""
This and other stories of the Jewish cellist Anita Lasker-Wallfisch and the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, who made a pact with the Nazis, provide an insight into German musical life from 1933 to 1945. All this is captured in the DW documentary ""Music under the Swastika: The Maestro and the Cellist of Auschwitz.""
This documentary has now been nominated under the ""Arts Programming"" category of the 51st International Emmy Awards that will be handed out on November 20 in New York. It is the first Emmy nomination in the history of DW.
The International Emmy Award is a television prize presented by the International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences as part of the Emmy Awards. With the International Emmy Award, the organization annually honors the best television programs produced and broadcast outside the USA and is considered one of the most important television awards worldwide.
""Classical Music under the Swastika"" shows why classical music was so important to Hitler and the Nazis. The 90-minute documentary by director Christian Berger was produced in the Culture and Documentaries department under the direction of Rolf Rische and Tim Klimeš. Frauke Sandig was the editor in charge and the film was produced by 3B-Produktion Berlin.
In an interview in the documentary written and directed by Christian Berger, Anita Lasker-Wallfisch recalls how the cello saved her life.
She was accepted into the 56-piece orchestra of the women's camp. ""We were children and amateurs,"" she says.
Alma Rose, the niece of Jewish composer Gustav Mahler, who was labeled ""degenerate"" by the Nazis, arranged pieces for the ragtag musical troupe herself. Marches were especially in demand; the orchestra played for the workers at the gate of the women's camp each morning and evening, even in freezing cold weather.
Although the cellist was spared from doing punitive manual labor, she did not feel safe. ""They won't send us to the gas chamber only as long as they want music. It's just a reprieve!"" she thought.
But why did the Nazis even bother to play music for the prisoners they murdered? ""This mentality is so perverse that it's hard to comprehend, but it's essential: Music and the arts were used as part of the murder machine,"" Norman Lebrecht, a British music journalist, told DW. ""And the whole of the musical establishment and the music profession in Germany either turned a blind eye or collaborated.""
Lebrecht has been researching the role of classical music under the Nazis for many years. ""Culture was one of the ways to justify Nazi rule in Germany"" — it was a sort of cover for the Nazis, he said. ""They could say, we are a cultural nation, we are a cultural people. You couldn't possibly suspect that we're doing something that was uncultural.""
Hitler himself was aware of the power of music. ""It is certain that music is to be addressed as the greatest shaper of feelings and sensations that move the mind,"" he told the NSDAP Party Congress in 1938.
The cynical reality was that, though Jewish composers and musicians were ostracized and murdered, Nazis such as concentration camp doctor Josef Mengele had classical music pieces played to them by Jews including Lasker-Wallfisch in Auschwitz.
Even Hitler's private record collection is said to have included recordings by Jewish musicians.
The DW music documentary addresses these contradictions and, for the first time, summarizes classical music events as they related to the Third Reich in their entirety.
The film's two main characters represent musical life under the Nazis in very different ways: Star conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler made a pact with the Nazis, while Lasker-Wallfisch survived thanks to her musical talent.
This dramatic period in history is brought to life through historical film footage that has been digitally restored and carefully colorized.
The documentary includes scenes of Hitler at the Bayreuth Festival, Furtwängler's birthday concert for the Führer, composer Richard Strauss at the opening of the 1936 Olympic Games, and footage of cellist Lasker-Wallfisch being interviewed by British journalists after the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where she was deported shortly before the end of the war.
At the documentary's premiere in Berlin on November 9, 2022, Anita's son, Raphael Wallfisch, told DW that it took years for their mother to reveal to her children what she had been through under the Nazis.
He also said that his mother was saddened and worried by the resurgence of antisemitism: ""She believed that the Holocaust had taught lessons to the world and changed it forever, but that is unfortunately not the case.""
""Every nationalist movement tries to spread an idea of how a nation should be,"" said Simon Wallfisch after the film screening. The Nazis would have done everything to subject music to their ideology and to ban anything Jewish.
Even today, works by artists such as the composer Viktor Ullmann, who was killed in Auschwitz, receive too little attention, he added.
Lasker-Wallfisch can still remember the day the camp was liberated very well. The then 19-year-old wanted the whole world to know about the atrocities committed against Jews. ""What I was trying to describe was actually unbelievable. How do you describe Bergen-Belsen? You walk on corpses. It's impossible to describe.""
In 1946, the cellist emigrated to Britain. She did not visit Germany again until 1994. After decades of not speaking about what she had experienced, she has extensively discussed her experiences in recent years. In addition to giving numerous lectures, she also gave a speech on the topic of antisemitism at the German Bundestag in 2018.
Anita Lasker-Wallfisch is not bitter and does not hold a grudge. Despite the unimaginable horrors she endured, one thing was always there for her: music. ""They can't destroy it! Music is music,"" she said. ""It's untouchable.""
The DW documentary ""Music under the Swastika — The Maestro and the Cellist of Auschwitz"" premiered on November 9, 2022 at the Delphi Filmpalast in Berlin. It is available on DW Documentary YouTube channels in German, English, Arabic, Spanish and Hindi.
This is an updated version of an article originally written in German to reflect the documentary's nomination for the International Emmy Awards that will be handed out on November 20, 2023.

https://www.dw.com/en/documenta-committee-resigns-in-wake-of-antisemitism-claims/a-67406086,ARTS,Documenta committee resigns in wake of antisemitism claims 17.11.2023,"Following the scandal-hit 2022 edition of the documenta art exhibition, claims of antisemitism have again surfaced as preparations begin for the next installment of the event, which is held every five years.
After Indian curator, art critic and poet Ranjit Hoskote was appointed to the six-member finding committee to choose the artistic director of documenta 16 — to be held in 2027 — it emerged that he had signed a 2019 statement by the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. 
The Palestinian-led BDS movement promotes boycotts and economic sanctions against Israel ""to end international support for Israel's oppression of Palestinians and pressure Israel to comply with international law."" BDS was designated antisemitic by the German parliament in 2019. 
Claudia Roth, the German minister of state for culture, denounced the BDS letter signed by Hoskote as ""clearly antisemitic,"" a claim based in part on its calling Israel a ""settler-colonial apartheid state."" BDS is modeled on the boycott movement that campaigned against apartheid in South Africa.
Hoskote has since resigned from the committee, and refused to distance himself from the statement he signed — as demanded by documenta managing director Andreas Hoffmann.
Israeli artist and writer Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger also resigned from the committee after her request for the process to be slowed in the wake of the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks was rejected.
Now, the rest of the committee — Simon Njami, Gong Yan, Kathrin Rhomberg, and María Ines Rodriguez — have announced their ""collective resignation from this honorable task."" 
In a statement released on Friday, November 17, the former committee members justified their resignation in light of what they called an ""emotional and intellectual climate of over-simplification of complex realities"" in regards to accusations of antisemitism at documenta. 
This related not only to concerns over support for the BDS movement, but months of debate about depictions of antisemitic cliches in the works of Ruangrupa, the Indonesian curatorial group behind last year's documenta festival.

While the outgoing committee members acknowledged that ""Germany has distinct social and political responsibilities,"" and that ""alarming signs of deep-rooted antisemitism are once again making themselves felt around the world,"" they feared the issue has been ""misused for opinion politics.""
""In the current circumstances we do not believe that there is a space in Germany for an open exchange of ideas and the development of complex and nuanced artistic approaches that documenta artists and curators deserve,"" stated the resignation letter.
Culture Minister Roth responded to the resignations on Friday, saying that ""we now need a credible new start, for which documenta must also be repositioned with regard to its organizational structures.""
In Rajit Hoskote's resignation letter published on November 13, he wrote that he had ""publicly spoken out against the intellectual and cultural boycott of Israel."" He also expressed his ""wish to restate"" his ""highest regard for the Jewish people,"" and his ""deepest empathy with their historic sufferings and admiration for their glorious cultural achievements.""
But he also claimed that criticism of Israel is not antisemitic.
""I am being asked to accept a sweeping and untenable definition of antisemitism that conflates the Jewish people with the Israeli state, and that, correspondingly, misrepresents any expression of sympathy with the Palestinian people as support for Hamas,"" he continued.
""My conscience does not permit me to accept this sweeping definition and these strictures on human empathy,"" Hoskote wrote.
In her criticism of the BDS letter signed by Hoskote, Roth also questioned the federal government's financial involvement in documenta.
Subsidies for the international art exhibition in Kassel, central Germany, will only be provided, Roth said, ""if there is a joint plan and visible reform steps."" These include ""clear responsibilities"" and ""a genuine opportunity for the federal government to participate and set standards to prevent antisemitism and discrimination.""
The federal government's contribution to documenta 15 in 2022 amounted to €3.5 million ($3.8 million), while the two main shareholders — the city of Kassel and the state of Hesse — contributed €21.5 million.

On November 10, Israeli artist Lichtenberg Ettinger, who is based in Paris and Tel Aviv, also resigned from the documenta finding committee.
Following the terror attacks by Hamas on October 7, she said it was not possible for her to participate in the selection of the next artistic director after a failed request for the process to be slowed down. She had not been able to personally attend a meeting of the committee a few days after the Hamas attacksafter she was told her flight had been canceled.
In her resignation letter, the artist described a feeling of being ""paralyzed under rockets"" when attending a meeting via video.
She described ""the details of the massacre committed by Hamas against Israeli civilians, women, and babies ... being streamed on my screen during our lunch and coffee breaks, just a few days after the massacre by Hamas that began the tragic war.""
""The situation in the Middle East is tragic from all angles,"" she added. ""Innocent civilians suffered and died, and my heart cries for each dead on all sides: Palestinians and Israelis. Every life is precious.""

""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,"" a prequel to the original four-film franchise, opens in theaters worldwide this week. 
Based on the 2020 novel of the same name by ""Hunger Games"" author Suzanne Collins, the film is set 64 years before the events of the first movie.
The plot follows the events that will lead a young Coriolanus Snow to become the tyrannical President of Panem (a role played by the satanical Donald Sutherland in the original films).
In the new film, Tom Blyth plays Snow as an ambitious 18-year-old from a once-proud family who is assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), the female tribute from impoverished District 12 in the 10th annual Hunger Games — the bloody battle royal that is the centerpiece of each of the films in the series.
When Lucy Gray defiantly sings during the reaping ceremony, where Hunger Games tributes are chosen, she becomes an instant star, and Snow sees an opportunity to turn the odds in their favor. But, as the movie's tagline says, only time will reveal who is a songbird, and who is a snake. 
Most of ""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" was shot in Germany, with some of its capital's most impressive landmarks standing in for the fading grandeur of post-war Panem. 
Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee is a monumental boulevard that was designed to showcase the prestige of communist East Germany, and from 1949 to 1961 was called Stalinallee, after Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.
Strausberger Platz, an impressive roundabout on the boulevard, can be recognized 30 seconds within in the trailer — with several CGI elements adding to its totalitarian allure.
Berlin's Olympiastadion in Charlottenburg is now home to the Hertha BSC football team, but the stadium was first built by the Nazis for the 1936 Summer Olympics. 
The awesome, imposing building, with its neo-classical columns — a Nazi take on Greek architecture — has served as a backdrop for several films in the past, including the Marvel movie ""Captain America: Civil War"" and the Bollywood action epic ""Don 2,"" starring Shah Rukh Khan.
It's easy to see why ""The Hunger Games"" producers found it a good fit for evoking a tyrannical nation struggling to be free. 
Rachel Zegler posted a picture of herself in costume outside the twin columns of the Olympiastadion's East Gate. 
The Veterinary Anatomy Theater, part of Berlin's Humboldt University, was constructed in 1790 as a veterinary medical training facility.
The building, designed by architect Carl Gotthard Langhans, is now a protected landmark. Since the restoration was completed in 2012, it is open to the public and often used for art exhibitions.
The central building, with its domed and staged lecture hall, is a masterpiece of Prussian early classicism and proved irresistible for ""The Hunger Games"" scouts.
Interestingly, the 2005 sci-fi film ""Aeon Flux,"" starring Charlize Theron, used the exact same location for one of its scenes. 
A crematorium might seem an unlikely spot to shoot a Hollywood blockbuster, but this building, designed by the renowned German architect Fritz Eisel and opened in 1999, is both visually stunning and emotionally evocative.
The Crematorium Baumschulenweg's minimalist modernist style is meant to create a functional and dignified space for people to mourn and say farewell to their departed love ones. For a filmmaker, it can also evoke a near-future world, just a few steps removed from our own. 
""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" crisscrossed Germany to find shooting locations suitable for the luxurious Capitol and the wastelands of the outer districts.
The film shot some exteriors at the Landschaftspark in Duisburg, North Rhine-Westphalia in western Germany. The site of a former coal plant shut down in 1985, the area has been turned into a public park with its industrial machinery — including a 230-foot (70-meter) platform surveying the landscape — open to the public. 
In eastern Germany, the cast and crew shot some interior scenes at the Völkerschlachtdenkmal, the Monument to the Battle of the Nations, in Leipzig. 
One of the largest war memorials in Europe, the monument was erected in 1913 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813. A coalition of armies from Russia, Prussia, Austria and Sweden, led by Tsar Alexander I of Russia and the Austrian general Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, defeated Napoleon's troops.
There were German soldiers fighting on both sides and the battle, which marked the beginning of Napoleon's downfall, is often used as emblematic of the senselessness of war itself. 
Germany is not the only country playing Panem in the new ""Hunger Games"" film. The film also shot several scenes in Poland, notably at the Centennial Hall in Wroclaw, a grand and suitably imposing concrete landmark whose central feature is a 75-foot-high (23-meter-high) dome topped with a lantern of glass and steel.

https://www.dw.com/en/israeli-artists-put-hamas-hostages-in-gaza-in-the-spotlight/a-67367495,ARTS,Israeli artists put Hamas hostages in Gaza in the spotlight 13.11.2023,"""The photos of the hostages are all around the world,"" says Yifat Gurion, curator of the annual art fair Freshpaint in Tel Aviv.
Gurion is currently dedicating all her energies to raising awareness about the hostages abducted by Hamason October 7. And she's not alone. Israel's cultural scene is responding to the ongoing hostage situation with art events. 
In one installation, a long table is decorated with fine dishware; wine glasses and candles set as though for a traditional Shabbat meal. Family members normally gather here ― but the chairs on the square in front of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art remain empty. They are reserved for the kidnapped hostages. It is a gesture intended to express that the hostages are still very present in the minds of Israelis.
Another art project was mounted on Safra Square in Jerusalem: Here, too, it looks as if people should be coming straight back. Some 230 beds are there, pajamas are waiting for their owners, and picture books lie on the bedside tables. ""Empty Beds"" is the name of the installation, which was set up by the organization Bring Them Home Now in collaboration with art students. Together they sang the national anthem, ""Hatikvah,"" whose title means ""hope."" 
Israel is a small country. Almost everyone knows someone affected by the massacre in which Hamas terrorists killed 1,400 people in Israel on October 7 or someone whose family members are now being held captive somewhere in the Gaza Strip. ""This Is Us"" is the fitting name of the art project for which the faces of the abducted have been rendered in paint on canvas.
""It's not a place of commemoration; the aim is to get awareness about the hostages,"" says Yifat Gurion. The art project that she helped initiate is a matter close to her heart and one that she wants to take beyond Israel's borders.
She feels the hostages are being forgotten, as the current focus is on the humanitarian situation in Gaza: ""I really feel a deep sorrow for the innocent people of Gaza who are suffering,"" Gurion says. ""But it seems that the world is missing the point that this is not retaliation and should not be retaliation. This is an effort to get more than 200 hostages free. So this is a very, very powerful and very important message that must be repeated.""
Artists from all over Israel and some from abroad took part in the project. In front of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, they created paintings of the hostages based on photographs.
Some 150 artists worked in two shifts, mornings and afternoons. They were highly focused and almost meditative, as though they were connecting psychically with their subjects.
One artist painted someone with the same name as theirs; another a person whose birthday it was. Speaking to The Times of Israel, artist Hodaya Gilad said that, the whole time she worked on a portrait of 18-year-old Liri Albab, she wondered what the young girl was going through ― and so felt as if she were getting to know her.
It wasn't just the artists who felt that way, but also passersby. There were emotional moments when people recognized friends or family members in the paintings. The square in front of the museum was unofficially renamed The Kidnapped and Missing Square.
""We said the aim is not to have any kind of exhibition,"" says Gurion. ""We don't think it's the right thing to do with portraits of these people. We want to give [them to] the hostages themselves as gifts when they come back.""
""This Is Us"" is meant to be a sign of hope. Gurion is now storing the paintings at her home and uploading photos of them online.
""Social media are a very powerful tool to spread around and to make the project public in the world,"" she says.
Gurion continues to draw hope that the hostages will be released. ""Right now, these times are dark. It's very hard to hang on to hope, it is hard. It's maybe even unnatural,"" she says. ""But we don't have a choice.""
Gurion says she grew up with stories of pioneers who came to Israel from Germany, Russia and other countries. ""Not that they had much choice. Whoever didn't come to Israel was killed in the Holocaust. They came here, and I was born and raised in Israel. This is where I raise my children. These are my friends and family. When I see what happens around the world with the hatred of Jews and of Israel, it gives me the idea that we really have no other place.""
Yifat Gurion does hope there will one day be peace and an end to the cycle of violence. In the meantime, she and others are committing tireless energy into bringing the hostages home, at least symbolically.

https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-says-goodbye-to-its-east-german-trains/a-67343633,OFFBEAT,Berlin says goodbye to its East German trains 12.11.2023,"Berliners used to call them ""Coke Cans"": The Model Series 485 trains spent decades faithfully clacking along the tracks on Berlin's S-Bahn rapid transit system. Now the last 22 of the old trains — originally commissioned and built in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) back when a wall divided Berlin, and Germany, into East and West — are on their way out.
On November 12, the old 485s will take their last runs through the city before being retired. 
Germany is actually modernizing the entire Deutsche Bahn rail network as part of a move to make train travel more energy efficient and help its climate targets.
The moves can't come soon enough for long-suffering Deutsche Bahn customers, who complain that Germany's reputation for good trains that run on time has been suffering for some time now, with frequent delays and cancellations and an antiquated rolling stock of slow cars that too often break down.  
But back in the 1970s, when East Germany's Deutsche Reichsbahn first commissioned them from a factory in Hennigsdorf, north-west of Berlin, the ""Coke Can"" trains were cutting-edge technology.
Registered in East Berlin as the 270 series (they were rebranded 485s after moving west), the cars boasted a light aluminum shell and a state-of-the-art braking system was set up to recover energy and generate electricity to help power the train.
The new models did a few test runs in the late 1980s but, by the time a full fleet was ready to roll, it was early 1990. The Berlin Wall had fallen and the process of German reunification was well underway. The freshly-lacquered cars had the run, not just of Berlin's eastern sector, but of the entire city. 
The fleet has gone through a few changes since then including a change in style, as, starting from 2002, the cars' bright crimson hue gave way to the Berlin S-Bahn's iconic burgundy red and ocher combo. But beyond the aesthetic changes, the Model 485 has proven remarkably robust. Berlin originally planned to phase them out in the mid-2000s but only truly began replacing them with the new 483 and 484 models last year. 
The old 485s have much weaker motors than the new models, as well a few design flaws, like an air-cooled ventilation system vulnerable to snowflakes, which could slip through slots and melt, damaging electronic components.
Newer trains use separate channels to cool the electronics in the undercarriage, protecting them from outside weather. New models are also more wheelchair accessible. The 485 models left a small gap between platform and train while the newer versions sit flush with station platforms. 
The final death knell for the 485 came with the introduction of a remote control train safety system that made it easier to monitor speed and brake in emergencies. The old trains were incompatible with the new system, so the old models had to go.
Aesthetically, the 485 is showing its age. Blocky with flat slated windshields in the driver's car, the trains have a throwback look compared to the curved high-tech elegance of the new 484 series, which the Berlin S-Bahn has compared to a ""speeding iPad.""
""The trains, equipped with air conditioning, modern displays and camera technology, offer greater comfort, capacity and reliability for our passengers,"" said Peter Buchner, managing director of S-Bahn Berlin, announcing the decommissioning of the 485 series. ""After 36 years of service, we can say goodbye to the 485 series into a well-deserved retirement.""
S-Bahn Berlin will be sending the 485s off in style.
On November 12, once every hour from 9:57 am to 1:57 pm, four 485 trains travelling from all directions will meet at Schöneweide station and stand, side-by-side, for a silent tribute. After the five ""rendezvous,"" two trains will leave the S-Bahn network. The other two will take a final trip, travelling in opposite directions along Berlin's circular ""Ringbahn,"" stopping once at Beusselstrasse station before continuing to their final destination at Schöneweide. Planned arrival time: 3:17 pm. 
The history of the model 485 tracks with the transformation of Germany after reunification.
The original factory where the trains were built was named after Hans Beimler, a communist politician and Nazi resistance fighter who escaped imprisonment from Dachau concentration camp and was a lauded hero of the GDR.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the factory, which produced everything from electric trains to household appliances and garden furniture, was split up and sold off. The train division was absorbed by German group AEG before being bought by Canadian group Bombardier. Along the way, most of the factory's employees were let go. 
To commemorate the decommissioning of the last 485s, the Berlin S-Bahn is selling off several hundred seats from the trains, giving the thick upholstered seats a second life as furniture or souvenirs for rail enthusiasts. 
And not all the cars will be scrapped. Berlin plans to keep one Model 485 intact. It's donating it to the German Technology Museum to be part of its permanent exhibit.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-slow-to-take-cte-brain-injury-from-sport-seriously/a-67367317,SPORTS,Germany slow to take CTE brain injury from sport seriously 10.11.2023,"""At least I'm still alive,"" Erich Grau told DW. ""When I go to the cemetery, I think, 'Now they're lying down there.' Six to eight former [American] football players who didn't make it to their 60th birthdays, and they were completely out of it for the last five years of their lives. That's hard to take.""
The now 68-year-old Grau was one of the pioneers of American football in Germany. The founding member of the Ansbach Grizzlies played in the American Football Bundesliga's first season in 1979. He became the German national team's first starting quarterback two years later.
Today, he is the only former professional athlete in Germany to speak publicly about the illness he believes he suffers from:  chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE.
Grau will probably not find out for certain in his lifetime whether he has CTE. To date, the disease can only be definitively diagnosed after death through a brain autopsy. But Grau has been experiencing the symptoms that scientists associate with CTE for over 20 years.
His memory is getting fuzzier and fuzzier. He schedules any conversations with people he doesn't know personally before noon as he can hardly concentrate later in the day.
""I also feel dizzy more and more often,"" he said. ""The MRI shows that my brain is atrophying [shrinking] in all areas.""
His physical coordination is deteriorating as well, he said.
""I know it's not going to get any better. But I'm trying to hold on to what I still have,"" he said.
At the age of 45, the former secondary school teacher first noticed that he was starting to have trouble concentrating and suddenly becoming quick-tempered and aggressive — something that had never been in his nature.
Studies have shown that one's personality can change dramatically during the earliest stage of the disease. The risk of suicide increases and violent outbursts are also possible.
Australian rules football player Heather Anderson took her own life in November 2022 at the age of 28. Philipp Adams, a former cornerback in the National Football League (NFL), shot six people and then himself in April 2021. The autopsies on the brains of Anderson and Adams found that both had been suffering from CTE.
Around 350 cases of CTE have been confirmed in former NFL players. The disease has also been detected in deceased players in other contact sports such as rugby, ice hockey, football, boxing and martial arts.
Their brains were significantly reduced in size. In addition, whole clumps of tau protein were found in the outermost layer of the cerebrum. These tiny protein building blocks stabilize the nerve cells. When the brain makes sudden movements, there is a risk that the proteins will fold incorrectly. This can damage the nerve cell to such an extent that it dies. This can lead to a chain reaction.
Like all neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, CTE is currently incurable. Only the symptoms can be treated.
In the United States, as well as Australia and New Zealand, countries where Aussie rules football and rugby are particularly popular, ""sports brain banks"" have been established. There, donor brains from deceased athletes are collected and studied.
""It would be a dream come true for me if we also had a sports brain bank specializing in CTE in Germany, to which my brain could be taken after my death,"" Grau said.
The German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) is currently setting up a brain bank. Researchers here face a shortage of tissue material, as Germans tend to be more reluctant about organ donations than people in many other countries.
Researchers were aware of the clinical profile of CTE as early as the 1920s. Back then, it was known as dementia pugilistica (boxer's dementia) or simply being punch drunk. Even back then, it was widely thought that heavy blows to the head could cause lasting damage to the brain. Now we know that even repeated minor blows to the head — blows that aren't sufficient to cause a concussion — can have serious consequences.
""If you accumulate these head concussions over many years, they lead to neurodegenerative processes similar to head trauma,"" Inga Körte, professor of neurobiology at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich and Harvard Medical School in Boston told DW.
""This has been established by research over the past 10 years in different sports, age groups and countries. These are robust results.""
But apparently, hardly anyone in Germany is interested.
Körte, who has been conducting research on CTE since 2009, visits sports clubs to inform parents about the possible long-term effects of head concussions.
""At one large football [soccer] club, whose name I won't mention, only one interested father turned up,"" Körte said. ""It's obviously not yet an issue that parents in elite-level sports in this country are dealing with.""
Körte's field of research also includes other ailments such as Alzheimer's Disease or depression.
""It's about brain health as a whole. Can the brain tolerate being constantly shaken? The answer is probably no. Or maybe some brains can tolerate it, but not all of them.""
Erich Grau is convinced that ""certainly a quarter"" of his former football teammates are currently experiencing ""extreme mental decline."" Despite this, they do not talk about the CTE when the guys he played with get together.
""They would rather be the heroes of the past than take these symptoms seriously,"" he said.

To the stadium's gates
Carrying a red scarf
We're roaring the anthem
You'll never walk alone, Hapoel Tel Aviv
(Hapoel Tel Aviv's anthem)
Tel Aviv is a city that is no stranger to graffiti and street art. In the past few weeks, however, many of the city's walls have been covered with names: Those of Hapoel Tel Aviv fans killed by Hamas on October 7.
One of the names written on the walls of the self-proclaimed City that Never Sleeps is that of Omer Hermesh. Hermesh, a Kibbutz Kfar Aza native, was among the club's best-known fans.
""Forever red"" is written on a wall dedicated solely to Hermesh. The club's main ultra group, Ultras Hapoel, signed it, citing the club's anthem: ""You'll never walk alone!""
On the morning of October 7, after Hamas had entered Israel's territory, he posted on Facebook that he had been injured as a result of shots fired at his home by the Islamist militant group but that he had survived the attack.
""I'm lucky to be alive,"" he wrote. ""Regarding my injury, worry not. My hand may be full of blood, but it clotted right away.""
This was the last sign of life from Hermesh. On October 18, 11 days after he was listed as missing, his body was identified, causing shock among Hapoel Tel Aviv's supporters across the country.
According to Uri Maiselman, who knew Hermesh from his many childhood visits to Kfar Aza, Hermesh was known for giving young supporters a feeling of belonging. One way he did this was to provide them with nicknames. At the funeral, people were asked to write the nickname Hermesh had given them on a piece of cardboard and hold it up for all to see. Some 70 people did so. 
""People felt like someone saw them and paid attention to them, that to Omer, they were someone,"" Maiselman told DW.
Lucy Joshua, another Hapoel Tel Aviv fan, said that while she didn't know Hermesh personally, it felt like he was a big part of the Hapoel support nonetheless.
""He didn't give me a nickname,"" she told DW, ""but you had the feeling he was always there.""
John is a match-going Hapoel Tel Aviv supporter who is also a member of Israel's Arab minority. He spoke to DW on the condition that his real name not be used.
""I didn't know any of the victims personally, but in a way, I feel I did know them,"" he said.
The faces, the voices, he said, are familiar to every match-going fan.
""Something will definitely be missing forever.""
We've traveled throughout the country
Everywhere, in every corner,
The heart is red, the name: Hapoel
And again, the melody is being heard.
Instead of football stadiums and basketball arenas, Hapoel Tel Aviv fans had to travel across the country for tragic reasons in the past month. At Hermesh's funeral, thousands of Hapoel Tel Aviv supporters sang their club's anthem. Supporters of other clubs were affected, too.
Some 30 of the club's fans were killed on October 7 by Hamas, which the EU, US, Germany, Israel and others consider a terrorist organization. A few more were taken to Gaza as hostages.
According to Israeli officials, Hamas killed more than 1,400 people during the attacks, and the militant group seized about 240 hostages.
Many Hapoel Tel Aviv fans were among the victims because many of the club's supporters live in a kibbutz, a form of community in which everyone works together, contributing their skills on a voluntary, non-competitive basis.
""Hapoel Tel Aviv is a club established from the workers' movement and traditionally, so were the Kibbutzim,"" long-time Hapoel fan Lucy Joshua explained.
Some kibbutzim affected by the October 7 attacks were Nir Oz, Be'eri and Kfar Aza, where Hermesh lived.
Our home is Ussishkin
We'll never replace it
We love you Hapoel
The Red Devils!
Hapoel Tel Aviv's supporters are known for their diversity, and it's one of two clubs — the other being Maccabi Haifa — that are notable for having a significant number of fans among Arab Israelis. Despite the current war between Israel and Hamas spurring a wave of racism against Israeli citizens of Palestinian descent, the three Hapoel Tel Aviv fans that DW spoke to don't expect the overall tolerant nature of their supporters to change.
""We're strong, and this will only make us stronger,"" said John, also mentioning that many Hapoel fans from the Arab minority joined their Jewish friends from the stands and attended the funerals.
""The love for Hapoel Tel Aviv is all that matters to us, and this will never change,"" he added.
""Hapoel is also Yaffo,"" said Maise lman, thinking ahead to the day after the war is over. Yaffo is the part of Tel Aviv in which Jews and Arabs live together. The area is near the club's Bloomfield Stadium.
""That doesn't mean everything will be perfect because in this country, nothing is perfect, but standing together gives people strength.""
Lucy Joshua agrees.
""For us, it doesn't matter where you're from and who you are, as long as you're Hapoel,"" she said.
""As Omer Hermesh himself once said: We might be famous for being sharp with our words, but we aren't racists!""

His comments on Thursday came on the 85th anniversary of the Nazi November pogroms against Germany's Jews — and at a time when antisemitic incidents are once more on the rise.
Schuster acknowledged that Germany was committed to protecting Jewish life in stark contrast to the Nazi era.
However, he said the community did not want any ""protective shields.""
""We want to live freely in Germany, our country,"" he said.
""Anyone who wants to understand why the terrorist attack on Israel also causes deep trauma, fears and insecurity in the Jewish community in Germany stirs deep trauma, fears and insecurities, must be aware of what is happening in Jewish souls even 85 years after the pogrom night when, again, Stars of David are painted on Jewish homes and when Jewish ships are attacked again.""
Schuster's speech was part of a memorial event in the Beth Zion Synagogue in central Berlin, which itself was attacked in mid-October by would-be arsonists.
Among the guests present at the event were the German head of state, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and the president of Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, Bärbel Bas.

Germany has seen a sharp rise in antisemitism after Hamas' brutal attack that killed 1,400 people in Israel on October 7, which triggered an ongoing war in Gaza.
Chancellor Scholz also spoke at the memorial event and said he was ""ashamed and outraged"" at the recent wave of antisemitic incidents in Germany. He said every form of antisemitism was poisonous to society.
""It shouldn’t matter whether antisemitism is politically motivated or religious, whether it comes from comes from the left or from the right, whether it disguises itself as art or as scientific discourse, whether it has been here for centuries grew or came into the country from outside,"" Scholz emphasized.
He said the promise ""never again"" made by Germans after World War II meant the state had a duty to protect Jewish institutions and communities with the consistent enforcement of applicable law.
""We will prosecute anyone who supports terrorism, anyone who incites antisemitic agitation,"" Scholz said. ""We do not tolerate antisemitism.""
The November Pogroms of 1938 were previously known as Kristallnacht, or the Night of the Broken Glass, a reference to the shattered glass of the many Jewish-owned shops destroyed by the authorities. Those terms, however, are seldom used and regarded as minimizing the tragedy of the pogroms.
On the night, the Nazis killed at least 91 people and vandalized 7,500 Jewish businesses, burning more than 1,400 synagogues, according to Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.
Up to 30,000 Jewish men were arrested, and many were taken to concentration camps such as Dachau or Buchenwald.
Hundreds committed suicide or died because of mistreatment in the camps, years before the beginning of official mass deportations.
The event is seen as a turning point in the escalating persecution of Jews, which would eventually to the murder of 6 million European Jews by the Nazis and their supporters during the Holocaust.

https://www.dw.com/en/the-mystery-of-banksy-the-unauthorized-exhibition/a-67344109,ARTS,'The Mystery of Banksy': The unauthorized exhibition 09.11.2023,"Banksy: Even people who don't care about art have heard the name. The artist whose trademark is anonymity is also considered the creator of some of the most famous works of street art of all time. Consider the kissing policemen, the anarchist throwing a flower bouquet instead of a Molotov cocktail, or the little girl reaching for a red balloon that's floating away.
Spectacular actions like the self-shredding of an artwork right after it sold at auction for a large sum of money have gained Banksy a reputation as a kind of Robin Hood of the art world, a critically-thinking free spirit, a prankster.
It's much easier to see a Banksy work on a poster or on the artist's own Instagram account than to glimpse one out in the wild. Street art is, by definition, an ephemeral form of expression.
To get a picture of this busy artist's entire oeuvre, you would have to travel almost the entire world. Art experts say Banksy has been active in at least 20 countries over the last two decades — and not just in the artist's hometown of Bristol or in London, but also in hard-to-reach corners of the world, for example in Bethlehem and on the border with the Gaza Strip, where Banksy has been spray-painting since 2015 and has run a hotel near the barrier wall since 2017. Or in the destroyed suburbs of Kyiv, using the ruins of war for powerful expressions of solidarity.
But, in some cases, you can stay closer to home and simply go to a Banksy exhibition. As the artist's fame has grown, so have the efforts to place Banksy in a museum context. One exhibition was even authorized by Banksy — titled ""Cut & Run,"" which was held in Glasgow last summer and featured mostly the stencils used to create the iconic street art works. As Banksy described it, ""While the unauthorized Banksy shows may look like the sweepings from the floor of my studio, 'Cut & Run' actually is the sweepings from the floor of my studio.”
Following this logic, visitors to the unauthorized show entitled ""The Mystery of Banksy. A Genius Mind"" are not getting to see the actual ""studio sweepings.” But that's done nothing to diminish the popularity of the traveling exhibition, which has been touring Europe since 2021. It's currently being shown simultaneously in Stockholm, Hanover and Cologne, the exhibition's twentieth stop, where it's been on display since November 3.
According to the promoter — who usually books music stars like David Garrett on Germany's stages, or organizes newfangled ""immersive exhibitions"" about Tutankhamun or Salvador Dali — more than two million people have already visited the Banksy show. The agency says that in Cologne alone, 15,000 tickets were sold within a short time on the opening weekend.
The Cologne exhibition is being housed in an former car dealership, while in Hanover it is on display in a shuttered supermarket, helping to revitalize the city center. According to the curator of the show, Virginia Jean, ""Many visitors travel several hours to see a Banksy exhibition,"" despite the fact that the exhibition does not feature a single Banksy original.
""We deliberately avoid using originals,"" says Jean. ""We don't see our project as a Banksy exhibition, but as a tribute to this artist."" A team of thirty people, including specialist installers, electricians and six professional graffiti artists, set up the exhibition in the empty space in just ten days — a masterpiece in itself.
Visitors get to see quite a bit for their €20 ($21.35) entrance fee: nearly 200 works ranging from street art, sculptures, videos and installations are displayed across some 400 square meters (4,306 sq. feet).
Some of Banksy's most spectacular installations are recreated in fifteen rooms, such as ""The Elephant in the Room."" The animal, decorated with wallpaper patterns, once stood in the middle of a Los Angeles gallery, in a replica 1950-era living room, highlighting poverty and injustice in the world. At the opening, there was a real elephant in the room, as well as a real Angelina Jolie — and maybe even a real Banksy, who knows?
The Cologne show has a room that's meant to depict the artist's studio, featuring a hoodie-clad figure sitting at a table. This tableau was probably copied from one of the exhibition rooms of the authorized show in Glasgow. So it's possibly how Banksy's studio actually looks.
But what does Banksy himself think of commercial projects like this? Does he not care? Is he outraged and only unable to protest because doing otherwise would risk his anonymity? Or is this kind of fairground Banksy show a new prank by the inventive artist?
Fittingly, the organizers want to neither confirm nor deny such speculation. All they will say is that they are in contact with the managers of the ""Banksy"" brand.
And they're directing a portion of the profits to the Banksy Foundation, to finance, among other things, the Louise Michel rescue boat. Named after the French anarchist Michel, the 30-meter (98-foot) former yacht and its crew of ten have been rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean since 2020.

The painting depicts one of the Spanish artist's lovers and muses — French painter Marie-Therese Walter —  seated in a throne-like chair against a blue background.
Walter met Picasso in Paris in 1927 at the age of 17, when he was still married to Russian-Ukrainian ballet dancer Olga Khokhlova. Their passionate affair inspired Picasso to create numerous portraits of Walter. 
The painting is a part of a special sale showcasing an estimated $400 million collection of artworks owned by art patron Emily Fisher Landau who died this year. 

The most-expensive Picasso painting to sell at auction, ""Les femmes d'Alger"" fetched $179.3 million, including a buyer’s premium, at Christie’s in 2015.
Picasso remains one of the most influential artists of the modern world.

https://www.dw.com/en/how-video-games-tackle-the-holocaust/a-65626971,CULTURE,How video games tackle the Holocaust 08.11.2023,"Paris, July 1940. A child looks out of a window. People walk by on the street carrying boxes and suitcases.
""Are we going to flee?"" Samuel asks his parents. ""No,"" his father replies. ""We are going to be brave and stay right here.""
Shortly after, Samuel is sent to his room. He listens to his parents talk. ""It's not safe,"" he hears his mother say. ""We're as good as dead if we stay here.""
 ""We have nowhere to go,"" his father replies. ""What choice do we have?"" 
They have no choice. The Jewish family is torn apart. First, the father is deported, then the mother and finally the boy. All die in the Auschwitz concentration camp.
The video game, ""The Light in the Darkness,"" then rolls the closing credits that incorporates black and white photographs of children who did not survive the Holocaust , when more than six million Jews were murdered by the Nazis.
""I can't get over the 6 million dead. I can't get over it,"" Luc Bernard told DW. ""I remember those who died. I am not just reducing them to numbers because to me they were kind of our families, friends, neighbors and citizens.""
Raised in France and now based in US, the 37-year-old British Jewish game developer created ""The Light in the Darkness"" almost entirely by himself.
It's a project close to his heart that he's been carrying around since 2008. But it took almost 15 years before he could finally release the game.
There are so many World War II games, but none about the Holocaust, he said, adding that changing that was his motivation. The rise in antisemitism around the world frightens him, he explained. ""I think it's just going to continue to get worse. Unless we change the way we do Holocaust awareness.""
For a long time, it was taboo to depict the horrors of the Nazi-era in a computer game. Bernard was considered the ""Holocaust guy"" within the games industry. He did not receive any funding or support from NGOs. He put all his own money into the game and still offers it for free.
Only now, after the game has been released, is he receiving encouragement — mainly from Europe, but also from the Israeli government. In the first few weeks after its release, some 100,000 people downloaded his game, he says.
The more time that passes since the Holocaust, the more difficult it is to create a social awareness of the mass murder of Jews, says Bernard. He wants to use his game to draw young people's attention to the subject in particular, arguing for the importance of reaching them with content instead of hoping they will go to museums or visit memorial sites of their own accord. 
Bernard's own family history was affected by the Nazis. His British grandmother, whose first husband was a German Jew, cared for Jewish children who were brought to safety from Germany to Britain in 1938 and 1939 on the ""Kindertransport"" (Children's Transport), an organized rescue effort for children.
""In the video game industry, if I'm honest, as a Jewish person in the gaming industry, Jews don't really seem to count much in terms of representation. And our history and trauma doesn't really seem to count much,” says Bernard.
Although World War II has for decades been one of the most popular historical settings for video games, especially in the strategy and first-person shooter genres, these stories are usually told from a military point of view. 
The players are either heroic US Army soldiers saving the world from the Nazis or they command troops and recreate battles. But one central historical aspect almost always remains unmentioned: the Nazi genocide of Europe's Jews.
But games influence our cultural memory and color our concept of historical events.
It's problematic for the Holocaust to not appear in games, says Christian Huberts of the Foundation for Digital Games Culture, which wants to encourage developers to have greater sensitivity towards this topic. 
Huberts told DW that, while it may have been unthinkable a decade ago to represent Nazi crimes in video games, there's since been a shift in sensibilities within the games industry.
Now games are criticized for completely ignoring the persecution of Jews or for falsely representing history.
For example, the first-person shooter ""Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus,"" which is set in an alternate reality in which the Nazis won World War II and have occupied the United States, has particularly polarized opinion.
It's a long-standing game series that sparked a scandal in the 1990s due to the high levels of violence depicted.
There are two versions of the game released in 2017 — a German version and an international one.
Due to laws in Germany banning the depiction of unconstitutional symbols such as Nazi swastikas in public — including in video games — all elements of the game that could be illegal in Germany were removed from the German version.
""The result was that Adolf Hitler was called Herr Heiler and didn't have a mustache. And the protagonist's mother was no longer Jewish, but instead was described as a traitor who is arrested and killed,” explains Christian Hubert. ""That means that the German version of the game deliberately disregards the persecution of the Jews.""
These measures sparked a debate that ultimately led to the legal framework in Germany being adjusted. Since then, video games may also show unconstitutional symbols when their depiction serves ""to promote the arts or science, research or teaching, reporting about current or historical events, or similar purposes.”
Studies by the Jewish Claims Conference, which works to provide compensation and support for victims of Nazism, have found that many people in the US, France, Canada, the Netherlands, and Austria are unaware of the Holocaust. Especially among Millennials and Generation Z, many are convinced that the number of Jews killed has been exaggerated. Some even believe the Holocaust never happened.
At the same time, games are the main entertainment medium for more than half of all Millennials. So why not link Holocaust remembrance with games?
Video games are a good way to learn, confirms Huberts. They can make it possible to directly experience not only historical spaces and landscapes, but also how political systems work.
For example, if players are given fewer and fewer opportunities to intervene in a plot, they could experience ""how a fascist political system can spread its power, how rights suddenly disappear,"" Huberts explained.
But most players tend to ignore educational or ""serious” games.
That's why Berlin-based studio Paintbucket Games is taking a different approach. Founders Jörg Friedrich and Sebastian Schulz want to make games that distinguish themselves from common themes.
They're behind the 2020 strategy game, ""Through the Darkest of Times,"" in which players lead a resistance group of civilians fighting against the Nazi regime between 1933 to 1945.
And in the studio's detective game ""The Darkest Files,"" released in 2023, players slip into the role of a fictional prosecutor uncovering real Nazi crimes. The boss is Fritz Bauer (1903-1968), who played an essential role in launching the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials.
""We're not trying to produce software that's admonishing, moralizing, instructional,"" Friedrich told DW. ""We want to create an interesting, exciting, engaging game that gives a topic long neglected in games the attention it's due.""
Video games shouldn't replace books, exhibitions and documentaries about the Holocaust.
But they can be a good supplement and have the potential to reach people who otherwise pay little attention to the persecution and extermination of Jews under Nazism, according to games developer Luc Bernard. 
""There just need to be more games about that period,"" he said. ""Not just war games.""

https://www.dw.com/en/why-is-north-korea-shutting-some-embassies-in-africa/a-67318476,POLITICS,Why is North Korea shutting some embassies in Africa? 06.11.2023,"In late October, North Korea's ambassadors to Angola and Uganda both said their farewells to local leaders, with South Korean media speculating that more North Korean embassies across Africa may be forced to close in the coming months because of Pyongyang's financial difficulties.
""It is clear that they are having financial problems and their international position is becoming increasingly isolated, but it may also be that Pyongyang does not really have a direct interest in some of these countries anymore,"" said Lim Eun-jung, an associate professor of international studies at Kongju National University in South Korea.
""Despite the sanctions, the North is not completely broke, and it is likely that they want to focus their financial resources on their nuclear and long-range missile capabilities, as well as the surveillance satellite that they have promised to launch in the near future,"" she told DW.
Lim added that North Korea is not receiving as warm a welcome in many African nations as it used to.
Angola, for example, accepted around 3,000 military ""advisers"" in the 1970s and 1980s. These troops were tasked with training local troops but also fought against South African forces.
The Angolan government began to distance itself from the North in 2019 when, under UN pressure, it deported nearly 300 North Koreans.
North Korean troops also trained Ugandan military personnel, including in martial arts, and there have been suggestions that North Korean light weapons were imported into the country.
Pyongyang cultivated close ties with Ethiopia and Kenya and was a long-term ally of Zimbabwe, which as recently as 2013 signed an agreement to export yellowcake from its mines in Kanyemba to North Korea. Pyongyang paid for the nuclear fuel with weapons.
It remains to be seen whether international pressure on these governments will be sufficient to encourage them to distance themselves now, Lim said.
""Lots of countries in the 'global south' now see a greater risk in having close ties with North Korea, and they no longer see it as a desirable diplomatic partner,"" she said. ""North Korea's behavior has often been outrageous to the international community and they will no longer tolerate it.""
North Korea has moved swiftly to offset such snubs, however, she said.
""It has got much closer to Moscow for its own survival, which is not unexpected,"" Lim added.
""Immediately after Russia invaded Ukraine last year, North Korea was supportive and now it is supplying artillery shells and other weapons for the war. In return, it is receiving fuel and food, both of which it desperately needs but cannot get from the African countries.""

Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an expert on the North Korean leadership, concurs that the high cost of operating diplomatic missions overseas will have been an important factor behind Pyongyang's decision to close some down, but there are other considerations.
""The North's embassies do not receive any money from Pyongyang and they are forced to earn their own incomes,"" he told DW.
The easiest way of doing that is often illegal, he added, with North Korean diplomats in the past implicated in the smuggling of counterfeit cigarettes, currency, synthetic narcotics, weapons and even rhino horn, often through the diplomatic pouch.
Many countries have got wise to Pyongyang's subterfuge, however, and have made it far more difficult for diplomats to smuggle contraband, Shigemura said.
Japan's Yomiuri newspaper has also reported that North Korea will close the consulate that it opened in Hong Kong in 1999, two years after the former British colony was returned to Chinese control.
The consulate has widely been seen as one of the North's most important overseas out-stations and, overlooked by Chinese authorities, was involved in efforts to circumvent sanctions by arranging illicit shipments of fuel and other banned goods that could be trans-shipped to North Korean ships at sea.
""I also believe the North is worried about more of its diplomats defecting, which has been a major source of embarrassment in the past,"" said Shigemura.
Thae Yong-ho, the former deputy ambassador to London, defected with his family in 2016 and has since been elected to the South Korean parliament where he is a vocal critic of Pyongyang.
Similarly, former North Korean ambassador to Italy Jo Song-gil disappeared with his wife in 2020 and now lives in South Korea, while the following year Ryu Hyun-woo, the former acting envoy to Kuwait also defected.
""A lot of these diplomats enjoyed living abroad and did not want to go back to North Korea, so they defected,"" Shigemura said.
""To the leaders in Pyongyang, that's treason, but it's also humiliating.""

https://www.dw.com/en/gay-games-in-hong-kong-guadalajara-what-you-need-to-know/a-67311150,SPORTS,"Gay Games in Hong Kong, Guadalajara: What you need to know 05.11.2023","The Gay Games is an international multisport event organized every four years by the Federation of Gay Games (FGG).
In its statement of concept and purpose, the FGG says it aims ""to foster and augment the self-respect of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and all sexually-fluid or gender-variant individuals (LGBT+) throughout the world and to promote respect and understanding from others, primarily by organizing and administering the international quadrennial sport and cultural event known as the 'Gay Games.'""
The organizers claim the Gay Games is ""the world's largest inclusive sports, art and culture event"" which stands for ""unity in diversity.""

The brainchild of former US Olympian Tom Waddell and other homosexual athletes, the inaugural Gay Games took place in San Francisco in 1982. Since then, the United States have hosted the Games on four more occasions (San Francisco in 1986, New York in 1994, Chicago in 2006 and Cleveland/Akron in 2014).
They first went abroad to Vancouver in 1990, and left North America for the first time in 1998 when they were hosted by Amsterdam. Other European cities to have hosted the Gay Games are Cologne (2010) and Paris (2018), while Sydney hosted the 2002 Games. The 2026 Games will take place in Valencia, Spain.
The current 11th edition of the Gay Games was originally scheduled for November 2022 in Hong Kong, but it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They are now taking place from November 3-11 with Guadalajara, the second-biggest city in Mexico, added as a co-host.
It is the first time that the Gay Games will be held in Asia and Latin America, and indeed across two continents.
Sports events at the Gay Games are divided into seven general categories: ball games, racquet sports, sea sports, running, mat sports, swimming and table sports.
Within these categories are subcategories including specific sports such as fencing and martial arts, tennis, table tennis, badminton and squash.
Sixteen sports will take place in Hong Kong, while 21 will take place in Guadalajara. Many will take place in both locations.
""This is a huge chance for us,"" said Mexican transgender footballer Noemi Arzate, speaking to DW from her home in Mexico City. ""Firstly, to test ourselves in international competition, and secondly to discover other cultures, meet new people and make new friends.""
Arzate said she never imagined such an international competition taking place since ""so many things were blocked"" for her in the past.
""Imagine what it means to have such a huge event as the Gay Games to make us visible,"" she said. ""It's a great thing to make trans women more visible in sport and take part in this competition.""
The influence of China on Hong Kong has led to restrictions on the rights of LGBTQ+ people in the financial enclave on the South China Sea in recent years.
Same-sex relationships are legal, and a recent judgement from the Supreme Court did guarantee certain rights for same-sex couples.
However, same-sex marriage is not permitted with equal rights and there are no specific anti-discrimination laws for the protection of the LGBTQ+ community in Hong Kong, where there have been massive protests against the government in recent years.
The awarding of the Games to Hong Kong has therefore drawn criticism, but organizers say they hope the Games and their message of inclusivity can help improve the situation both in Hong Kong and across Asia generally.
""We believe that hosting the Games for the very first time here will be a momentous experience and a cornerstone for our Asian community as well as for the whole world. GGHK can bring all of us together in the name of Sport, Fairness, Respect and Friendship,"" reads the official website.
The organizers estimate that 221 million LGBTQ+ people live in Asia, ""a region where there is an ongoing struggle to overcome homophobia and [gain] acceptance.""
The Gay Games aren't limited to homosexual athletes; straight athletes can also take part.
""Everyone aged 18+ is welcome to participate regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity or even training level,"" the website states under the motto: ""Games for all!""
With no restrictions in place and no qualifications required, over 2,000 participants from 45 different countries are expected in each location.

https://www.dw.com/en/tutankhamun-invites-you-to-ancient-egypt/a-63622150,HISTORY,Tutankhamun invites you to ancient Egypt 03.11.2023,"When the child king died in 1323 BC at the tender age of 18 or 19, he had to face the judgment of Osiris, the god of the dead. More than three millennia later, Tutankhamun no longer stands alone before the guardians of the underworld: Visitors can follow him into eternal life in the ""Fields of Laru"" — the afterlife of the ancient Egyptians.
The immersive exhibition, which has its German premiere in Hamburg on November 3, 2023, uses state-of-the-art technology to make this experience possible: With multimedia illusions of image and sound and VR goggles, visitors are immersed in the long-lost world of ancient Egypt, which continues to fascinate people to this day.
It was 101 years ago that one of the world's most spectacular discoveries was made. For six years, British archaeologist Howard Carter had dug up the desert sands in Egypt's Valley of the Kings area, near Luxor, in search of the tomb of the famed boy pharaoh Tutankhamun— but to no avail. His financier, the Earl of Carnarvon, had become impatient, and Carter had one last chance to discover the crypt.
Then, on November 4, 1922, a local boy named Hussein Abd el-Rassul, who was bringing water to the workers, hit a stone step under the rubble. Carter later liked to tell the story that the boy had wanted to emulate the archaeologists from Europe and had therefore poked around with a stick. In the process, he said, he hit the stone surface.
From then on, gripped with anticipation, the excavation team did not stop. They uncovered 16 steps in all and also found two seals with Tutankhamun's royal mark. But it wasn't until Lord Carnarvon arrived from England that Carter opened the tomb's antechamber on November 26, 1922, and the real breakthrough happened.
""Can you see anything?"" Lord Carnavon, standing in the dark passage, is said to have asked.
""Yes, wonderful things,"" Carter answered back.
The men had stumbled upon priceless treasures that no human eye had seen in more than 3,000 years. ""We had the impression of looking into the prop room of the opera of a vanished civilization,"" Carter later described his first impressions. ""Details from inside the chamber slowly emerged from the mist — strange animals, statues, gold. Everywhere, the glint of gold.""
Word of the sensational find spread quickly, triggering worldwide ""Egyptomania.""
Harry Victor Frederick Winstone, author of ""Howard Carter and the Discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamun,"" first published in 1991, writes how the discovery prompted architects to create Egyptian-style facades. Handbags, cookie jars and juice bottles bore the unmistakable symbol of the gilded king's mask, Winstone wrote, adding that even Tutankhamun blouses were for sale and that carmaker General Motors touted a vehicle inspired by the pharaoh.
In the Valley of the Kings itself, onlookers crowded the excavation site. Locals and tourists from all over the world wanted to catch a glimpse of the treasures while possibly grabbing a souvenir. Carter and his team had trouble keeping people away. 
For 10 years, Howard Carter and his assistants meticulously cataloged every tomb artifact. Each piece was photographed and packaged; larger items were transported to the Nile by a small narrow-gauge railway and loaded onto ships. The most important finds are now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and in Luxor itself.
The most famous of the approximately 5,400 objects found is 11-kilogram blue-and-gold death mask of Tutankhamun himself. Carter found it in the coffin chamber. Enclosed by four reliquaries of gilded wood, a stone sarcophagus and three mummy-shaped coffins placed one inside the other, the embalmed pharaoh lay within a 225-kilogram coffin of pure gold. The death mask covered his face.   
In another chamber, a statue of the Egyptian god of the dead, Anubis, guarded a reliquary containing Tutankhamun's entrails.
Tutankhamun's parentage is a matter of scholarly debate. Many experts believe he was the son of Pharaoh Akhenaten, whose great royal wife was Nefertiti. But Akhenaten had several consorts and concubines, and a genetic study conducted on  mummies suggests Tutankhamun was the child of a mistress, possibly the sister of his father, identified through DNA testing as an unknown mummy referred to as ""the younger lady.""
American minimalist composer Philip Glass based his 1983 opera ""Akhnaten"" on the life of Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten (photo: the 2018 staging of the work in Bonn). Like ""Einstein on the Beach"" about Albert Einstein and ""Satyagraha"" about Mahatma Gandhi, Glass's third biographical opera focuses on a historical figure whose radical vision revolutionized his era.










The young pharaoh ascended the throne around the age of eight or nine. At first, he was called Tutankhaton — ""living image of Aton"" — because at his birth the god Aton was still worshipped. Later, when the priesthood worshipped the god Amun, he changed his name to Tutankhamun.
The child king of the New Kingdom of the 18th Dynasty died in 1323 B.C. at the age of just 18 or 19. Examinations of the mummy indicate that Tutankhamun died in an accident, though this is not known for sure.
Apparently, however, the young pharaoh was quite frail during his lifetime. A team of scientists from Tübingen, Germany, Bolzano in northern Italy, and Cairo found out years ago that he suffered from a severe bone disease and malaria, as well as genetic deformities such as a cleft palate and a clubfoot.
The first-ever restoration work on King Tutankhamun's multi-layered sarcophagus has started in Cairo, Egypt. Archaeologists are diligently working to repair the famous artifact, with the restoration expected to take eight months to complete.




In his lifetime Tutankhamun was not a powerful pharaoh. Today the whole world knows his name. KV62, the scientific name for his tomb (KV stands for King's Valley), is still a tourist magnet today. Unlike the treasures found within, the sarcophagus with the mummified body of the pharaoh still rests in the burial chamber. On its walls, magnificent paintings illustrate the life and death of Tutankhamun.
Now all that can be experienced without traveling to Egypt, In the new immersive exhibition, Tutankhamun comes to life and tells his story. Visitors walk with him through ancient Egypt, exploring the Valley of the Kings, the temples, the treasures and secrets of a lost civilization. No one need fear the ""curse of the pharaohs,"" which he allegedly used to protect his tomb against intruders — because everything here is purely virtual.

https://www.dw.com/en/300-years-of-johann-sebastian-bach/a-67212379,MUSIC,300 years of Johann Sebastian Bach 26.10.2023,"
It was 300 years ago, in 1723, that Johann Sebastian Bach took up the position of Thomaskantor, or music director of St. Thomas Choir in Leipzig. So, of course, the city's Bach Festival in 2023 was a giant anniversary celebration.
Bach was the not the first choice of the Leipzig City Counsellors to become Thomaskantor. They would have preferred the very experienced and very famous Georg Philipp Telemann, but they couldn't tempt him away from Hamburg, where he was getting a better salary for a comparable position. Another composer, Christoph Graupner, was also on the shortlist, but he was still in the services of a count, and it would have cost too much to release him from the contract. It was only half a year later that the Leipzig Counsellors thought of Johann Sebastian Bach, the talented Kapellmeister from the nearby city of Köthen.
The big day finally arrived on May 30, 1723: Bach conducted the early mass in Leipzig's St. Nicholas Church for the parish community. He had composed the cantata ""Die Elenden sollen essen,"" ""The poor shall eat,"" for his debut, and it remains one his most popular cantatas to this day.
The work consists of two parts and was written so that the sermon could be interspersed among the music. This may be the reason that the total length, around 35 minutes, didn't raise any eyebrows. You see, there was clause in Bach's contract that said his music should be neither too long nor too operatic, and that it should move people to solemn reflection.
The subject of the Bach cantata ""Die Elenden sollen essen,"" or ""The poor shall eat"" is the moment in the Gospel of St Luke when Lazarus is compared to the rich man. The story is a call to help the poor in order to secure a place in heaven and to practice Christian brotherly love.
Andreas Reize, who is, by the way, the 18th person to hold the Thomaskantor position after Bach, tells us more: ""Bach made his debut with a bang with 'Die Elenden sollen essen.' You really get the sense that he wanted to make his ambitions clear, coming from his position as Kapellmeister from Köthen. There are lots of dance-like movements, an overture at the start, which then flows into this 'lamento' – extremely impressive.""
Bach festival director Michael Maul sees the seeds of Bach's later works in this cantata: ""In modern terms, I would call it a kind of trailer for a large musical series, where – just as in a good movie trailer – you get glimpses of all the unique moments that will then be shown more fully in the film.""
Both the St. Thomas Choir, a boys choir, and the Gewandhaus Orchestra, have deep historic roots in Leipzig. The Gewandhaus Orchestra is the oldest civic (as in, non-royal) symphony orchestra in the world. It was founded in 1743 by 16 nobles and non-nobles and was initially a sort of private concert enterprise. Today, in addition to packed concert seasons, the renowned orchestra also performs Bach cantatas on a weekly basis in St. Thomas Church. They're joined there by the St. Thomas Choir, which is also internationally famous thanks in part to extensive touring. The choir has been around for 800 years, but it's only since Bach that the Thomaskantor, or music director of the choir, has been numbered. He was literally number one.
2023 was the 300th anniversary of Bach becoming the Thomaskantor. To celebrate, the city of Leipzig's annual Bach Festival took place under the motto ""Bach for Future."" They wanted to highlight how Bach remains relevant today and continues to inspire new ideas in contemporary composers.
It was along those lines that the Bach Festival commissioned clarinetist, conductor and composer Jörg Widmann to compose a cantata that reflects the present-day.










Widmann sees his cantata as a journey. It starts by doubting the existence of God and ends by singing of peace and praising God with hallelujahs. This final text is by Paul Gerhard, a poet whose texts Bach also set to music.
Widmann used the traditional cantata form, featuring solos and chorales, but he made it his own by including texts from different sources and by different authors. War and peace were the themes of the work, but Widmann wasn't thinking only of the war in Ukraine when he composed the cantata. Rather, he was thinking of war in general and throughout all time. He explains:  ""In this commission I got from the Bachfest, it was not possible to simply say, 'Oh yes, let's praise God and let's praise Bach and then let's go home.' You know, it's not enough. I think it's really necessary to address these things. Therefore my piece ends with a very short but urgent call for peace. You know, call me naive, yes, probably rightly so. And by the way, naivety in a well understood sense is a kind of precondition to make music, to make arts. So nothing against naivety, in a well-understood sense.
Those deep thoughts from composer Jörg Widmann close out this Deutsche Welle Festival Concert.

https://www.dw.com/en/salman-rushdie-receives-prestigious-german-peace-prize/a-67176807,LITERATURE,Salman Rushdie receives prestigious German Peace Prize 22.10.2023,"British-Indian writer Salman Rushdie was on Sunday presented with the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade in Frankfurt's historic St Paul's Church.
The German Peace Prize comes with a €25,000 ($27,300) payment and is one of the most prestigious awards in Germany. It was first awarded in 1950.
Praising Rushdie in a speech, his friend and fellow writer Daniel Kehlmann described the author as ""possibly the most important defender of freedom of art and speech of our time""
Rushdie, who survived a stabbing attack last year, also pledged to continue defending the freedom of speech.
Previously, the jury said that the celebrated writer deserved the award for ""his indomitable spirit, for his affirmation of life and for enriching our world with his love of storytelling.""
""In his novels and non-fiction, he melds narrative foresight with unfailing literary innovation, humour and wisdom,"" the jury said in a post on the prize's website.
Rushdie was announced as the winner of the prize in June but the award ceremony took place at the closing of the Frankfurt Book Fair on Sunday.

""A remarkable list of people have it [German Peace Prize]. So I'm just very gratified to have my name added to that list,” he said during an interview with DW earlier this week.
By winning the award, Rushdie joins the list with Margaret Atwood, Orhan Pamuk, Susan Sontag, Amos Oz, Vaclav Havel among others.
The globally acclaimed author shot to fame after his 1981 masterpiece 'Midnight's Children' for which he also received the Booker Prize.
However, his 1989 novel 'The Satanic Verses,' saw the late Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini impose a fatwa on Rushdie for blasphemy. The author has been facing regular death threats ever since. In 2022, he was stabbed multiple times at a public reading in the US, leaving him blind in one eye since then.
Rushdie has written more than 14 novels and his latest novel 'Victory City' which was published this year, is about the stabbing attack.
The novel deals with political intrigue and religious bigotry through the tale of the rise and fall of a feminist utopia and ends with the sentence: ""Words are the winner.""

https://www.dw.com/en/f1-academy-driver-bianca-bustamante-on-life-in-the-fast-lane/a-65803526,SPORTS,F1 Academy driver Bianca Bustamante on life in the fast lane 19.10.2023,"Almost half a year after her success in the F1 Academy, Bianca Bustamante has signed with Formula One team McLaren as a member of the driver development program.
She is the first female driver to join the British team's development program, and she will represent McLaren on the 2024 F1 Academy grid and run their livery.
""This is such an unreal moment in my career. To sign with McLaren and ART Grand Prix is way beyond anything I could've ever imagined growing up racing karts in the Philippines,"" Bustamante said in a statement on McLaren's website.
""I still have a hard time seeing my name next to McLaren without getting emotional, as the history and heritage linked to this team leaves me truly speechless.""
In May 2023, Bustamante won her first race in the F1 Academy, winning the second of three races in Valencia.
""When I won, it was like the whole world suddenly exploded,"" Bustamante told DW in June.
The 18-year-old received a message from the president of the Philippines, had a resolution voiced on the country's senate floor and saw her face splashed across an enormous billboard on the busiest street in Manila.
""I honestly didn't know how to react. I wasn't expecting the effect would be this much. It was really a crazy moment for me. To experience all this stuff at 18, sometimes I think it's a bit too much,"" she said.
It would be easy to dismiss this response as classic athlete hyperbole, but Bustamante's journey to this point explains why the tears flowed, and the country celebrated when the teenager stood on the podium.
Her father, a motorsport fanatic, bought Bustamante her first suit when she was just 1. She was in a baby race cart by age three, and at just six years old, Bustamante knew a life in motorsport was what she wanted.
""Financially, it definitely wasn't easy for us. You know, coming from the Philippines, we're a very middle-class family. My dad is actually an overseas worker. He moved away when I was young just so he could support the family and put food on the table,"" she said.
""The fact that I was racing, it was really, really difficult for the whole family. We made a lot of sacrifices, sometimes you might say too many. That's why I've always felt like I've had to pay them back.""
Many aiming to be in professional sports say failure isn't an option, and yet, for one of myriad reasons that make being a professional athlete so hard, never make it. Like them, Bustamante never had a prom or sleepovers and has been home-schooled for most of her life. A lot of what makes a typical childhood has been missing.
""Five, seven years ago, we were just struggling to even pay for the entry fee, fuel, tires. It made for a difficult road, and because of that, I needed to really value every time I was just able to drive, to race because I never really knew when it would be the last time.""
Life hasn't been easy for Bustamante, but one mantra has helped her through: ""When life's tough, you've got to be tougher.""
That approach has helped her go from karting glory as a child to the top rookie in the W Series [an all-female single-seater championship] last year. In 2023, she is set to finish in the top 7 of the 2023 F1 Academy racing for Prema Racing — the starting point for many F1 talents such as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.
To be here is a testament to Bustamante's determination, but even now, on the biggest stage, home remains a long way away. ""Other drivers have a home to go to after the race, but for me, home is a bit too far, so I'm often by myself,"" she told DW.
""There's a lot of moments where you kind of have a crash. You have so much adrenaline during a race weekend, and then suddenly, you're back to being by yourself. It's one of the struggles.""
It's a poignant reminder of the mental fortitude needed when competing at the highest level. Family support helps, perhaps none more so than the bond she shares with her brother.
""I have a brother, and he has autism and Down syndrome. I think having him really taught me how to not only think of myself but to be very selfless with a lot of things because, with him, I've always had to be selfless with moments where I needed to be very patient, forgiving when he would throw tantrums,"" Bustamante said, adding that after her win in Valencia, her brother was one of the first people she called.
""And I think that's why I've always been really, really patient with life, dealing with difficulties, losing, progress, patience just with everything. With that comes a lot of maturity. To not act on your emotions, or what's around you or in the moment, it really takes a lot of self-control and discipline.""
It's no surprise that her end goal is to join the biggest show in motorsport.
""The end goal for me is making it to Formula One. That's my Everest,"" Bustamante told DW. ""Everything I'm doing is to hopefully make it there.""
Last year at Hungaroring, Bustamante got a taste of the big show when she met seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton. The two bonded over the similarities of their journeys, two aspiring drivers who didn't look like anyone on the grid. For the teenager, the meeting was ""a moment she'll always cherish,"" and she credits Hamilton as one of the original supporters of the existence of the F1 Academy.
""Lewis has always supported women in motorsport. He was one of the first few people who really stood up for it and said: 'We need to have an initiative to support women.' Looking back five years ago, there wasn't even an initiative for women in the sport,"" she said.
""The fact that now, it's not just about us drivers, but even engineers like McLaren launching their new women program for STEM engineers — that's amazing,"" Bustamante said, referring to the science, technology, engineering and math courses that lay the foundation for a career in motorsport. The teenager has herself specialized in STEM and was, as of early June, on the verge of graduating.
By securing a deal with McLaren, Bustamante has not just taken a huge step towards realizing her goal of being on the F1 grid at some point in the future, but she's also paved the way for women in motorsports and in the Philippines. Bustamante is just getting started, and the teenager has a lot more to do, including hopefully making more phone calls to her brother after a race win.

https://www.dw.com/en/20-days-in-mariupol-director-fight-in-ukraine-goes-on/a-67098333,FILM,'20 Days in Mariupol' director: Fight in Ukraine goes on 17.10.2023,"A pregnant woman is carried away on a stretcher after a Russian missile strike on a maternity hospital: This shocking image from the Siege of Mariupol traveled around the world.
The reason it exists in the first place is thanks to the Ukrainian war correspondents working for the Associated Press, who remained in the city when it was encircled and extensively bombed by Russian troops.
They were the last team of international journalists on site, covering the first 20 days of the siege that left the city in ruins.
The Ukrainian reporters Mstyslav Chernov, Evgeniy Maloletka, Vasilisa Stepanenko and Lori Hinnant won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for their work, as well as many other awards — including the Deutsche Well Freedom of Speech Award.
Mstyslav Chernov then turned his video footage into a film, titled ""20 days in Mariupol.""
The documentary has been selected as Ukraine's submission to the 2024 Oscars in the best international feature category.
The film, which has also won the World Cinema documentary prize following its Sundance premiere, celebrated its German premiere at Berlin's Human Rights Film Festival, where DW met the filmmaker.
The documentary goes way beyond the news stories using the Associated Press material that was widely broadcast around the world.
""That was one of the main reasons why this film needed to be made,"" says Chernov. ""The impressions you get from one-minute to two-minute news pieces is very different to what you feel and what you understand when you watch 95 minutes,"" which, he says, is still ""not enough to speak about all the tragedies that happened in Mariupol — even the 30 hours [of video footage] that I managed to get out from the city is not enough.""
The estimated number of Ukrainians killed in besieged Mariupol varies greatly; the film cites the Ukrainian count of more than 25,000 deaths.
According to UN estimates, 90% of the city's apartment buildings and 60% of single-family homes were damaged.
Meanwhile, Russia is knocking down those destroyed buildings, and is building new ones ""just to make good pictures,"" says Chernov, thereby erasing the locations that could help determine the scale of the war crimes committed by Russia. ""There is less and less evidence left with every every single day that passes by.""
""20 Day in Mariupol"" portrays not only from the inside how a modern European city was bombed to ruins, how children fell victim to the missiles and how mass graves had to be created to bury thousands of bodies, but also provides a reminder of how Russia framed the events.
At the beginning of the film, Vladimir Putin is shown stating in a televised speech at the launch of the invasion that his ""special military operation"" is absolutely necessary, because otherwise Russia would be attacked first. As one Mariupol resident puts it sarcastically in the film, the Russian leader was ""beautifully, so beautifully"" deceptive in his speech.
This reminder that the whole conflict is based on Putin's lies makes the images of its bloody impact even more painful to watch.
As the medical team in the hospital where the Associated Press journalists were based desperately tried to revive a toddler badly wounded by Russian shells, or operate a teenager whose legs were blown off while playing soccer, the head surgeon encourages Chernov to film every gory detail: ""Show that Putin bastard the eyes of this child!"" he yells. ""Show what these motherf**kers are doing to civilians!""
As Chernov states in the film's narration: ""This is painful to watch but it must be painful to watch.""
The Ukrainian reporters managed to send their reports to Western media at the risk of their lives, as they often had to reach uncovered spots where WiFi might still be available.
But Russia was quick to label the images as ""fake news.""
As they were released, the Russian Embassy in London tweeted that that the pregnant woman shown in the AP photos was an actress. The documentary also shows a clip of a British journalist confronting the Kremlin's ambassador to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, with Chernov's footage; the diplomat brushes off the question about the killing of babies as ""information wars.""
""It's impossible to tell the story of Mariupol completely without telling how much misinformation and misinterpretation is connected to it,"" Chernov tells DW. As we discuss the topic of war reporting, the filmmaker however stresses that his film is not about journalists: ""It's the story of my people, who were trapped, killed, lost their homes,"" says the director who was born in Kharkiv, another border city that was hard hit by the Russians.
Nevertheless, ""20 Days in Mariupol"" also chronicles a modern-age phenomenon that is harming the work of journalists globally, as fake news is contaminating the coverage of all contested issues — as is currently the case in the war between terrorist group Hamas and Israel.
Asked if he's worried that the world will start forgetting the Ukrainians as the Middle East flares up, the war reporter realistically points out: ""The shifting of the media's attention was inevitable. We work in the news. We know that attention shifts and comes back later."" Chernov is also well aware that both conflicts are geopolitically connected.
But, he adds, some parts of European society are mistaken in their belief that if only weapons were no longer delivered to Ukraine, war would stop and peace negotiations would happen: ""I don't think that a shift in international support for Ukraine will stop the fight. Ukrainians are fighting for their survival. So it just means that more Ukrainians will die, because nobody will watch, nobody will help.""
The 2023 Human Rights Film Festival Berlin is held from October 11-22.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will announce the films on the 2024 Oscar shortlist on December 21, and its final five nominees on January 23, 2024.

https://www.dw.com/en/after-hamas-attacks-cultural-scene-remained-widely-silent-on-israel/a-67106376,CULTURE,"After Hamas attacks, cultural scene remained widely silent on Israel 16.10.2023","Immediately after the large-scale terrorist attacks on Israel by the militant Islamist Hamas, numerous Hollywood stars and other cultural figures in the US expressed their solidarity with the country under the hashtag #standwithisrael.
On October 12, 700 Hollywood stars, including actors Gal Gadot, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Douglas and Chris Pine, as well as comedians Jerry Seinfeld and Amy Schumer, signed an open letter created by the non-profit organization Creative Community for Peace.
The Hollywood stars condemned the Hamas assault as ""barbaric acts of terrorism"" and called on Hamas, which is classified as a terrorist organization by the US, Germany, the EU and others, to release its Israeli hostages.
They also warned their entertainment industry colleagues against misinformation on social media, saying, ""As Israel takes the necessary steps to defend its citizens in the coming days and weeks, social media will be overrun by an orchestrated misinformation campaign spearheaded by Iran. We urge everyone to remember the horrific images that came out of Israel and to not amplify or fall for their propaganda.""
In several German cities, including Berlin, Munich and Rostock, many have demonstrated their solidarity with Israel at rallies in recent days.
But Germany's cultural institutions remained reticent. For example, it was not until October 11, four days after the attacks, that the German Cultural Council issued a statement that said it ""resolutely opposes any form of antisemitism"" and called on cultural institutions in Germany to clearly show their solidarity with Israel.

From this call it is perhaps possible to see what journalist and author Simon Strauss denounced in German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: ""Where are the Israeli flags? Where are the banners, the posters, the placards?""
Comparing the situation with the prompt declarations of solidarity with Ukraine following Russia's invasion, Strauss made it very clear in his article what he actually expects from Germany: More solidarity with Israel. After all, Israel's security and right to exist is Germany's reason of state, after Germany's systematic murder of six million Jews in the Holocaust. This reason of state is supported by the current government's coalition agreement, and has been reaffirmed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz in a government statement on October 12, 2023.
In his October 11 Spiegel Online column titled ""Why are you still silent?"", author Sascha Lobo elaborated the manifold reasons for the stubborn silence of many people who otherwise regularly speak out about grievances on social media.
He concludes by saying, ""Those who live in Germany today are not to blame for the Holocaust. But all those living here bear the responsibility to learn from it. And that can in no way mean remaining silent about antisemitic terrorism.""
The silence does not seem to be just a German problem. On the Artnet news site, which focuses on the international art trade, Jewish editor Katya Kazakina wrote of a ""deafening silence"" in the art world — especially from renowned and long-established galleries and museums, which in the past frequently spoke out when it came to defending human rights, as in the case of the Ukraine war, Black Lives Matter or LGBTQ rights.
""In New York, the home of the largest Jewish population outside of Israel, not a single major museum has so far expressed its official support for the Jewish state and, by extension, the Jewish people,"" Kazakina wrote on October 12.
""Not one major gallery chose to send a message of empathy and take a public stand against the slaughter of Jewish civilians."" She added, ""As a Jewish woman, who's been writing about art, artists, galleries, museums, auction houses, foundations, fairs, and lawsuits for more than 17 years, I feel a mixture of pain, disappointment, rage, and fear. (...) Where is the solidarity? Where is the empathy? Where is the moral compass?""
In their articles, Strauss, Lobo and Kazakina look for reasons why so little solidarity with Israel has been shown so far. Is it the fear of being seen as a ""colonialist"" in view of the suffering of the Palestinian civilian population in the Gaza Strip? Or is it ultimately antisemitic tendencies that have led to this ""deafening silence""?
Perhaps it is also the fear of Islamist terrorism. For example, the organizer of the solidarity demonstration for Israel in Munich has received death threats.
There may be many reasons for this silence, but the result remains the same: People of Jewish faith, already deeply shocked by the current events in Israel, are now further unsettled by this.

https://www.dw.com/en/100-years-of-disney-catapulting-cartoons-to-global-fame/a-65360595,FILM,100 years of Disney: Catapulting cartoons to global fame 16.10.2023,"""Just remember, it all started with a mouse,"" Walt Disney declared in a TV program in 1954.
At that time, his film production company had already been in business for more than 30 years and was one of the most successful in the US — with cartoons!
Mickey Mouse had not only become a screen hero, but was already smiling on T-shirts, footballs and toothbrush cups. One year later, in 1955, the cartoon mouse even came to life at the first Disneyland to open in California.
Walt Disney, who was born in 1901 and grew up on a farm in Missouri, started out as a commercial artist and then discovered animated films. With just $40 in his pocket, he set off for Hollywood and, on October 16, 1923, founded the Walt Disney Company, today a billion-dollar enterprise.
""It's kind of fun to do the impossible,"" was one of the cartoon pioneer's convictions.
Hidden behind this carefree statement was an intense, almost manic work ethic and workload, but also an unwavering belief in his own ideas. Time and again, the farm boy was on the verge of bankruptcy. His projects were considered too daring; with the latest film technology always being tested and and perfected. Driven, Walt Disney was soon sleeping on a couch in his studios, hardly seeing his own children, yet working hard in order to enchant other, unfamiliar children with his on-screen fairy tales.
Walt Disney made film history in 1937: ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" was the first full-length animated film to hit theaters — Mickey Mouse and Co. had previously only starred in short films. At the time, no one could have guessed that an additional 60 feature-length films would follow to this day.
After all, the daring producer Walt Disney had made a dramatic miscalculation: Instead of $250,000 (approx. €228,000), $1.5 million were required to complete the film; instead of 18 months, his cartoonists worked for three years on an idea that was considered complete lunacy in Hollywood. A feature-length animated film? Who's going to line up at the box office for that?
As became apparent after the film's release, it turned out that quite a few people would: ""Snow White"" grossed around $8 million — at a time when a movie ticket cost an average of 25 US cents.
Translated into 10 languages, the film went on to be a box office smash in 46 more countries.
Disney received an honorary Oscar at the following year's Academy Awards — or more precisely, and true to the film's title, eight: one normal-sized, plus seven miniature Oscar statuettes.
Working at Walt Disney Studios, on the other hand, was allegedly not always a fairy tale.
Requirements to work overtime, poor wages and a boss who micro-managed every stroke of the pen: those were the working conditions at the company, along with a boss whose creative ego demanded one name be shown in the opening credits — that of he himself, Walt Disney.
Even today, his signature adorns the logo of the billion-dollar corporation.
Yet it wasn't Walt Disney's talent alone that led to the success of the company.  He founded the studios together with his brother Roy, who later took over the finances.
The mouse that started it all was designed by art director Ub Iwerks, but apparently according to the strict specifications of the character's inventor.

Incidentally, Mickey Mouse was also created during an entrepreneurial low point: during a train journey back to Los Angeles. In New York, Walt Disney had been unable to reach an agreement with a distributor, who snatched his then successful short cartoons, ""Oswald the Lucky Rabbit,"" from right under his nose.
Walt Disney was both a visionary and a businessman. And he had a knack for discovering talented people.
Oddly, it was during the Great Depression at the end of the 1920s, when companies went bankrupt and many families became desperately poor, that merchandising was born.
With the ingenious advertising manager Kay Kamen on board, Mickey Mouse's likeness was emblazoned on socks, cereal boxes and footballs from the 1930s onward. Disney Studios soon earned considerably more from their advertising products than from the films themselves.
They are still a central source of income for the company, worth billions of dollars today.

Following ""Snow White,"" ""Pinocchio"" (1940), ""Dumbo"" (1941) and ""Bambi"" (1942) were among the films Disney Studios released. But the films were unable to match the success of ""Snow White"": The anticipated revenues failed to materialize, partly because the European sales market collapsed due to the Second World War.
Since hardly any banks could be found to provide the necessary loans for new productions, the company went public.
Today, according to the Institute for Media and Communications Policy, the Walt Disney Company ranks sixth among the world's most successful media groups and is part of the Dow Jones stock index, which lists the 30 most successful US companies.
During World War II, Disney Studios became an instrument of US propaganda. The studios produced numerous short films and cartoons that glorified US warfare and reproduced stereotypical images of the enemy.
For example, in the well-known propaganda film ""Der Fuehrer's Face"" (1943), Donald Duck is forced to work in an armaments factory in Nazi Germany and goes crazy hearing shouts of ""Heil Hitler.""
Likewise, Disney produced educational and training films for the US Army. Critics complained that the company would have been better off spreading pacifist and humanist messages instead of war propaganda.
In the post-World War II years, Disney built on the success of his feature-length films — with ""Alice in Wonderland"" (1951) and ""Peter Pan"" (1953).
In 1955, Walt Disney had another crazy idea: his fairy tale worlds were to become reality, and so the first Disneyland was built in the US state of California. Later, offshoots followed in Florida, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Walt Disney was awarded 26 Oscars during his lifetime — an unprecedented record. However, he did not live to see the premiere of his last film, ""The Jungle Book"" (1967), as he died of lung cancer in 1966.
Still, the Disney brand lived on, despite a massive financial crisis during the early 1980s. In 1986, Walt's nephew Roy E. Disney took over management of the animation studio and, together with Jeffrey Katzenberg, led a ""Disney renaissance"": ""The Little Mermaid"" (1989), ""Beauty and the Beast"" (1991) and ""The Lion King"" (1994) were born.
""I think when you relate Disney to anything, you relate it to magic, and imagination and creativity, and I think that's what's so different about our company: It's that we tell stories and we make magic in everything that we do,"" Betty Cline, director of the Walt Disney Archive, told DW.
From the 2000s onward, the former cartoon company set its sights on expansion. First, it bought the successful animation studio Pixar (with whom it had already produced films such as ""Toy Story"" and ""Finding Nemo""), then swallowed the numerous superhero films with Marvel, and finally, the long-running box office hit company Lucasfilm with the ""Star Wars"" series. TV series and several prequels, sequels and spin-offs followed.
Of course, in the spirit of its founder, Disney continues to keep pace with technological innovations. Although its own streaming platform Disney+ started somewhat late in 2019 and stumbled at first, its quarterly figures for 2022 now position it in third place worldwide behind Netflix and Amazon Prime.
While the billion-dollar corporation may be able to safely overcome financial hurdles, its former core business — fairy-tale films — has come under fire. Following allegations of racist depictions in classics such as ""Dumbo"" or ""The Jungle Book,"" Disney began adding warning labels to its films.
In response to criticism of cultural appropriation, such as in the marketing of the Swahili saying ""Hakuna Matata"" (loosely: ""No worries"") from the 1994 film ""The Lion King,"" the corporation is also now trying to deal more sensitively with the cultural attributes of other nations and peoples. So on the occasion of the 100th anniversary, it launched the long-awaited live-action film version of ""The Little Mermaid"" — with leading Black actress Halle Bailey.
The ""Disney 100"" international exhibition tour is currently on show in London, and opens in Chicago on November 18.

https://www.dw.com/en/frankfurt-book-fair-postpones-award-for-palestinian-author-adania-shibli/a-67093842,LITERATURE,Frankfurt Book Fair postpones award for Palestinian author Adania Shibli 13.10.2023,"Palestinian author Adania Shibli was meant to accept the ""LiBeraturpreis"" of the LitProm association on October 20 at the Frankfurt Book Fair, which honors women writers from the Global South for a work newly published in German.
Shibli's novel ""Minor Detail"" received high praise from some critics.
Its English translation, by Elisabeth Jaquette, was published in 2020 and was shortlisted for the 2020 National Book Award for Translated Literature, and longlisted for the International Booker Prize the following year.
But others criticized it harshly for what they saw as serving antisemitic narratives.
The Zurich newspaper Tagesanzeiger asked, ""In these times, can a novel that depicts Israel as a killing machine be honored with awards?"" The paper gets to the heart of the debate unfolding in the run-up to the world's largest trade fair for books: How should literature be dealt with that ""allegedly brings anti-Israel and antisemitic sentiment into the cultural scene""?
After scenes of pro-Hamas jubilant celebrations on Berlin's streets over the weekend, the German daily newspaper taz was also critical: ""Instead of baklava for passers-by who rejoice at the deaths of Israeli civilians,"" the paper writes, ""prizes are also awarded to works that portray the state of Israel as a murder machine, to the applause of perhaps well-meaning donors.""
In its statement announcing the award, the LitProm association said that Shibli's novel was a ""rigorously composed work of art that tells of the power of borders and of what violent conflicts make of people.""
That was long before the militant Islamist group Hamas, which is classified as a terrorist organization by the EU, the US, Germany and others, attacked Israel over the past weekend, massacring the civilian population. But even back when the decision on the award's winner was made back in summer 2023, it caused controversy: Journalist Ulrich Noller of German public broadcaster WDR left the jury in protest at the time.
Born in 1974, Adania Shibli lives and works in both Berlin and Jerusalem. The Palestinian author is currently the Writer-in-Residence at the Literaturhaus Zurich, and in 2021, she held the Friedrich Dürrenmatt Guest Professorship for World Literature at the University of Bern, Switzerland.
Her novel ""Minor Detail"" is made up of two parts.
The first tells of a Palestinian girl who is raped and murdered in the Negev Desert during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. 
Israeli soldiers stationed in the desert are bored. The commander has hallucinations. On patrol, he encounters a group of bedouins, whom he orders shot, all except for the girl and a dog, both of which are taken to the military camp.
The second part of the novel takes places decades later.
A journalist from Ramallah tries to understand that crime.
The taz critic felt that the book's first-person narrative and empathetic tone masks a basic problem of the text: All Israeli soldiers are portrayed as anonymous rapists and killers, while the Palestinians are victims of trigger-happy occupiers. Violence against Israeli civilians is not mentioned, perhaps because it is considered a legitimate means in the struggle for liberation against the occupiers.
This, according to the taz, is the ""ideological and inhuman basis"" of the book.
The conclusion of the novel also seems like ""a pamphleteering indictment"" in which all the stereotypes of the text are once again bundled, adds the critic.
In the meantime, the LitProm association has responded to the latest developments: ""Due to the war in Israel,"" it was decided to cancel the planned award ceremony at the Frankfurt Book Fair, the association wrote on its website.
The statement initially noted that the decision had been taken ""along with the author,"" since ""no one feels like celebrating at the moment,"" but Shibli's US publisher, New Directions, said that the author was rather presented with the decision and that she would have used the ceremony to reflect on the role of literature in the current context.
LitProm, an association for the promotion of literature from Africa, Asia and Latin America, added that it still wants to award its prize to Adania Shibli's novel ""Minor Detail,"" despite the criticism.
The authors' association PEN Berlin had earlier commented on the criticism of the book. ""No book becomes different, better, worse or more dangerous because the news situation changes,"" said PEN Berlin spokeswoman Eva Menasse.
""Either a book is worthy of an award, or it is not. The jury's decision for Shibli, which was made weeks ago, was in my opinion a very good one. To withdraw the prize from her would be fundamentally wrong, from a political as well as a literary standpoint,"" Menasse added.
Meanwhile, Frankfurt Book Fair director Juergen Boos commented on the attacks: ""We condemn the barbaric terror of Hamas against Israel in the strongest possible terms,"" said Boos.
He added that the terrorism against Israel contradicts all the values of the Frankfurt Book Fair, which stands in ""full solidarity at Israel's side,"" he said. Therefore, he added, the fair wants to ""make Jewish and Israeli voices particularly visible.""
To that end, author and peace activist Lizzie Doron, who lives in Tel Aviv and Berlin, will speak about current events in Israel at the literature gala on October 21.
There will also be ""additional moments onstage for Israeli voices,"" Boos announced, such as the event ""Out of Concern for Israel.""
Due to travel restrictions, however, some events had to be canceled, such as two concerts by Israeli singers.
This year marks the 75th edition of the Frankfurt Book Fair. One highlight is likely to be the appearance of author Salman Rushdie. The Indian-British author will receive the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. Strict security precautions are being taken for Rushdie's visit.
As recently as August 2022, the writer, who was threatened by Islamists, was attacked with a knife while onstage in the United States, leaving Rushdie blind in his right eye.
Other big topics at the book fair include artificial intelligence, the climate emergency and the fight against populism and extremism.
On many book fair podiums — in addition to discussing the rise of Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and the ongoing war in Ukraine — the Middle East conflict is likely to be the main topic of discussion.
Originally, only a discussion on the topic of the ""Crisis of Democracy in Israel"" was planned in the trade fair event calendar.

Correction, October 17, 2023: A previous version of this article, published on October 13, 2023, quoted a statement from Litprom which said that Shibli had agreed to canceling the LiBeraturpreis award ceremony.

https://www.dw.com/en/disputed-qatar-a-good-fit-for-israel-gaza-peace-talks/a-67091112,POLITICS,Disputed Qatar a good fit for Israel-Gaza peace talks? 13.10.2023,"In light of the escalation of the current war between Israel and the Hamas terror group, mediation efforts have started to focus on cease-fire negotiations and a potential prisoner swap. 
Hamas, which rules over the Gaza Strip, is considered a terrorist organization by the US, EU and others.  
The first round of talks reportedly aims to see if a swap of Israelis and foreigners kidnapped by Hamas fighters last Saturday for Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons could be a realistic next step. 
So far, Egypt, which signed a peace agreement with Israel in 1979 and shares a border with Israel and Gaza, has offered a hand at the negotiating table.
Turkey, which maintains ties with Israel as well as the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood — of which Gaza's Hamas is the Palestinian wing — has also signaled its willingness to arbitrate.
Qatar, which has already mediated between the belligerents several times in the past — such as during the 2014  Israel-Gaza War — is back at the negotiating table, too.
But Qatar froze relations with Israel in 2009 and is widely known as a major financier of Hamas — which the EU, US, Germany and many other countries have labeled a terrorist organization.
Last Saturday, Qatar also said Israel bore responsibility for the Hamas attack that killed some 1,300 Israelis, internationals and soldiers.
Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at the UK-based think tank Chatham House, nevertheless sees Qatar as a viable mediator between Israel and Hamas.
Middle Eastern countries should lead the way in de-escalating the current war, she argues in a piece on the think tank's website. 
""Qatar has long had a pragmatic relationship where it has used financial incentives to manage and de-escalate various rounds of tensions and war between Israel and Hamas,"" Vakil told DW, adding that she sees Qatar as ""a natural go-between to secure the hostages and find entry points to de-escalate and protect people on the ground as the humanitarian issue worsens.""
Guido Steinberg, senior associate at the Berlin-based think tank German Institute for International and Security Affairs and author of several books on terrorism in the Middle East, sees Qatar's mediating role in the current conflict as feasible given the emirate's good relations with opposing political actors. 
For example, Qatar maintains a large US airbase while at the same time fostering good relations with Iran — an archenemy of America and Israel and a major Hamas backer.
Recently, Qatar took possession of $6 billion (€5.7 billion) in Iranian funds as part of a deal to free Americans detained in Iran.
On Thursday, US cable network CNN  that the US and Qatar had ""reached a 'quiet understanding' not to allow Iran to access any money following Hamas' bloody attack on Israel on Saturday."" 
Qatar has also served as Hamas' political headquarters for more than a decade. And Ismail Haniyeh, its current head, has lived in Turkey and Doha since 2020.
Last Saturday, Haniyeh shared his proud take on Hamas' attack of Israel in an uninterrupted 30-minute broadcast on the Qatar-based TV network Al Jazeera — which is largely funded by the Qatari government — ""without any commentary from their [Al Jazeera's] editors,"" Steinberg told DW.
""It is obvious to assume that Haniyeh was aware of the attack in advance, which means that at least some of the information about the impending attack was present in Doha,"" Steinberg said.
However, he says he wouldn't assume the Qatari government was informed about the attack in advance. 
Cinzia Bianco, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, also doubts the Qatari government was informed, albeit for a different reason.
""As part of Qatar's rapprochement with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt in 2021 [which ended Qatar's four-year isolation in the region], Qatar agreed to weaken their relations to Hamas to the bare minimum,"" she told DW.
""That included cutting the financial flows to the Gaza Strip,"" she adds. Bianco concludes they ""don't have the leverage they used to have,"" which could in turn impact their influence at the negotiating table. 
She also regards the relevance of Qatar's Al Jazeera as more limited compared to the past. ""It still is a powerful instrument but not as powerful as it used to be before social media,"" she told DW.
Fitting perhaps that Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani's sister has taken to social media. 
While international landmarks, such as the White House in Washington, Berlin's Brandenburger Gate or the Sydney Opera House, were lit in solidarity with the colors of the Israeli flag, it was the Palestinian flag that was projected on the National Museum of Qatar and the Museum of Islamic Art in Qatar's capital Doha.
Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani shared photos of the light installations with her 1 million Instagram followers, writing in Arabic, ""Oh Allah, we entrust Palestine and its people to you.""

https://www.dw.com/en/jon-fosse-wins-nobel-prize-in-literature/a-67004466,LITERATURE,Jon Fosse wins Nobel Prize in Literature 05.10.2023,"The Swedish Academy on Thursday awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Literature to Norwegian author Jon Fosse.
The academy hailed his ""innovative plays and prose which give voice to the unsayable."" 
""I am overwhelmed and grateful. I see this as an award to the literature that first and foremost aims to be literature, without other considerations,"" the author said in a statement released by his publishing house right after the Nobel Prize committee announced his name. 
Born in 1959 in the Norwegian coastal town of Haugesund, Jon Fosse is considered one of the most important contemporary European writers.
He has been described as ""the Beckett of the 21st century"" by French daily Le Monde and as ""one of the most provocative pens in contemporary theater,"" by Canada's Globe & Mail.
Fosse published his first novel, ""Red, Black,"" in 1983. He has since published numerous novels, stories, books of poetry, essay collections and even children's books.

After his first play, whose English title is ""And We'll Never Be Parted,"" was published in 1994, the prolific author went on to write some 40 theatrical pieces.
His international breakthrough as a playwright came with the 1999 staging of ""Someone Is Going to Come"" by late French theater director Claude Regy.
The play centers on a man and a woman who move to a run-down house in the middle of nowhere to be alone, but quickly become paranoid that ""someone is going to come,"" sparking hidden jealousies within the couple.  




















According to the Booker Prize website, his plays have since been staged more than a thousand times around the world in 50 languages.
Fellow Norwegian author Karl Ove Knausgaard, who used to be his student, details how influential Fosse's work was for him in ""My Struggle.""
Fosse was made Chevalier of the Ordre national du Merite of France in 2003.
Fosse's magnum opus is his ""Septology,"" published in three volumes from 2019-2021 under the titles ""The Other Name,"" ""I Is Another"" and ""A New Name.""  
Through a single-sentence monologue of an elderly artist talking to himself, the 1,250-page prose work offers a bleak but ecstatic reflection on art and God.
Fosse has told New Yorker magazine that the aging artist's reckoning with religion is ""not autobiographical at all,"" but the Norwegian author had his own religious awakening a decade ago. Until 2012, he described himself as an atheist, but he then joined the Catholic Church and during the same period, underwent treatment to overcome his long-term alcoholism.
The critically-acclaimed work was shortlisted for several prizes, including the National Book Award and the International Booker Prize. 
Fosse divides his time between his homes in Austria, in Oslo and in the western part of Norway.
Aside from completing his own writing projects, Fosse has also translated other authors' works, including Kafka's ""The Trial,"" which he describes as one of his favorite novels.
The Nobel Prize is worth 11 million Swedish crowns ($990,000, €948,000).
The Swedish Academy, the body responsible for selecting the laureates in literature, is made up of authors, historians, philosophers and linguists. The academy has long been criticized for the overrepresentation of Western white male authors among its laureates and was rocked by a #MeToo scandal in 2018.
Last year's winner was French author Annie Ernaux, who the Swedish Academy praised for ""courage and critical acuity.""
In 2021, the academy honored British Tanzanian-born writer Abdulrazak Gurnah, whose work explores exile, colonialism and racism.

https://www.dw.com/en/will-egypts-presidential-election-bring-any-real-change/a-66995599,POLITICS,Will Egypt's presidential election bring any real change? 04.10.2023,"It didn't take long for Egypt to jump into election mode. Just days after the announcement that a presidential election would take place from December 10 to 12,  and not in 2024 as initially planned, billboards and posters featuring Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi started to replace sale advertisements along popular streets.
Observers do not doubt that the 68-year-old will remain in power, even though seven other candidates have announced their intention to run, and the deadline for further candidates to enter the race is not until October 14.
""Other candidates have no chance of winning the election, because there's no opportunity for them to compete,"" Timothy E. Kaldas, deputy director of the Washington-based Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, told DW.
Indeed, the two most promising opposition candidates, Ahmed Altantawy, the former head of the leftist al-Karama (Dignity) Party, and Gameela Ismail, the chairwoman of the liberal al-Dostour (Constitution) Party, reported that their supporters were being harassed, interrogated and, in Altantawy's case, also detained.
The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), a Cairo-based think tank, confirmed that the crackdown on Altantawy's supporters ""has intensified, with at least 73 campaign members detained in connection to charges of joining a subversive or terrorist group, spreading false news, and misusing social media.""
""They were interrogated simply for filling out volunteer forms in Altantawy's presidential campaign, while others just liked the campaign's Facebook page,"" the think tank added.
Egypt's National Election Authority, which oversees the country's electoral process, responded in a statement that these claims ""are baseless and false allegations.""
Meanwhile, Mada Masr, Egypt's last non-state-controlled news site, reported that the phone of Altantawy was hacked multiple times in the past months.
""There is very little reason to believe that this election will look any different to that of 2018,"" Alice Gower, Director of Geopolitics and Security at the London-based consultancy firm Azure Strategy, told DW.
In the 2018 election, el-Sissi won with 97% against one allied opponent after four opposition candidates were arrested or decided to quit due to threats and intimidation. 
El-Sissi has been in power since 2013 after leading a military coup that toppled Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, democratically elected after the Arab Spring uprising in 2011. Two elections have occurred since, in 2014 and 2018, but observers criticize that both lacked fairness.
In 2019, el-Sissi consolidated his power after amending the constitution, allowing the incumbent to stand for a third term. The changes also adjusted the length of presidential terms from four to six years, which would see el-Sissi in power until 2030 should he win.
Despite el-Sissi calling on ""Egyptians to witness this democratic scene, and to choose the right person for the role,"" at a congress last weekend, Kaldas regards the upcoming vote as ""electoral theater.""
""If there was a competitive election, el-Sissi would be extremely vulnerable,"" he said. ""Public discontent with the leadership, the deterioration in the economy, and the standard of living of most Egyptians has deteriorated for the duration of el-Sissi's tenure.""
Egypt has been mired in an economic crisis for years, and Russia's war in Ukraine has exacerbated the financial situation of the wheat-importing country — food prices have soared nearly 72% over the past year.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Egypt's GDP growth is predicted to be just 3.7% in 2023, after 6.7% growth in 2022. The country is also grappling with record inflation of 39%, and a loss of 50% of the Egyptian pound's value against the US dollar since February 2022, according to Egypt's Central Agency for Mobilization and Statistics. 
Egypt signed a $3 billion (€2.85 billion) agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in December 2022. However, it has only received $347 million of the loan because the nation has yet to make the required budgetary cuts and reforms. Meanwhile, the country's foreign currency reserves are almost depleted. In light of these figures, a few comments in el-Sissi's campaign speech last weekend caused irritation.
""If the price of the nation's progress and prosperity is hunger and thirst, let us not eat or drink,"" he said.
In response, Altantawy posted on X, formerly Twitter, that ""Egyptians actually starved during your rule because of your administration.""
Egypt's international partners have also started voicing more criticism and demands. For example, Gulf countries, who have long unconditionally supported Egypt financially, ""have made quite clear, both publicly and privately, that they're dissatisfied with the way the country is being run,"" Kaldas told DW.
Egypt, however, is not only scrutinized economically but also over its poor human rights record. Human rights organizations have long estimated that 65,000 to 70,000 political prisoners are held in pretrial detention or after unjust trials in Egypt's prisons. In the run-up to the presidential election, this crackdown has intensified once more.
Earlier this week, the human rights organization Redress, and several Egyptian non-governmental organizations concluded in a legal analysis that the use of torture by Egyptian authorities was so widespread and systematic that it amounted to a crime against humanity under customary international law. The NGOs submitted the report to the United Nations Committee Against Torture ahead of its review of Egypt's record in November. 
""Political opponents are silenced by jailing them, civil society organizations are limited by making obligatory licensing very difficult, and organizing [protest] has become very difficult, as the political space has pretty much eroded in the last 10 years,"" Lina Attalah, editor-in-chief of Mada Masr, told DW.
That's what makes the protests across the country earlier this week all the more remarkable. Several state-sponsored rallies celebrating el-Sissi's candidacy announcement turned into anti-government demonstrations, but were quickly dismissed as art gatherings by the authorities, according to the German news agency dpa.
Numerous videos on social media, verified as accurate by Egyptian activists, showed people shouting: ""The people call for the fall of the regime.""

https://www.dw.com/en/assassins-creed-mirage-why-time-traveling-never-gets-old/a-66982134,CULTURE,'Assassin's Creed Mirage': Why time traveling never gets old 04.10.2023,"The ""Assassin's Creed"" game series has been sending gamers back in time since 2007.
In the first title of the series, players traveled back to the 12th century and explored Jerusalem. In other games, they sailed through the Caribbean on impressive ships; experienced the social upheaval in Paris caused by the French Revolution; explored pyramids in ancient Egypt; fought against the Athenians and Spartans in Ancient Greece; and finally slipped into the role of a Viking — with the option of selecting a female Viking — to conquer England.
Even though the locations and epochs depicted in the game series are exotic, they were generally chosen for their popularity among the fan base.
The setting of the new game, ""Assassin's Creed Mirage,"" is perhaps not as present in current pop culture: The action takes place in Baghdad in the 9th century.
Today's capital of Iraq, which its residents then also called Madinat-al-Salam, the City of Peace, was a thriving metropolis under the rule of the Abbasid Caliphate. It was the center of powerful secular and religious rulers, contemporary artists, traders, philosophers and scientists.
At the time, at least 500,000 people of various religious faiths lived in the city by the Tigris River.
When recreating historical settings for the games, the ""Assassin's Creed"" developers have always aimed to achieve a high level of authenticity.
Players are led to discover particular historical locations in the game world, and also get to learn about how people lived during that period and meet important historical figures.
In ""Assassin's Creed Mirage,"" for example, they meet scholar Ali ibn Muhammad, an opponent of the ruling Abbasids, or the Banu Musa brothers, three gifted scientists and inventors.
The games are not 100% historically accurate — but they don't have to be, says historian Lucas Haasis, who researches games and history and introduces such video games as educational tools in universities and schools.
What is crucial, he points out, is that the games are credible. They give players an ""impression of an era that couldn't be obtained in any other way. No other medium can do that,"" Haasis tells DW. ""You can immerse yourself in the atmosphere of an era, and that leads you to become curious about it; you might not have developed that interest otherwise.""
He reports that many students have chosen to study history because they wanted to learn more about the past after playing ""Assassin's Creed.""
Games also offer the opportunity to integrate historians' latest findings and contribute to remembrance cultureby sharing history in a more colorful way.
Historians have been involved in the development of ""Assassin's Creed Mirage"" since 2021. The team includes renowned experts such as Glaire Anderson from the University of Edinburgh, who researches Islamic art and architecture in the age of the Caliphs (650-1250), and Vanessa van Renterghem, who is specialized in the social and urban history of Baghdad's early era.
The studio also worked closely with museums.
""I think it's very important that more and more historians open up about games,"" says Lucas Haasis. ""Because games are here to stay and are becoming more and more important.""
For many young people, games are simply part of their lives. Haasis therefore sees a great opportunity in games that are based on history. ""We should encourage young people to be interested in history. At the same time,"" he adds, ""we should train their critical perspective,"" in order to allow them to recognize the differences between fact and fiction. They should all be aware that ""what is being presented is an illusion, a reconstruction by the developers,"" explains the historian.
Almost nothing remains of the original city, which was founded on July 30, 762, and grew up out of the desert sand within a few decades. What is known is that it had a circular layout, with the caliph's palace standing in the center.
The sparse documentation related to the city during that era allowed developers to be more creative in the depiction of the location. They used as sources of inspiration a book about Baghdad during the Abbasid Caliphate by English scholar Guy Le Strange (1854-1933), as well as contemporary travel reports and archaeological finds.
Players are now free to explore this magnificent city, riding a horse or a camel, or walking through its busy streets, and marveling at its mosques with turquoise domes shining in the sun.
Items are collected throughout the game, including in recreated historical locations, and they offer more information about the history of Baghdad.
The sometimes confusing story in the ""Assassin's Creed"" games always revolves around the conflict between Templars and Assassins or their predecessor organizations, the Order of the Elders and the Hidden Ones. This is also part of the narrative in ""Assassin's Creed Mirage.""
The games have always featured solid gameplay, without, however, revolutionizing the genre. It can therefore be assumed that the historical settings are the main draw in the ""Assassin's Creed"" series, which counts 155 million fans worldwide, according to the games' developing company, Ubisoft.
""I think there is a basic interest in us as humans to think about where we come from. At the same time what appeals to us about history is the strangeness of the past era; there's an almost constant interplay between this familiarity and strangeness,"" says historian Lucas Haasis. ""Time travel in a video game combines both levels at the same time. And these virtual journeys naturally take place in a protected space; you have nothing to fear. That's what makes diving into the past in games so appealing.""
Anyone who — like the author of these lines — has played every title in the series will feel immediately taken by ""Assassin's Creed Mirage,"" which is released for all gaming platforms on October 5, 2023.
Basim, a supporting character in ""Assassin's Creed Valhalla"" (2020), takes on the main role in the new game. Many tasks and game mechanics from the beginning of the series have been implemented, such as following or eavesdropping on characters, observing guards' paths, or the useful eagle eye that highlights enemies and treasure chests. If danger is imminent, it is advisable to go into hiding or tear wanted posters from the walls.
Since he is not a tough guy, Basim has to act from the shadows — or more specifically, from a haystack or the bushes — in order to sneak into palaces or enemy areas. If he is discovered, escape is his best option.
He practices parkour to make his way over the roofs of the city, using the countless wall ledges, wooden beams, pulleys, stacked boxes and taut ropes to quickly get away. The city's dense development is ideal for urban parkour expeditions.
The story typically revolves around the eternal conflict between powerful secret societies and the quest for the shards of Eden, powerful artifacts that can rob people of their free will. But the storyline is admittedly secondary to the excitement of immersing yourself in another era and drifting through a bustling and opulent city — from the comfort of your own home.

https://www.dw.com/en/eu-enlargement-is-the-bloc-ready-for-new-members/a-66975546,POLITICS,EU enlargement: Is the bloc ready for new members? 02.10.2023,"Since February 2022, a new consensus has settled in Brussels: The European Union needs to grow larger. EU members once considered enlargement skeptics now agree that it's time to start thinking seriously about welcoming hopefuls like Ukraine, Moldova and Western Balkan states into the club.
The shift was prompted by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Before then, loose plans for expanding were Brussels' favorite proverbial can to kick down the road, passed from one administration to the next while aspirant members such as North Macedonia — an EU candidate since 2005 — jumped through a series of shapeshifting political and judicial hoops to qualify for access without ever exiting the waiting room.
These days, the mindset has changed. As one EU diplomat put it: ""Enlargement is a reality now, and it wasn't a year and a half ago.""
But Brussels has its own homework to do if the political consensus is to become a practical path. ""Before you can have a realistic conversation with the countries coming in, we have to figure out what an enlarged EU would actually look like — and that's as far as we've gotten,"" the diplomat, who asked not to be named, told DW. ""We know the questions but we don't really know the answers to them.""
The conversation has, however, begun. Earlier this month, a group of researchers commissioned by France and Germany unveiled a paper full of ideas on the workings of and pathway toward a larger union. Thu Nguyen, a senior policy fellow at the Jacques Delors Centre in Berlin, was among them. She told DW that rethinking how the EU takes decisions could prove most politically challenging.
The official list of EU candidate countries is long: Ukraine, Moldova,Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey. Georgia and Kosovo are also considered ""potential candidates.""
But even with 27 members, the bloc sometimes struggles to take action. Foreign policy moves like sanctioning Russia require unanimous backing, meaning negotiations can sometimes take months as member states hash out which products to ban or whose assets to freeze.
Changes to other policy areas like migration and asylum require support from a ""qualified majority"" of EU members — meaning at least 15 states which also represent at least 65% of the bloc's population. Last week, the limits of this political arithmatic were also on display when Germany greenlit reforms to a new rulebook for migration crises, only for fellow heavyweight Italy to swiftly walk out and leave the deal deadlocked.
Under the current system, Ukraine — with its population of more than 40 million — would become one of the most politically powerful countries in the EU. Meanwhile, each smaller Western Balkan state such as Montenegro — population circa 620,000 — or Albania with its roughly 2.7 million inhabitants — would add more voices into the mix.
""The more the member states there are, the more risk of having veto players that block decisions,"" Nguyen said. That could prove even tougher for politically-loaded calls like blocking EU funds to countries accused of breaching rule of law standards.
Nguyen and her co-authors therefore suggest scrapping unanimity and recalculating qualified majority voting shares to make sure a bigger EU still has the ""capacity to act."" Controversially, that proposal would also make it more difficult for big powers France and Germany to block agreement.
But such reforms would require a rewrite of the bloc's founding laws and need support from member states who would lose power in the reshuffle. And, as Nguyen acknowledges, ""the political mood currently is not very favorable toward treaty change.""

Then there's the question of how to divvy up EU funds across deeper economic disparities. Most EU candidates have a lower GDP per capita than the bloc's current poorest member Bulgaria — and with around a third of Brussels' current budget assigned to agriculture subsidies, the arrival of farming powerhouse Ukraine would radically shift the current disribution sheet.
Last month, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary announced plans for unilateral embargoes on Ukrainian grain to protect their own producers from potential price drops. For the EU's former trade commissioner Phil Hogan, this shows the rocky road ahead.
""There's going to have to be huge institutional change, huge budget change and policy adaptation to the new reality,"" Hogan told DW. ""Ukraine is a huge country with huge agricultural interests. And the notion that you would overnight be able to deal with the issues of Ukraine becoming a fully integrated member of the European Union's agricultural policy is going to be a major challenge.""
""Even in my time, there were sensitivities around many trade issues with Ukraine,"" he added. ""It's nothing new to have tensions between Ukraine and Europe in relation to agriculture — but you can imagine the challenges are going to be ahead for the European farmers in the context of the Western Balkans and Ukraine and others becoming part and parcel of the family.""
Still, Hogan remains hopeful: ""I am very much in favor of the expansion of the European Union and bringing into our European fold countries that otherwise could go into a different fold that we may not like,"" he said, making a thinly-veiled allusion to Russian influence.
""Politics is about the art of the possible and I expect that the existing member states will stretch themselves and their citizens will stretch themselves to ensure that we have our neighbourhood in a less tense place.""
There are all sorts of smaller questions about the functioning of a larger EU which also need answers: How many more lawmakers would enter the European Parliament? How many more official EU languages would there be? Could each country maintain a dedicated member of the European Commission?
Given the legal and political quagmire that likely lies ahead, some think it's time to broaden the definition of the bloc. This week, as Europe's leaders head to Spain for a third meeting of the European Political Community (EPC), one vision of a wider intergovernmental set-up is on display.
The EPC is the brainchild of French President Emmanuel Macron. When he first publicly floated the idea in 2022, Macron said it could take ""decades"" for Ukraine to join the EU, and argued for a new grouping that ""would allow democratic European nations"" to ""find a new space for political and security cooperation.""
Today, the EPC is fomally nothing more than a talking shop, with no established structures, voting rights or treaties attached. But it is the only forum of its kind uniting its broad church of 45 invitees. It includes all EU countries and candidates, wealthy nations staying an arm's length from the bloc like Switzerland, Norway, and the United Kingdom, and even political rivals Armenia and Azerbaijan. Russia is not on the guestlist.
For Thu Nguyen and her fellow researchers, this looser structure could provide a clue about what might happen if the EU fails to agree on an expansion plan.
They suggest there could be a core ""inner circle"" of closely integrated EU countries, then the wider EU, then a next level of ""associate members"" who enjoy some benefits linked to the bloc's single market, and an ""outer circle"" based on the EPC, which Nguyen says would ""not include any form of integration with binding EU law… but rather a cooperation based on geostrategic considerations.""
But this potential multi-speed approach may prove unpopular, seen by some as creating second-class citizens in the EU's club. Ukraine's Prime Minister Dennis Shmyhal recently told news outlet Politico his country is ""performing all the maximum efforts to ensure that Ukraine would become a fully-fledged member of the European Union.""
The European Commission often insists accession is a merit-based process with no timeline. Still, European Council President Charles Michel recently said the bloc itself should be ready for enlargement by 2030.
Thu Nguyen also backs an end-of-decade target — but, asked whether that's realistic, she says simply: ""It's difficult to make a prognosis.""
""This is a very long term process,"" Nguyen said. ""We're very much at the beginning of the discussion and of the debate.""

https://www.dw.com/en/asian-games-five-talking-points-so-far/a-66968887,SPORTS,Asian Games: Five talking points so far 30.09.2023,"US Open quarterfinalist Zheng Qinwen won gold for China in the women's singles tennis, beating compatriot Zhu Lin 6-2, 6-4 in the final and adding to her maiden WTA title which she won in Palermo, Italy, in July.
""Palermo was my personal achievement,"" said the 20-year-old world number 23, fondly known as ""Queen Wen"" by her growing army of fans. ""That title [was important] because I did poorly in the previous two Grand Slams and I needed to play some lower-level tournaments to earn more points.
""But this feels different because here I'm representing my country. For the Asian Games we worked hard and did a lot of preparation because we regard this competition as very important.""
Having already racked up 205 medals at the halfway stage in Hangzhou, 107 of them gold, hosts China are making the most of home advantage.
In addition to traditional Asian martial arts such as kung fu (11 golds) and taekwondo (3), the Chinese have also won gold in classic Olympic sports including swimming (28), shooting (12), rowing (11) and gymnastics (8).
At some distance, Japan (28 golds) and South Korea (27) are neck-and-neck in the battle for second place in the medals table, with Uzbekistan, India and Thailand leading the best of the rest.
One discipline in which the hosts haven't had it all their own way, however, is shooting, where India broke the world record in the men's 50m rifle shooting en route to beating China to gold.
Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar, Swapnil Suresh Kusale and Akhil Sheoran secured first place with a total of 1,769 points, six points more than China and eight more than the previous record set by the United States last November.
Their achievement, one of six golds for India so far in shooting in Hangzhou, even earned praise from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
""A stupendous win, prestigious gold and a world record,"" he posted to his 92 million followers on the X platform, formerly known as Twitter. ""They have shown exceptional determination and teamwork.""
It was India's 32nd medal overall.
After featuring as a demonstration sport at the last Asian Games in Jakarta, Indonesia, eSports is making its competitive debut in Hangzhou – and proving wildly popular as the only event for which organizers have had to introduce a lottery system for tickets.
Competition forms vary by genre but gold medals are awarded for each game, with China taking gold in ""Arena of Valor,"" Thailand winning in ""EA Sports FC"" (the football simulation formerly known as ""FIFA"") and South Korea coming out on top in ""Street Fighter V.""
On Friday evening, South Korean star Lee ""Faker"" Sang-hyeok and his teammates beat Taiwan 2-0 in the League of Legends final, winning not only gold but also exemption from military service.
With their country still technically at war with North Korea, all able-bodied South Korean men must serve at least 18 months in the military, but the e-sports pros will now be able to complete their mandatory service in a civilian fashion, doing just three weeks of basic military training before completing 544 hours of community service.
Exemptions from military service are controversial in South Korea, and the idea of gamers earning one has reignited a heated debate.
Seventeen female Afghan athletes are competing in Hangzhou, all of whom are based outside the country due to the Taliban's effective ban on women's sport – including co-flagbearer Kimia Yousofi, who started in the women's 100m heats on Friday.
However, the Australian-based sprinter finished last, 0.03 seconds slower than her personal best of 13.29 and failing to qualify.
""The most important thing for me is to represent our girls in Afghanistan,"" she said, calling on her female compatriots to ""work on themselves, that means read books, everything they need for themselves personally.""
Boxer Khaibar Nooristani provided a more positive result, but not the sort that Afghanistan will have wanted as he tested positive for two banned anabolic steroids and was provisionally suspended by the International Testing Agency (ITA).
""The sample was collected by the ITA at the Asian Games in Hangzhou during an out-of-competition anti-doping control performed on September 21, 2023,"" the body said Thursday, the test coming four days before Nooristani's defeat in the preliminary rounds of the 71kg weight class.
""The athlete has been informed of the case and has been provisionally suspended with immediate effect. He has the right to request the analysis of the B-sample.""
Speaking earlier this week, Mani Jegathesan, an adviser to the Olympic Council of Asia's anti-doping committee, warned that drug cheats at the Games would be rooted out.
""Every participating athlete must understand that they could be picked at any time,"" Jegathesan warned. ""This is the best step to ensuring we have a clean event.""
With about 12,000 athletes at the 19th Asian Games, more competitors than at the Olympics, Jegathesan admitted it is impossible to test them all, but said world or Asian record breakers would be ""prioritized."" They will also home in on athletes if they receive ""intelligence.""

Following the daily news, navigating diplomacy and politics or observing trials in international courts: Translation's significance in almost all aspects of life can't be underscored enough.










In 2017, the United Nations officially declared September 30 as International Translation Day. The date was chosen as it is also the feast day of St. Jerome, a Catholic priest who translated the Bible and is considered the patron saint of translators.
Hailing from north-eastern Italy, he spoke an Illyrian dialect but is best known for translating the Greek manuscripts of the Bible's New Testament into Latin and for translating parts of the Hebrew Gospel into Greek. Jerome had learned Latin in school and was fluent in Greek and Hebrew, which he picked up from his studies and travels. He died near Bethlehem on September 30, 420.
More recently, in 2020, the European Commission (EC) launched the campaign ""Discover Translation,"" encouraging people to consider translation work as a career option.
""Without translation, the world would be a duller, poorer and more unequal place, both economically and culturally, where only the 'happy few' with a knowledge of other languages would have access to goods, information and culture from other countries,"" the EC said.
Translation has also enabled us to enjoy books, songs, films, TV series, or computer games in foreign languages — fostering cross-cultural awareness and knowledge in the process.
How else could we have enjoyed the poems of the Chilean Pablo Neruda, the fairy tales of the Danish Hans Christian Andersen or sought wisdom in holy books like the Bhagavad Gita or the Bible?
In terms of songs, the original German Christmas carol, ""Stille Nacht"" or ""Silent Night"" was declared Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO in 2011 and is reportedly the most translated carol to date. 
Meanwhile, the Oscar-winning ""Let It Go"" from Disney's 2013 hit animated film ""Frozen,"" has been recorded in 41 languages, including Flemish, Bahasa Malaysia and Vietnamese. Disney even put together a video showing this multilingual project that spliced together some international versions of the song being sung in French, German, Dutch and Mandarin among others. 
In the gaming world, Japanese company Nintendo's ""Mario"" and ""Donkey Kong"" made global inroads via translation — although gaming fans have highlighted slip ups in text over the years.
During the height of the COVID pandemic lockdown, people stuck at home turned to streaming services and gained access to new worlds through subtitled foreign language series and films from all over the world, from Iceland to India.
The South Korean series ""Squid Game"" soared to the #1 spot on Netflix's TV show charts in 22 countries upon its release on September 17, 2021. Having pulled in a staggering 1.65 billion hours of viewing in 28 days following its premiere, it remains the streaming giant's most viewed series, with the US produced English-language ""Stranger Things"" coming in second. 
The methods of translating have also evolved over time — from scholars in ancient times laboriously reproducing text from the original language to the target language to phrasebooks and audio cassettes and discs that we could speak along with, to computer technologies like DeepL and Google Translate that assist human translators today. 
From literal translations, that are still often retained for historic, academic, scientific and religious materials, the art of translating has also evolved to now include interpretative and localized translations that adapt an original core message to the cultural context or realities of target audiences.

https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-state-opera-thielemann-to-succeed-barenboim-as-conductor/a-66958370,MUSIC,Berlin State Opera: Thielemann to succeed Barenboim as conductor 29.09.2023,"In January, Daniel Barenboim, who shaped Berlin's State Opera as general music director for 30 years, resigned for health reasons. After months of uncertainty, it is now clear that Wagner and Henze expert Christian Thielemann will take over the prestigious role next year.
Berlin's Senator for Culture Joe Chialo, who is also the chairman of the Berlin Opera Foundation, thereby followed the recommendation of the opera's future artistic director, Elisabeth Sobotka, who will be leading the house from September 2024.
Thielemann has been chief conductor of the Staatskapelle Dresden since 2012. But his contract there expires in 2024. His new contract at the Berlin State Opera will initially run for five years. From 2025, some 20 concert evenings per year are planned.
However, just one opera premiere has been announced by Sobotka. The reason for this is Thielemann's previously made commitments elsewhere for the coming season.

Barenboim and Thielemann have known each other for decades. Already as a 19-year-old, Thielemann was assistant to the Argentine-Israeli composer and conductor.
In a welcoming address, the latter praised his successor as one of the outstanding conductors of the time: ""I have been at the helm of these so special musical institutions for over 30 years and I am certain that under Christian Thielemann's leadership they will continue to maintain and expand their exceptional position in Berlin and international musical life,"" Barenboim said. He was ""full of anticipation for what is to come."" Sobotka called Thielemann a ""logical successor"" to Barenboim.
Thielemann is not lacking in ambition. He wants the orchestra to play ""everything — from the Christmas Oratorio to the Happening.""
Nevertheless, he doesn't want to abandon tradition either. ""You can only do something new if you have both feet in the tradition,"" he said.
The 64-year-old and Daniel Barenboim have ""a close relationship,"" Thielemann told the media. Barenboim's influence on his career has been crucial, saying: ""I am in his debt.""
Still, there have been asides in their long artistic and private relationship. The New York Times speaks of a ""complicated history"": when Thielemann was at the Deutsche Oper, for example, he complained about the much lower level of state support for it compared to Barenboim's Staatsoper. In addition, accusations were made that Thielemann had made antisemitic comments about Barenboim. However, Thielemann vehemently denied this.
The Berlin State Opera, or Staatsoper Unter den Linden, is a renowned house. The neoclassical theater was modeled on an ancient temple and was once the largest opera house in Europe.
No less a figure than Frederick the Great, a great friend of the arts and sciences, commissioned the construction of the State Opera.
Completed in 1743 by architect Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, the building was part of a large-scale urban development project, the Forum Fridericianum, which also included a library, a church and a palace.
The State Opera House has had an eventful history. It had to be rebuilt several times. In 1843 it burned down almost to the ground. During World War II, the building was massively damaged twice and then reconstructed.
The German capital maintains three state-funded opera houses: in addition to the Staatsoper, the Deutsche Oper in former West Berlin and the smaller Komische Oper. That's more than Paris, New York and London.
All three opera houses are known for putting innovative and avant-garde productions on the program. Violence and nudity are considered pillars of this, as are performances that cross boundaries between opera, film and contemporary art.
In the days of the GDR, the Staatsoper was the leading opera house in East Germany. According to findings by historian Ralf Stabel, it was teeming with spies from the GDR secret service at the time.
In his book on the subject, Stabel wrote that many dancers spied on their colleagues to prevent the threatened escape of the best dancers to the West.
After reunification in 1990, the Staatsoper was handed over to the city of Berlin.
Starting in 2010, for several years the State Opera made a guest appearance at the Schillertheater in western Berlin. The reason was a comprehensive renovation of the building, whose time and cost schedule was massively exceeded, but at the end of which the audience was rewarded by breathtaking acoustics.

Christian Thielemann should now also be looking forward to these acoustics, which he is already familiar with. He has already stepped in as conductor twice before at the Staatsoper, when Barenboim was unable to conduct the Wagner cycle ""Der Ring des Nibelungen,"" due to health reasons. At the time, the audience had celebrated Thielemann with ovations, and the orchestra was also visibly taken with him. The beginning of his first rehearsal with the Staatskapelle, as the house's orchestra is called, was a ""magical moment,"" Thielemann says in retrospect.
After holding positions at the Deutsche Oper Berlin and Düsseldorf, Thielemann came to Nuremberg as general music director in 1988.
In 1997, he went to Berlin as general music director of the Deutsche Oper before holding the same post with the Munich Philharmonic, from 2004 to 2011. In addition to his post as principal conductor of the Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden, he was artistic director of the Salzburg Easter Festival from 2013 to 2022. In 2022, he stood at the podium of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and performed Bruckner's Eighth Symphony.
It will not be easy for Christian Thielemann to succeed Barenboim, but the stage is set for him to further add to his burgeoning reputation.

""Poland is a stalwart US Ally, and Poland's security is vital to the collective defense of NATO's Eastern Flank,"" the US State Department said in a statement on Monday.
Poland shares a long border with Belarus — a key Russian ally — which has been a source of heated tension at the edge of both the EU and NATO.
""In addition to its central support role in facilitating international assistance to neighboring Ukraine, Poland has demonstrated its ironclad commitment to strengthening regional security through its robust investments in defense spending,"" the US State Department added.
Beyond Warsaw's issues with Minsk, the NATO member was an early supporter of arming Ukraine against the Russian invasion and has provided the war-torn country with a large number of tanks, fighter jets and other equipment.
But amid Russia's aggression, Warsaw is seeking to bolster its defense capabilities.
To replace the largely Soviet-era equipment that it handed over, Poland is now looking for state-of-the-art military technology from US and South Korean defense companies.

The Biden administration is also providing Warsaw up to $60 million for the cost of the loan in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) which would support ""urgent procurements of defense articles and services from the United States,"" the State Department said.
Poland is aiming to spend 4% of its economic output on defense this year — twice the mark set by the Western defense alliance.
Despite Warsaw's early staunch support for Kyiv, a recent spat over Ukrainian grain being brought onto the Polish market led Prime Minister Mateus Morawiecki to proclaim that Poland would no longer be providing Ukraine with weapons.
Experts have pointed out that this is likely pre-election rhetoric from the right-wing populist ruling party since Poland has already given almost everything it can give.
The US has tried to play down the incident, highlighting Poland's interest in a Ukrainian victory over Russia, amid concerns that Western support may be starting to wane as the war goes on with little end in sight.

The Munich District Court found the 30-year-old guilty of three completed and one attempted case of illegally selling cultural property and sentenced him to a suspended prison term of one year and nine months, the court announced on Monday.
The court also ordered the confiscation of more than €60,000 ($63,500) in compensation.
The defendant was a technical employee from May 2016 to April 2018 at the museum and had access to the storage room where paintings were kept. According to the court, he replaced the painting ""Das Märchen vom Froschkönig"" (The Fairy Tale of the Frog King) by Franz von Stuck with a forgery.
Pretending that the painting had belonged to his great-grandparents or grandparents, he offered the original for auction at a Munich auction house, which sold the painting for €70,000 ($74,000) to a gallery in Switzerland. He was left with €49,127.40 in cash after the deduction of auction costs.
He also stole the paintings ""Die Weinprüfung"" (Tasting the Wine) by Eduard von Grützner and ""Zwei Mädchen beim Holzsammeln im Gebirge"" (Two Girls Gathering Wood in the Mountains) by Franz von Defregger from the museum's storage. The paintings brought him a further total of around €12,000.
In total, the defendant collected €60,617 euros for the pictures. He spent the money to pay off debts and finance a luxurious lifestyle. According to the court, among other things, the man bought himself ""a new flat, expensive wristwatches and ... a Rolls Royce.""
In court, the man had reportedly not only confessed but also shown ""sincere remorse and insight.""
""He stated that he had acted without thinking. He could no longer explain his behavior,"" the court reported. The verdict is final.

https://www.dw.com/en/devils-and-demons-new-exhibition-looks-at-the-art-of-horror/a-66844810,CULTURE,Devils and demons: New exhibition looks at the art of horror 24.09.2023,"Since time immemorial, horror has found its way into various art forms, whether in fairy tales, books, paintings, sculptures, songs or films. 
Despite this long tradition, horror has long been denigrated for being a superficial genre. Curator Westrey Page hopes to demonstrate that is not the case with the exhibition ""Death and the Devil. The Fascination with Horror,"" on show at the Kunstpalast Düsseldorf.
In recent decades, the topic has only appeared marginally in major exhibitions, as Page tells DW. Unique in its approach, the exhibition explores how horror has inspired creators in all artistic fields, from fine art to fashion, from music to film.
The exhibition begins with a historical prologue that looks into how the arts and culture have been shaped by horror for centuries, from the fantastic demons of the Renaissance to the dark shadows in Romantic landscape paintings to various iconic characters from the early horror films of the 20th century, such as Nosferatu.
The prologue shows that throughout history, major artists such as Albrecht Dürer, Friedrich Wilhelm von Schadow and Francisco de Goya also dealt with horror and dark dreams in their works.
""Above all, my hope is that many visitors will then be able to interpret today's manifestations of horror differently, and perhaps have more respect for them,"" says the exhibition's curator.
Through 120 exhibits — paintings, illustrations and installations from various art forms from the past two centuries — ""Death and the Devil. The Fascination with Horror"" shows how certain horror devices have been revisited over time.
Excerpts from German Expressionist horror film classics such as ""Nosferatu"" (1922) or ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" (1920) and posters from famous later horror classics such as ""The Exorcist"" (1973) or ""Halloween"" (1978) show the continuity with which horror has been inscribed in film history:

Horror films can promote both conservative and subversive values. They can, for example, serve as a warning about the unknown, but they can also enable a change of perspective about social issues by asking the question: Who is the actual monster here?
Ever since the first ""King Kong"" film, the old hero-versus-monster formula has been challenged.
In many modern vampire films, the bloodsuckers are no longer the villains, but rather the main protagonists who have to find their way in a cruel society.
A recurring theme in horror is that a central unit is threatened by something that comes from the outside.
But this established storyline can also be used to swap roles, in which ""the monster, the witch, the vampire or the outsider can assert an empowered otherness,"" explains Westrey Page. ""And this can also be used to question social norms, to question systems of power. And that's ultimately what we're seeing more and more of in horror these days, in very different genres, including pop culture.""
The exhibition shows, among other things, how the looks of the younger Goth scene influenced the creations of fashion designers such as Rei Kawakubo, Rick Owens and Viktor & Rolf.
The aesthetics of Gothic, Wave and especially Metal bands — whether on their record covers, their band T-shirts or the lettering used for their names — are heavily inspired by old myths that deal with horror and disgust.
Today, this symbolism also appears in pop music. Lady Gaga, for example, lovingly refers to her fans as ""Little Monsters.""
Horror has been going through a renaissance in recent years, which is reflected among other things in the great international success of series such as ""The Walking Dead,"" or ""Monster High,"" a popular horror doll series from the Barbie manufacturer Mattel, in which figures like Frankie Stein or Draculaura wreak havoc. The franchise's advertising slogan is: ""Be yourself, be unique, be a monster.""
""So it's about celebrating and accepting one's own identity and differences,"" says Page.
When preparing the exhibition, she herself was surprised by the diversity of the horror genre: ""It can be serious, it can be socio-political, but it can also be charming. Horror can be fun, filled with black humor. It's just so diverse.""
A sculpture by the US artist King Cobra with imitation flesh that explores the vulnerability of the body and the disgust that arises from it; an album cover by Lady Gaga, who is part motorcycle, part human; Max Schreck as Count Orlok in ""Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror"": All three works cross borders, and can open the mind of the viewers through a moment of shock.
""I think that horror gives us space to process our own fears and ultimately see our society from a different perspective,"" says Page.
The exhibition ""Death and the Devil. The Fascination with Horror"" is on through to January 21, 2024 at the Kunstpalast in Düsseldorf. Recommended for ages 12 and up.

https://www.dw.com/en/nudity-blood-and-pain-revisiting-marina-abramovics-work/a-59975893,CULTURE,"Nudity, blood and pain: Revisiting Marina Abramovic's work 22.09.2023","The UK's Royal Academy of Arts is dedicating a major exhibition to iconic Serbian performance artist Marina Abramovic. It is the first retrospective to be given to a female artist in the institution's history.
The exhibition revisits Abramovic's artistic legacy through sculpture, video, installation and performance. Different works are re-staged through video archive footage; others are reperformed by a new generation of artists.
Born in Belgrade, Serbia in 1946, Marina Abramovic studied art both in her hometown and in Zagreb, Croatia. Early on she developed an interest in performance art, including experiments with sound installations.
In 1973, the young artist was invited to Edinburgh, Scotland, for an international art festival, where she debuted her first provocative performance work.
Titled ""Rhythm 10,"" Abramovic thrust 10 sharp knives between her splayed fingers — a daredevil act in which she occasionally missed and drew blood. In Edinburgh, where the young artist and occasional painter met iconic German performance artist Joseph Beuys, she also realized she had found her medium.
""I had experienced absolute freedom — I had felt that my body was without boundaries, limitless; that pain didn't matter, that nothing mattered at all — and it all intoxicated me,"" recalled Abramovic of that first performance in her 2016 autobiography, ""Walk Through Walls.""
""I was drunk from the overwhelming energy that I'd received. That was the moment I knew that I had found my medium. No painting, no object that I could make, could ever give me that kind of feeling, and it was a feeling I knew I would have to seek out, again and again and again.""












Abramovic has since carved a reputation as a pioneering performance artist who continues to test her physical and psychological limits.
Arguably her most provocative early work was 1974's ""Rhythm 0,"" a performance in Italy, this time in Naples. In it, Abramovic directed the audience: ""There are 72 objects on the table that one can use on me as desired.""
The objects included razor blades, knives and a loaded gun. The artist sat motionless as people cut open her clothes or slashed her skin. One person aimed the loaded gun at her head. ""If you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you,"" Abramovic said after the performance in which she sought to expose an inherent human cruelty.
Earlier that year, her performance ""Rhythm 5"" included a burning communist star. She laid herself in the middle of it after cutting and burning her hair and nails. When the fire had consumed all the oxygen, Abramovic passed out.
This career path was soon taken in tandem with German artist Frank ""Ulay"" Uwe Laysiepen, who in 1976 became Abramovic's lover and collaborator for 12 years.
The 1977 performance ""Imponderabilia"" was typical of their oeuvre; Abramovic and Ulay stood at the entrance of a Bologna museum naked, forcing visitors to squeeze past them to enter.
This work is now reperformed by other artists at the Royal Academy. Here too, visitors must squeeze between two nude models to enter the show. There is, however, a separate entrance for those who are uncomfortable with participating in the unusual performance.
Marina Abramovic and Ulay lived as free spirits in their small Citroen bus for four years, traveling through Europe and performing.
Even their separation in 1988 was sealed with an elaborate performance. In a piece titled ""The Lovers,"" they walked towards each other along the Great Wall of China, starting at opposite ends and meeting in the middle. After covering some 4,000 kilometers (2485 miles), they said goodbye.
The separation inspired the artist to break new ground.
In 1997, she performed a work in the international section of the Venice Biennale titled ""Balkan Baroque,"" a comment on the Yugoslav Wars, in which she spent seven hours a day washing a mountain of bloody cow bones. Her performance was awarded a Golden Lion.
Since the 1990s, she has also been teaching her ""Abramovic Method"" to young performance artists. She moved to New York in 2000, where she developed theater pieces, performances and encounters with other artists, despite some local reticence to her work.
In ""House with the Ocean View,"" the artist spent 12 days living without food in three open rooms, in which she created an intimate relationship between herself and viewers.
The theme continued in a 2010 performance at New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), ""The Artist is Present,"" in which she locked eyes with audience members at a table from a wooden stool in which she sat for six hours a day for 75 days — stars like Sharon Stone, Tilda Swinton, Björk and Lady Gaga made use of the chair.
Former lover Ulay, who she had not spoken to in years, famously showed up without warning and stared across at the star artist. They both cried. 
In the decade since, her works have been characterized less by violence and more by asceticism and recollection. Her method is based on a mix of various esoteric and eastern relaxation and meditation exercises. She spends every year's end in a monastery in India to meditate and recharge her batteries. ""We have to create situations where our bodies are healthy and function well,"" she said. 
The Serbian artist has been accused of trying to evolve from artist to shaman, though she has also suffered much worse throughout a provocative career. In 2018, for instance, she was attacked with a portrait of herself while she held a book signing for, ""Marina Abramovic Interviews 1976-2018,"" in Florence, Italy. After the incident, she returned to her hometown of Belgrade to kick off her retrospective ""The Cleaner.""
In 2020, Abramovic debuted the operatic project, ""7 Deaths of Maria Callas,"" at Munich's Bayerische Staatsoper. In it, she re-enacted seven of Callas' most famous on-stage deaths. ""Like many of the opera heroines she created on stage, she, too, died of love. She died of a broken heart,"" said Abramovic of the star — whom she greatly admired. 
Earlier this year, the performance artist had a brush with death that wasn't induced by one of her extreme performances.
During a minor operation at the hospital in May, she suffered a pulmonary embolism that led her to undergo three operations and nine blood transfusions. She was in intensive care for six weeks, spending some time in a coma. 
To deal with the difficult episode, she used all the skills she had developed through her performances: ""breathing, dealing with pain, working with consciousness,"" she explained at the inauguration of the exhibition at the Royal Academy. 
""We are so afraid of pain. I don't like pain, but I think that pain is such an important element in human life,"" she said. ""Suffering is like a kind of gate in order to understand the universe, in order to understand yourself.""
The exhibition ""Marina Abramovic"" is on show from September 23, 2023 to January 1, 2024 at the Royal Academy in London.
This article is an updated version of a previous profile, first published for Marina Abramovic's 75th birthday on November 30, 2021.

https://www.dw.com/en/will-ai-revolutionize-or-ruin-video-games/a-66861937,CULTURE,Will AI revolutionize or ruin video games? 19.09.2023,"""That's ultimately the utopia of AI that I imagine: Everyone's just more creative. We'll have more beautiful digital experiences. People will become closer together through these shared creative experiences,"" says Sasha MacKinnon, founder and managing director of Mino Games. ""I think it's possible, we just got to do it right,"" adds the Australian, a self-confessed ""Pokemon nerd"" who started developing games at the age of six.
MacKinnon's enthusiasm is contagious; he beams as he talks about the opportunities that lie in the use of artificial intelligence — AI for short — in game development.
Many other gaming insiders have come to a similar conclusion. According to a study by management consultancy Bain & Company, published in September 2023, the majority of the gaming industry executives surveyed believe that AI will be involved in half of the development process in the next five to 10 years.
For example, in the role-playing game ""Dimensionals,"" developed by Sasha MacKinnon's studio, AI is built into a particular character who is a slightly crazy nice guy, brimming with creativity, who always joins the others at the table and keeps making one funny suggestion after the other.
AI can generate characters, fights and dialogues: ""We're using AI to have these magical moments where the characters just say something that you totally didn't expect that really isn't scripted and is based on your history of playing with them.""
For now, AI quickly reaches its limits: 40-50% of its suggestions are unusable, says MacKinnon. So at Mino Games, AI serves as creative collaborator who provides ideas that are then implemented by humans.
The sketches of the monsters for ""Dimensionals"" were generated by AI, but the monsters that appear in the game were created by human designers.
Game developers don't have to worry about their jobs, says MacKinnon. They cannot be replaced by AI, he believes, adding that ""games are the purest form of human expression,"" as they not only combine story, art and sound, they also offer ""an experience for people. AI will never, ever be able to do that as well.""
Daniel Landes does not share this optimism. He works as a freelance translator and adapts international games into German, including ""Hogwarts Legacy"" and ""Overwatch 2.""
Translators usually work as freelancers and are paid per word. Nobody gets rich from it. But now, as the use of AI is being required by game producers, they are also expecting translators to be paid less for their work — only 30% of the original per word price.
Translators would like to use the AI tools as an aid, like mathematicians use a calculator, explains Landes. ""The main problem is that we are forced to work for less money, even though it is not proven that work will be made easier."" The more complex a text is, the worse the computer translation, requiring more editing work. ""The machine doesn't understand context, but rather calculates probabilities,"" says Landes. ""Especially with dialogues or creative texts, it's not about translating literally, but about capturing the meaning of the original. AI cannot do that.""
The umbrella organization for audiovisual translators in Europe, AVTE, published a manifesto on AI translations in 2021, in which Daniel Landes was also involved. The authors warn of a loss of quality, question the efficiency of the tools and demand fair pay for translators.
However, there has been no improvement in the general conditions so far. ""Because most translators are freelancers, it is incredibly difficult to organize as a profession. Many translators have to struggle very much to even make ends meet.""
It's not just in Germany that the profession is facing difficult times. ""All translators worldwide are under pressure,"" says  Landes. ""We see the same problems everywhere: Our names are not mentioned in the credits, our fees keep being lowered and we have no say or right to negotiate.""
AI is only as good as the data it is fed with. In addition, it is by no means certain that AI will improve over time. It can also get worse, as researchers have found using ChatGPT as an example.
It is therefore not unreasonable to think that the quality of games will be affected if AI is increasingly used.
But since the technology is often faster and significantly cheaper than human translators, game designers or copywriters, it could still prevail and lead to people losing their jobs and studios simply accepting lower quality as the lesser evil.
""One of the biggest risks of AI is that people become complacent,"" says game developer MacKinnon. ""And this is one of the big things about AI in general: We're at these crossroads. You know, it could be the best thing that happens or it could really damage humanity.""
We should not blindly rely on AI, he points out, but rather use it as a tool, for example, for inspiration. And it should encourage people to develop their own stories and games. He expects a flood of new games from people who have never developed a game before, but are now able to do so thanks to the technical possibilities.
In fact, the most successful games in recent years have come about because existing games were modified and further developed by the community — i.e. by the players themselves, not by the game industry.
Among others, ""Counter-Strike"" emerged from a modification of the first-person shooter game ""Half-Life.""
""Fortnite"" is a variant of ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds,"" whose battle royale concept — 100 players compete against each other and the last survivor wins — was invented by a so-called ""modder,"" a term used to describe those who redesign games by creating new levels and maps.
One possible scenario is that using AI in game development will create more games, but the quality will drop, which means that more boring, mediocre games will be released.
On average, more than 30 new games are already appearing on the Steam gaming platform every day.
Additionally, AI — which can handle all tasks of game development, from graphics to copywriting to programming — makes it much easier for everyone to develop a game.
This means that more user-generated content could emerge in the coming years, which may also create new, successful genres.
After all, the development of technology — which was initially rather limited — has always had a significant influence on game development, starting with text adventures in the 1980s, followed by 2D platforms with pixel graphics in the 1990s, then detailed open-world games in the 2000s, and now popular multiplayer online games, which bring together dozens of players at the same time.

https://www.dw.com/en/how-louis-armstrong-left-his-mark-in-east-germany-in-1965/a-66817527,MUSIC,How Louis Armstrong left his mark in East Germany in 1965 18.09.2023,"In March 1965, Louis Armstrong came to East Germany for a series of concerts. It was a tightly packed tour: The jazz superstar performed 17 shows in nine days in five different cities of the communist German Democratic Republic (GDR).
Around 45,000 East Germans saw him play live with his All Stars band.
The political background behind Armstrong's concert series turned it into an event that was both ""outstanding and ambivalent,"" said Paola Malavassi, co-curator of a new exhibition that takes the historic event as a starting point. ""I've Seen the Wall — Louis Armstrong on Tour in the GDR 1965,"" is now on show at Das Minsk, an art museum in the former East German city of Potsdam, right outside Berlin.
The Berlin Wall had been built less than four years earlier by the GDR; the satellite state of the Soviet Union was aiming to stop the ""brain drain"" of educated and skilled workers from the East to the West.
Amid Cold War propaganda, the GDR's ruling Socialist Unity Party increasingly hardened its stance toward popular music throughout the 1950s and 1960s. By the end of 1965, during its plenary session, the party officially unveiled its hard line against all cultural manifestations that were deemed to promote the West's ""nihilistic"" and ""pornographic"" values.
Jazz was also viewed suspiciously. GDR leader Walter Ulbricht is said to have described it as ""the ape music of imperialism.""
But the GDR authorities' attitude toward the music genre also fluctuated from the 1950s to the 1970s, with some officials recognizing its power as the ""people's music"" because of its African American roots. 
""Satchmo,"" as Armstrong was nicknamed, had been invited by the Deutsche Künstler Agentur, the GDR state agency in charge of determining which foreign musicians could perform in East Germany, as well as which East German artists were allowed to play abroad.
Politically-toned speeches were held upon Armstrong's arrival in Berlin. The head of the GDR artists' agency, Ernst Zielke, praised the musician's visit as a symbol of peace and socialism, calling it a celebration of the working class and friendship between peoples.
On the other hand, the United States was also keen to send jazz musicians to Soviet countries, as ""goodwill ambassadors.""
The GDR had allowed the Armstrong concerts to take place in halls with a capacity of 2,000 to 3,000 seats, but it had also assigned the Stasi, East Germany's secret police, to surveil the concertgoers, fearing riots.
The tour is remembered as having given a boost to the East German jazz scene, with the music genre serving as a symbol of freedom, as noted by jazz musician Jason Moran, co-curator of ""I've Seen the Wall,"" in a podcast released as part of the exhibition.
The title of the exhibition refers to a statement made by Armstrong at a press conference in East Berlin during the tour.
A West German journalist asked him to comment on the Berlin Wall dividing the city. In his answer, Armstrong avoided the political debate: ""I've seen the Wall … and I'm not worried about the Wall … I'm worried about the audience I'm going to play to tomorrow night!""
However, he then added, ""I can't say what I want to say, but if you'll accept it, forget about all that other bulls***t.""
The interpreter nervously chuckled, and did not translate Armstrong's reference to self-censorship into German, simply mentioning the singer's use of a ""strong expression"" along with his call to concentrate on the music.   
Zielke, the director of the GDR's artists agency, promptly closed the topic at the press conference by stating: ""Anyhow, it's interesting that the only political question of this kind is not from us, but from a Western outlet. We are delighted to note this.""
Just as interestingly, even though they didn't refer to the GDR's state of affairs, all previous questions by East German journalists were equally political.
They were rather interested in finding out Armstrong's stance toward the civil rights movement. Just as the influential trumpet player was touring East Germany, the Selma to Montgomery marches were taking place in the US. The non-violent protests, held to demonstrate against the racial repression of African Americans, had Martin Luther King Jr. as their figurehead.
A few months previously, in September 1964, King had given speeches in West and East Berlin. In both parts of the divided city, he advocated reconciliation; the pastor and social activist also compared the divisions between African Americans and white people in the US and those between Germans living in communist and democratic systems.
King's emphasis on their common struggles was particularly moving for East Berliners — but made US officials nervous. The GDR and the Soviet Union often highlighted how racial violence in the US was a sign of the failure of the American society; East Germans were strong supporters of the civil rights movement. 
Asked about the marches, Armstrong explained that his contribution to the movement was rather to play everywhere in his home country and to build connections with his white fans, even in the racially segregated South. ""I just do my little part, which some of them [the activists] don't do. But I do,"" he said at the East Berlin press conference.
By then, Satchmo was somewhat embittered of being accused by fellow Black Americans of not doing enough for the civil rights movement. Though the jazz icon mainly avoided politics, he did famously criticize the government's lack of action in the Little Rock Nine case in 1957, when nine Black students enrolled at a formerly all-white school in Arkansas faced horrendous treatment by those who were protesting against desegregation.












Many African American activists had maligned the jazz superstar for not being vocal enough, but as co-curator Moran noted, they came back over time and said, ""Well, actually, Louis was most profound in his activism."" They had by then realized that there are different ways people could manage to ""get in the room to spark change.""
And for Moran, that's what Armstrong did. As one of the first Black superstars in the US and internationally, Armstrong found ""his way inside rooms in a way that the person on the street doesn't. And they do need each other as a community of activists to spark a kind of change, possible change.""
""I've Seen the Wall. Louis Armstrong on Tour in the GDR 1965"" is on view at Das Minsk from September 16, 2023, through February 4, 2024.

https://www.dw.com/en/derna-the-libyan-city-known-for-rebellion-and-neglect/a-66822261,CATASTROPHE,Derna: The Libyan city known for rebellion — and neglect 15.09.2023,"Throughout its history, the coastal Libyan city of Derna has been both feared and revered.
Founded in the late 15th century on site of an ancient Greek colony, the eastern port city was well-known as a center of intellectualism and independent thinking, cosmopolitanism, art and culture. Home to around 100,000 people, it was also renowned for its attractive location on the Mediterranean coast, flanked by some of arid Libya's only green forests.
After this week's catastrophic flooding, experts have said the city's historical reputation and its desirable coastal location were decisive factors contributing to the major devastation and high number of deaths — over 11,000 and still rising, with many more still missing — caused by Storm Daniel.
In 2011, during the so-called Arab Spring, Derna locals, along with people in the neighboring coastal city of Benghazi, about 350 kilometers (217 miles) to the west, were some of the first to demonstrate against the country's 42-year dictatorship.
Over the decades, Libya's authoritarian ruler Moammar Gadhafi had built up a loyal power base in the west of the country, networked around the city of Tripoli. Gadhafi had not paid as much attention to the east, and cities like Derna and Benghazi had long suffered from policies of economic exclusion.
This was also partially because the people of Derna had expressed opposition to Gadhafi's rule since the 1970s. The city's revolutionary reputation was also molded by individuals who favored more rigid forms of Islamand, united by their religious values, would eventually fight Gadhafi. In return, the dictator brutalized Derna and left its infrastructure to crumble.
In the 1990s, men from Derna joined the anti-Gadhafi Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, or LIFG. Gadhafi launched a brutal crackdown in Derna, sending people door-to-door to find LIFG members. The dictator also meted out blanket punishment by demolishing homes and cutting off water and power to the city. In 1996, many of the victims of an infamous jail massacre in Tripoli were from Derna.
""The city eroded progressively — no schools, and the hospitals were in very poor condition, neglected infrastructure,"" Hani Shennib, president of the National Council of US-Libya Relations, told the BBC this week.
A Guardian journalist visiting Derna in 2011 noted that, ""Derna's apartments and office blocks are shabby compared with elsewhere in the country, and sewage leaks on the main streets.""
This neglect has continued over the years, Hussein bin Dish, a city official from Derna, told journalists from the European Broadcasting Union: ""Nothing is working here, no national authorities, nothing,"" he said angrily. ""Have a look and do something about it! We are experiencing a great injustice.""
During Libya's 2011 revolution, Gadhafi often repeated claims that protests in Derna were being incited by Islamist extremists and groups like al-Qaeda.
Experts have argued the city's oppositional attitude only partially stems from its being a center for hard-line Islamist dissent. It also comes from Derna's long tradition of intellectualism and counterculture.
After the Gadhafi regime was pushed out of power in 2011, Derna was — like the rest of Libya — at the mercy of various militias and fighting groups. One of Derna's most powerful groups was the Abu Salim Martyrs Brigade, founded by a former LIFG member.
In 2014, defectors from this powerful militia pledged allegiance to the extremist ""Islamic State"" group and took control of Derna. Their ""rule was marked largely by beheadings and other forms of execution, or acts of public humiliation,"" Andrew McGregor, a Canadian expert on security issues in the Islamic world, wrote in a 2018 report for the Jamestown Foundation, a US think tank.
Others in the city fought back but it wasn't until 2016 that ""Islamic State"" was finally pushed out of the city altogether. Unfortunately for civilians in Derna, that wasn't the end of the fighting.
Libya has been split into two since 2014, with opposing governments located in the east and west of the country respectively. A United Nations-backed administration known as the Government of National Unity is based in Tripoli in the west, and its rival, known as the House of Representatives, is based in the east, in Tobruk.
Libyan warlord, Khalifa Haftar, whose Libyan National Army, or LNA, controlled much of the eastern half of the country, also wanted to take Derna. His forces besieged the city in 2015, even while the Islamist groups were still fighting inside it. It wasn't until 2018 that Haftar's forces managed to take control.
The fighting in Derna was brutal but the international community averted its eyes from what was happening, McGregor noted, because it had ""no particular objection to the elimination of this long-time Islamist hotbed.""
Even after the violence ended in 2018, Derna would continue to be ignored and neglected by those in power in eastern Libya because it was still known as rebellious city.
""Libyans are in shock and blame corrupt administrations who squabble over power instead of governing, as well as embezzling funds earmarked to rebuild Derna after the 2018 war [and] ignoring warnings over the dams,"" Tarek Megerisi, a senior policy fellow with the Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, wrote this week.
Experts said Haftar still doesn't trust the people of Derna, fearing the seeds of another revolution may still lie dormant inside the city.
In fact, earlier this month, Derna's municipal elections were canceled, which allows the LNA to remain in power there, as Anas El Gomati, director of the Libyan think tank Sadeq Institute, told DW.
""The local elections that should have taken place several weeks ago in Derna were canceled in favor of the military [who will be] ruling for five more years,"" he explained. ""But what have they done in the past five years, apart from plunder the economy, destroy the city and sell the scrap metal for a billion dollars?"" he asked, referring to a 2019 report by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime that looked at how the LNA was funded.
Derna's vaunted scenic location was also a factor in the flooding that devastated the city this week. Dotted with ancient churches and mosques, famous for its agriculture and bordered by beaches, the city is built on what is known as an alluvial fan. This is where land is formed at the bottom of mountains by sediment that's being washed down rivers and streams toward the sea. The city is split in two by a river, or ""wadi,"" that is dry most of the year.
This kind of geography is prone to floods and Derna has experienced many over the years. In 1941, during World War II, a deluge swept away German tanks and soldiers stationed on the outskirts of Derna. There were also major floods in 1956, 1959, 1968 and 1986, with the overflows in 1959 having been the worst until now.
Regular flooding was why Derna's two dams, named Mansour and Derna, were built between 1973 and 1977 by Hidrotehnika-Hidroenergetika, a company from the former Yugoslavia. The dams were a form of flood control as well as a way to manage soil erosion and irrigate surrounding farmlands, the company reported.
Derna's last flood occurred in 2011, after local authorities tried unsuccessfully to drain water from the dams. But even before that, it was clear to Derna locals that the dams had not been properly managed for years. It's unclear when the dams last underwent maintenance. It could have been in 2002, locals have told journalists, or as far back as 1983. 
But , as one Derna man told the European Broadcasting Union, ""we warned the authorities for weeks — no, years — that the dam had cracks in it and needed maintenance. We said it and nobody listened to us. Now the whole of Derna is flooded,"" he lamented.
Despite this, the dams also gave some Derna residents a false sense of security. The city has grown in an unplanned, haphazard way and buildings erected or extended into areas that previously flooded regularly.
But when the harsh reality of this week's floods came, it was not simply a matter of poor maintenance. Hydrological experts have also pointed out that the dams were simply not built to deal with such heavy rainfall, having been constructed before the effects of  climate change took hold.

https://www.dw.com/en/has-iran-changed-1-year-after-the-death-of-jina-mahsa-amini/a-66822599,SOCIETY,Has Iran changed 1 year after the death of Jina Mahsa Amini? 15.09.2023,"Ahead of the first anniversary of Jina Mahsa Amini's death on September 16, her family wrote on Instagram that they intended to mourn at Amini's grave site.
Amini's relatives, like any grieving family, want to hold a religious and traditional funeral service for their beloved daughter, the statement added.
However, since last year, Iranian authorities have closely surveilled Amini's family. In recent days, armed forces have been deployed around the family's home in the city of Saqqez, according to reports. 
Iranian authorities are not only watching Amini's family. They also monitor many cemeteries where people killed in protests have been laid to rest. Iranian authorities want to prevent crowds, claiming protests could break out.
Exact figures are difficult to obtain, but according to independent human rights organizations, police forces in Iran have killed at least 527 protesters, including 17 minors, during protests between September 16, 2022, and the end of January 2023. Families of people killed during demonstrations are under enormous pressure.
""We have never seen this kind of widespread arrest and detention of victims' family members before,"" human rights activist Shiva Nazar Ahari told DW.
Ahari is a member of the Iranian Committee for Human Rights. She has been arrested repeatedly over the past decades and imprisoned for several years. She has lived in Slovenia since October 2018.
""So far, more than 40 relatives of the victims have been arrested. And the number of arrests is increasing every day,"" Ahari says.
""Political and social activists are either in jail, being interrogated or threatened. It may be that these methods temporarily prevent further protests.""
Jina Mahsa Amini was arrested last year during a trip to Tehran, the Iranian capital, and taken to a police station, allegedly for not wearing her headscarf appropriately. In Iran, women are strictly required to wear headscarves in public.

A few hours later, Amini was taken lifeless from police custody to the hospital. Three days later, on September 16, she was officially declared dead.
The mass protest movement began with Amini's funeral in her hometown of Saqqez, located in a Kurdish region in western Iran, and quickly spread throughout the country.
The participants, mostly young women, removed their headscarves under the motto: ""Woman, Life, Freedom.""
These widespread rallies developed into the largest and longest-running protest movement since the founding of the Islamic Republic in 1979. The ruling regime responded with massive repression and violence.
Human rights activist Ahari is convinced that these protests have permanently changed political and social relations in Iranian society.
One of the most significant changes concerns Iranian women taking liberties with their appearance in public.
Despite the threat of stricter punitive measures such as fines, many women refuse to wear the mandatory headscarf.
They see the headscarf as a symbol of systematic oppression and humiliation and no longer wish to bow to the rules associated with it.
Since the Islamic Revolution, the image of women has played an essential role in state ideology. A woman without a hijab is seen as a symbol of a permissive Western lifestyle and is considered by conservative forces to be a cultural attack against Islamic culture.
The image of women propagated by the political system is someone who not only wears the hijab but submits and subordinates herself.

Iranian women have been discriminated against for several decades in Iran. This is also confirmed by the World Economic Forum Foundation's (WEF) 2022 Gender Gap Report, with Iran ranking 143 out of 146 countries.
The WEF examines gender equality in business, education, health and politics. Women's political participation, in particular, also plays a crucial role in this ranking.
""We are dealing with a progressive movement that will bear fruit in the long term,"" said internationally renowned Iranian sculptor Barbad Golshiri, who now lives in Paris.
As the son of the contemporary writer Houshang Golshiri, the sculptor is well-connected in the Iranian cultural and art scene.
""The 'Woman, Life, Freedom' movement is just leading to a cultural revolution from the lowest layer of society. It challenges values that the despots have been trying to impose on their society from above since the 1980s,"" Golshiri told DW.
At that time, during Iran's Islamic Revolution, the country's rulers had Islamized the education system, forced women to wear headscarves in public, and exiled or arrested independent cultural figures and academics. In the late 1980s, political prisoners were executed en masse.
""The political system now wants to intimidate society using the methods of the 1980s,"" Golshiri said. He refers to methods like the recent mass imprisonment of protesters, death sentences against political prisoners, and the dismissal of critical scholars from educational institutions.
Iran's parliament approved a controversial law on August 22 imposing harsher penalties for disobeying the Islamic dress code.
These include up to 15 years in prison for multiple violations. The publication of photos of women without headscarves on the Internet is also punishable. In addition, there are plans to ban women from leaving the country. The judiciary has threatened to close supermarkets, restaurants or museums that allow women without headscarves to enter.
In contrast, religiously observant women are to be better protected under the law. Anyone who insults veiled women will be put behind bars for six months and receive 74 lashes. In this way, Iran's rulers try to drive a wedge into the population.
Old dogmas are being challenged by the protest movement that emerged a year ago, which also traces its roots to the global women's rights movement, Golshiri said.
The death of Jina Mahsa Amini was also felt by Iranians abroad. In October 2022, for example, exiled Iranians in Germany organized a solidarity rally in Berlin.
According to police estimates, around 80,000 people took part in the protest. As a sign of recognition, Iranian opposition activists were represented on the podiums instead of government representatives for the first time at the Munich Security Conference in February 2023.
""Forming an opposition inside Iran is very difficult because of the repression by the security forces. Many expected or hoped that big names and personalities among the exiled Iranians would form an opposition,"" said Arash Azizi, a Middle East expert at New York University.
""There was a lot of disappointment when some personalities went their separate ways again after briefly joining forces.""
Among exiled Iranians, agreement seems to be very difficult. They are ultimately preoccupied with themselves. In my opinion, the decisive force for change in Iran itself lies with the many courageous people who are currently behind bars. Only they can make it happen.""

https://www.dw.com/en/namibias-first-opera-comes-to-berlin/a-66814274,CULTURE,Namibia's first opera comes to Berlin 15.09.2023,"Operatic productions have long been known to tackle complex themes of historical significance — from the French Revolution to the rise and fall of dictators like Julius Cesar.
The opera ""Chief Hijangua"" tells the story of German settlers in South West Africa, in what is present-day Namibia. This dark chapter of Germany's history has recently been the subject of films, art exhibitions and other theatrical works, and now, the first opera written by a Namibian composer will touch on this complicated history and what it means for the present relationship between the two countries.
Presented on September 15, 16 and 17 in Berlin's Haus des Rundfunks, the opera brings together performers from Namibia, South Africa and Germany, under the leadership of conductor and composer Eslon Hindundu, who leads the Rundfunk Symfonie Orchester Berlin, as well as Berlin's Cantus Domus Chor and Vox Vitae Musica, which is dedicated to Namibian choral music.
""Chief Hijangua"" premiered in the Namibian capital of Windhoek in September of 2022; this will mark its European debut.
Present-day Namibia, named at the time German South West Africa, became a German colony in 1884, despite the land being long inhabited by the Herero and Nama people.
In 1904, the Herero people rose up against German colonial rule, and German military commander General Lothar von Trotha issued a notorious ""extermination order,"" which led to what has gone down in the history books as the one of the earliest and biggestgenocides of the 20th century. 
The opera ""Chief Hijangua"" is set in an imaginary world that resembles the late 19th century and the landscape is similar to that of Namibia. It tells the story of Chief Hijangua's journey to find himself and how he encounters the German settlers. Yet ""Chief Hijangua"" does not directly tell the story of the genocide, explains the opera's co-director, Michael Pulse.
""We're trying to avoid this idea that this story is based on somebody who has lived before, which is not the case. It is mirroring some of these events that have happened, but we do not tie it directly to the history of Namibia and Germany and the genocide, because it is set in a time period before that — when the German settlers arrived and these two cultures, the Germans and the Herero met for the first time,"" Pulse tells DW. In this sense, the opera is meant as a prequel to the horrors of the genocide on Namibian soil, he says.
In the Afrofuturistic world in which this opera is set, Germans and Namibians are united, explained Pauls. 
Performers were not cast based on nationality: ""The Germans and the Namibians are playing the villagers; and the Germans and the Namibians are playing the settlers."" Pulse and the team wanted to challenge the audience and test how they would view casting not based on skin color or nationality. ""Our major is Black, our pastor is Black, we have white soldiers, we have Black soldiers. So how do you feel when you look at this? Do you see the story or do you see color or race?"" asks Pulse of the audience.
After all, the themes dealt with by both groups represented in the opera— the German settlers and the Herero people — are the same: ""The story in both of these spaces deals with themes of power, jealousy, greed — the fact that women don't have that much control over who they marry, what they say, what they wear,"" explains Pulse. ""So are you seeing those things before you see race?""

Musically speaking, the work fuses classical Western music with African music, and features improvisation — an element lacking in the standard classical canon. This pays homage to Namibia's oral musical tradition.
The libretto is bilingual, in Otjiherero and German. The opera's composer, Eslon Hindundu, wrote in the program notes that this was was done to ""bring two nations together in harmony,"" as well as to ""open the minds and eyes of Namibians"" and ""reflect on the journey that Namibians have taken for today's current and future generations.""
Indeed, one of the opera's goals is to unite Namibians through music. The team, including Pulse who is from Namibia and German director Kim Mira Meyer, traveled the country selecting props such as woven baskets and clothing items which are used in various regions of the country — and not only by one ethnic group.
Having the European premiere of ""Chief Hijangua"" in Berlin is packed with significance for Pulse: ""Our history has been connecting us from the day that we met and it will still continue connecting us, until the the day history evolves into something else. And that's why we brought it here.""

https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-morocco-earthquake-not-caused-by-laser-weapon/a-66799897,SCIENCE,Fact check: Morocco earthquake not caused by 'laser weapon' 13.09.2023,"While the search for missing persons after the devastating earthquake in Morocco continues and the cleanup has just begun, videos have gone viral on social media allegedly showing strange events related to the earthquake. 
Claim: ""This happened before the earthquake in Morocco,"" claims a user on X, formerly Twitter. He posted a video that purports to show ""some kind of drone"" throwing lightning bolts and ""a huge laser-like beam"" downward. Another video, which has been viewed more than 200,000 times, purports to show the sky over Marrakech ""before the earthquake occurred."" The videos are also being spread on TikTok.  
DW fact check: Fake.
The videos have nothing to do with the earthquake in Morocco and therefore cannot prove the theory of a ""laser weapon"" being used to start the earthquake. The videos are demonstrably older and in parts not genuine at all. 
This video, which is supposed to show a lightning bolt, has been posted several times and can be traced back to 2020, long before the recent earthquake in Morocco. Many users and also the author himself commented ironically on the video, which is supposed to show an attack by aliens. It was created by a video artist called Jay Hideaway, who uses VFX technology to insert artificially created visual effects into real videos. His TikTok channel features numerous computer-generated videos that are supposed to show apocalyptic scenes, such as zombie attacks or an explosion of the moon. On his account, Jay Hideaway calls his works ""apocalyptic video art.""
The second video, supposedly showing the sky over Marrakech shortly before the earthquake, is also not evidence of strange activity in the air in connection with the disaster. Using a reverse image search, we come across discussions about Unknown Flying Objects (UFOs) in forum posts. The oldest post, on Reddit, which contains the said video in the thumbnail, dates from November 2021, according to Google, and is thus just under two years old.
This is not the first time that the use of mysterious weapons has been the alleged cause of natural disasters. After the Hawaii wildfire disaster in August, images circulated on the web purporting to show an attack using energy weapons on the island of Maui. The alleged evidence image does not show futuristic directed energy weapons (DEW), but a missile launch from 2018, as our fact check shows. 
Videos of alleged evidence of human intervention also made the rounds after the devastating earthquake in Turkey in February. Lights in the sky were said to prove that the earthquake in Turkey was allegedly caused by a former US military program called the High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP). So-called earthquake lights were probably the cause of the flashes in the videos, fact checks showed. Earthquake lights are generated by sparks on power lines when they are interrupted by the tremors of the earthquake.
That natural disasters in particular are always a breeding ground for obscure suspicions and conspiracy theories is no coincidence, experts said.
""Times of crisis are always a heyday for disinformation, misinformation and conspiracy myths,"" Lena Frischlich, a media psychologist at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich and an expert on conspiracy theories, told DW. ""That simply has to do with the fact that the information situation itself is very uncertain.""

https://www.dw.com/en/moroccos-deadly-earthquake-destroys-cultural-sites/a-66797784,CULTURE,Morocco's deadly earthquake destroys cultural sites 13.09.2023,"In addition to the rising death toll and the thousands of people injured by the powerful earthquake that hit Morocco on Friday, several cultural landmarks have also been destroyed.
Morocco is home to nine UNESCO World Heritage sites, and the United Nations' cultural organization is making its first cautious assessments of the extent of the damage, though information is still incomplete.
According to UNESCO, several of the country's World Heritage sites have been severely damaged, including parts of the almost 1,000-year-old Medina in Marrakech. The Old City has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985.
The city's most important landmark, the 12th-century Kutubiyya Mosque, has also been badly damaged.
The minaret of the Kharbouch Mosque in Marrakech's Jemaa el-Fnaa Square has collapsed. The Mellah of Marrakech, or Jewish quarter, is in ruins. The city's famous historic red sandstone city wall has numerous cracks, and parts of it have crumbled.
The city, which draws many tourists, quickly undertook clean-up work after the quake, and the first cafes have already reopened. But the situation looks much worse outside the urban center.
The earthquake's epicenter was in Al Haouz province in the High Atlas Mountains, where entire villages were devastated with high numbers of victims.
""After a disaster like this, the most important thing is to preserve human lives,"" Eric Falt, regional director of UNESCO's Office for the Maghreb, told The Art Newspaper. However, Falt also emphasized the importance of assessing the damage and restoring tangible and intangible cultural heritage sites.
Of course, after a disaster, there are more immediate needs to be met — can people still be saved; is there enough food and drinking water; do people have access to safe shelter? But in a second phase, schools and cultural assets will need to be rebuilt, and plans need to begin as soon as possible, the UNESCO regional director added.
Photos on X, formerly Twitter, show numerous ""before and after"" pictures of buildings that were destroyed, including the mosque of Tinmal in the Atlas Mountains, one of the most important historical buildings in the country.
""It is a symbolic place in the history of Morocco,"" said Falt. Its destruction represents an inestimable loss to Morocco's national heritage. The Tinmal Mosque was a contender to be listed as another World Heritage Site in Morocco.
Cultural monuments are important not only for tourists and historians but also for the local people affected by the disaster, explained Susann Harder, president of the international cultural property protection organization Blue Shield.
""People have cultural rights,"" she told DW. ""It is important for them to be able to perform their ritual practices at funerals, and to find prayer rooms beyond the destroyed historic mosques, especially at this time.""
Rituals and religious holidays strengthening the sense of community can provide stability in difficult times, she added.
Cultural institutions are, therefore, extremely important for people who have just lost everything, the World Heritage expert explained.
In Morocco, it is primarily the old towns listed as World Heritage sites, such as the Medina of Marrakech. When such areas are destroyed, people lose part of their cultural identity.
""Such sites are not only important for tourism. Above all, they are living spaces,"" Harder said. The structures that make up cultural heritage sites have been developed over centuries and have been part of the people's everyday life as it's where they live, shop, pray and work, she added.
When natural disasters or wars damage such sites, people not only lose an important anchor but also part of their cultural memory. That's also how a Marrakech resident summarized it for Morocco's The National newspaper: ""It's a shock. Our identity is defined by these sites.""

https://www.dw.com/en/francis-kere-pioneer-of-social-architecture/a-66790200,CULTURE,Francis Kere: Pioneer of social architecture 12.09.2023,"His home village in Burkina Faso had neither electricity nor running water. But Diebedo Francis Kere's father wanted to offer his eldest son a better future. He was the only of 13 siblings to be sent to school, at the age of 7.
That privilege, however, meant that he had to leave his village. Far from his family, he sat with more than 100 children in a dark and stuffy classroom that frequently overheated.
That's when he started dreaming that he would one day build better schools with natural light and better air circulation.
Today, Francis Kere is one of the world's elite architects and a leading voice in sustainable design.
In 2022, he became the first Black architect, and the first one from the African continent, to receive the prestigious Pritzker Prize — an award seen as the ""Nobel Prize"" of architecture.
On September 12, the Japan Art Association honored him with the Praemium Imperiale for his life's work.
Francis Kere, who was born in the small village of Gando in 1965, moved to Berlin as a young man thanks to a scholarship.
He first completed vocational training as a carpenter in the German capital before starting to study architecture at Berlin's Technical University in 1995.
While still a student, he completed his first major project, building a primary school out of clay in Gando — light and airy, just like the one he wished for as a child.
For his respectful use of resources and his environmental approach, he received the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2004, the first of many honors.
He almost didn't return to university, but his professors convinced him to complete his studies.
In 2005, he founded his own office in Berlin, Kere Architecture.
He now has both German and Burkinabe citizenship. His internationally acclaimed projects include the ""Opera Village Africa"" initiated by the late German theater and film director Christoph Schlingensief.
With the construction of the elementary school in Gando, Kere demonstrated how the oldest but also most ecological building material in the world can be used in a more modern and resistant way.
Kere's bricks are made of clay, which has been used in the Sahel region for centuries due to its temperature-regulating properties,. He also makes use of laterite, a soil type that has a rusty-red coloration due to its high iron oxide content. A little bit of cement is added to the slightly moistened earth that is pressed into bricks, which makes them strong and waterproof.
The building's design is so clever that it does not need air conditioning to remain cool, working with natural air circulation instead. Kere also designs his buildings in harmony with the path of the sun, integrating natural shade into his concepts.
""For a better future for all of us — not just in Africa, but for all of us on this planet — it is important to go back and actually only use materials that nature freely gives us and to stop over-exploiting them,"" Kere told DW while working on one of his latest projects in Senegal, the Goethe Institute in Dakar.
Dealing with the extreme temperatures is one of Kere's key concerns. The roof of his building in Dakar is literally its crowning glory. 
""Like the crown of a tree, this structure provides shade and protection. Here you can meet or simply relax,"" he said at the presentation of the building project.
Whether in Dakar or in Benin, where he is currently building the new parliament building, Kere's approach follows traditional rules and is based on a holistic concept, largely involving local workers.
""Building is a big task and it requires many, many people to work together; people who also have a lot of experience and pass on their knowledge to the next generation,"" said the architect. ""That means it's a community event, and I've integrated that idea into my projects.""
Remaining true to his first design, the village school in Gando, Kere is committed to architectural designs filled with air and light which harness the local community's energy and convey identity and pride. ""Of course I want to create quality and comfort. But above all, I want the result to inspire people,"" he said.
This is also the case in his current project, the Parliament of the Republic of Benin, which incorporates the traditional African ""palaver tree"" — which refers to the African custom of regularly meeting to build social ties and settle disputes without violence at a set location, often a tree. It stands for democratic values and cultural awareness.
The Praemium Imperiale is one of the most important arts prizes in the world.
The prestigious global arts award is given every year in five different fields — along with Kere's prize in architecture, this year's winners are Vija Celmins in painting, Olafur Eliasson in sculpture, Wynton Marsalis in music and Robert Wilson in theater/film.
Each prize is endowed with 15 million yen (€95,000/$102,000).
The Praemium Imperiale has been awarded annually since 1989 by the Japan Art Association. The Japanese imperial family created it to commemorate Prince Takamatsu, who died in 1987.
The award ceremony will take place in October in Tokyo.
Previous winners of the Praemium Imperiale include architects such as Norman Foster and Rem Koolhaas, director Martin Scorsese, photographer Cindy Sherman and German painter Georg Baselitz.
As a young boy in Burkina Faso, Francis Kéré dreamed of one day becoming an architect. And he has fulfilled his dream: Today, he is internationally one of the most sought-after in his field. His designs use natural materials, and he focuses on sustainability and social interaction.

https://www.dw.com/en/gabriel-boric-chiles-democracy-still-under-construction/a-66774928,POLITICS,Gabriel Boric: Chile's democracy 'still under construction' 11.09.2023,"""For me, politics is not a game of arithmetic,"" Chilean President Gabriel Boric told DW. ""I believe that democracy, to be strengthened and to take care of itself, has to know how to respond … to the needs of our citizens.""

Boric, Chile’s president since March 2022, is the country’s eighth elected leader since Augusto Pinochet’s military rule ended in 1990. The 37-year-old was born more than a decade after Pinochet’s violent coup ousted the Marxist president, Salvador Allende, on September 11, 1973, but like many Chileans he too has had to grapple with its aftermath.
In an exclusive interview with DW's Jenny Perez to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1973 coup, Boric spoke of the current role of the armed forces, the challenges faced by his government and the changes he himself has undergone since he was elected.
""Taking office as president of Chile means you have to adapt when it comes to certain things. You are ruling over an entire country, and, therefore, you represent the whole of Chilean society, those who voted for you and those who didn't,"" said Boric, who is also the leader of Chile’s left-wing Social Convergence Party.
""But my longing for social justice, for social transformation, for progress toward a fairer distribution of wealth, toward a total end to discrimination against women and sexual diversity, toward a development that is just and integral, remains intact,"" he said, adding that he remained ""a person with left-wing convictions.""
These political positions, and the fact that Boric is Chile's most progressive head of state in the past 50 years, have influenced the commemorative events around the anniversary of the coup and Allende's death on September 11, 1973.
Boric said that given the chance he would thank the president [Allende] for his commitment, courage and sacrifice.
""I would tell him that we are working hard to follow in his footsteps, hoping 'to continue opening great avenues again, where free men and women can walk together to build a better society,'""
Boric said citing from the last speech Allende ever made on the day he died.
It remains unclear to this day whether Allende's death was suicide or murder.
The repercussions of Pinochet's dictatorship still divide much of Chilean society. Boric had campaigned for a bigger event marking the anniversary of the 1973 coup, but according to a survey by pollster Pulso Ciudadano at least 60% of Chileans were not interested. 
A ""Pact for Peace,"" an effort introduced by Boric's predecessor to resolve the social and political conflict that has triggered countrywide protests since 2019, was also divisive. During his presidency, Boric has attempted to improve coexistence through minimum agreements of democratic respect, including the rewriting of the constitution, but the country's right-wing and center-right parties have not supported his efforts. He has championed the idea of a ""Pact for Democracy.""
""We continue to have differences as to why this institutional breakdown is taking place, and I see with concern that there are many right-wing leaders who insist on the idea that without Allende, there would have been no Pinochet,"" said Boric. ""When you think about what that means, it is very worrying. It means that should there be another constitutional government they do not like and a climate of polarization and political difficulties, then the answer is a coup d'etat and a dictatorship.
""I hope Chilean society agrees with me when I say that we will always solve the problems of democracy with more democracy and not less. And that nothing will ever justify violating the human rights of those who think differently,"" he said.
Boric believes it's a positive development that all of Chile's living ex-presidents, including the center-right Sebastian Pinera, have signed the Pact for Democracy.
When asked about Chilean society taking a possible ultraconservative turn and the increase in more radical visions from all sectors, Boric told DW he was worried. He stressed the need for the government to respond to the ""needs of our citizens.""
""In Chile, we have been waiting 10 years for a pension reform. Not only do pensions not go up, but the trust Chileans have in democracy as a mechanism for solving their problems is weakened,"" he said.
""Democracy, from my point of view, is an end in itself, and we have to be looking after it constantly, watering it, caring for it,"" he said, adding that it was ""based on consensus.""
""The art of politics, the art of fair policies, is to reach agreements among those who think differently for the sake of a shared common good. And when societies become polarized, that shared common good can seem distant.""
However, Boric said he did not believe there was a danger of the events of September 1973 being repeated in Chile: ""It would be irresponsible of me to say so,"" he pointed out.
He also highlighted recent policy achievements, such as mining royalties or reducing the work week to 40 hours, as examples of how Chilean democracy can function.
""I believe that the opposition is playing a role, which has indeed resulted in a blockage to certain reforms, but it is part of how democracy works, and it is up to us to seek and explore new ways of reaching agreements,"" he said.
And the role of the military? ""Now, I am certain that the armed forces are not looking to engage in any kind of adventure and that they are steadfast constitutionalists and respectful of the constitution and the rule of law,"" Boric stated.
The Chilean president's confidence lies in the strength of the country's institutions but he recognizes that maintaining democracy is an ongoing process.
""Chilean democracy is a democracy that is still under construction. I would not say that there is a moment when democracies are fully consolidated because societies change, and with change comes new challenges,"" he said.
""The inclusion of the feminist movement in our society, for example, has been very organic given the way politics was understood until 10 years ago. The old idea of infinite development at any cost is not only being questioned today. It is seen as something that could endanger the very survival of humanity. So democracies are constantly perfecting themselves.""
Referring to the fact that the Chilean dictatorship came about in the context of the Cold War, which led to numerous military regimes in the region, Boric pointed out that ""the power of arms is very meager. It vanishes with time. Bodies can disappear, people can be murdered, comrades can be tortured, but the dignity of those who fell and those who fight for a free country always ends up prevailing.
""And this is valid for the history of Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and so many other Latin American dictatorships — or the world,"" he warned.
Since his presidency began in 2022, Boric has also stood out on the international stage for his condemnation of leftist dictatorships in the region. In this regard, the president said he wasn't afraid of criticism.
""I am convinced that, in terms of human rights, we must have a single standard, both from the historical point of view and from a whole of society point of view, and therefore, we cannot go around choosing which autocracies we like and which we don't like,"" he said.
""If we value and defend democracy and, in particular, the universal respect for human rights as an advance of humanity, we have to defend it from the left, center, and right, whether we are red or blue. And I will stay firm on this no matter who it bothers.""
Boric also spoke in favor of the recent gesture by the United States to declassify documents outlining the role of the world power in the 1973 coup.
""The US ambassador to Chile has been very open to it. Some documents have already been declassified, and I believe that the position of the United States today is clear when it comes to condemning what happened,"" he said.
""However, we can always do more. The Nixon administration at the time made every possible effort — and this is all documented — first, to prevent President Allende from taking office and then to hinder and create the conditions of chaos that allowed for the coup.""
US President Richard Nixon's administration was heavily involved in the events leading up to the coup in Chile, with the CIA helping to finance opposition efforts to organize strikes by truck drivers and shop owners. The US also backed Pinochet's government despite his regime's human rights record.
Boric said that he would ask for information on the alleged collaboration of the West German intelligence service with the Pinochet dictatorship and the German sect Colonia Dignidad, which cooperated with the regime.
""I have talked about this with Chancellor [Olaf] Scholz the few times I have met him. From what I have seen, I think he is keen to collaborate in everything related to the investigation and recognition of what happened in Colonia Dignidad,"" said Boric.
There has been an agreement to install plaques in memory of the victims of the German sect, although there have been no significant advances on that front. Boric said that ""just a bit of willpower"" is needed for that.
""What is clear to us is that there are still many dark elements around, even 50 years after the breakdown of democracy in Chile. Therefore, we will continue to fight for truth and justice.""

https://www.dw.com/en/saudi-arabia-will-football-stars-have-a-political-impact/a-66728542,POLITICS,Saudi Arabia: Will football stars have a political impact? 10.09.2023,"Last week, German professional footballer Toni Kroos told journalists that Saudi Arabia was ruining the game of soccer.
The former German national player was not alone in this complaint. Sports commentators and fans alike have criticized the fact that Saudi Arabia has recently been enticing some of the world's most famous football players to its domestic league with extravagant multi-million dollar salaries.
Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo, Brazil's Neymar, French striker Karim Benzema, Sadio Mane of Senegal and a number of others have all taken up contracts with teams in the Saudi football league. It is estimated their various deals might top $1 billion (€926 million) in salaries for around 20 international players.
""In the end, it's a decision about money — and against football,"" Kroos said of the players who had left for Saudi Arabia, during an August interview with the German edition of Sports Illustrated magazine. ""And from that point, it starts to get difficult for the football we all know and love.""
But could football also make life for Saudi Arabia's autocratic government more difficult? After all, the increased international scrutiny that comes with such high profile players also means more attention on the way Saudi Arabia is ruled as a monarchy, as well as its dire human rights record. Kroos himself said he wouldn't go to the Saudi league because of the human rights situation there.
Saudi Arabia's concerted campaign to play a much bigger role in international football is part of the oil-rich Gulf state's ambitious Vision 2030 plan. This aims to diversify the country's economy away from oil income and into sectors like tourism and entertainment.
Through various financial vehicles and sponsorships, the Saudis have also invested huge amounts in everything from golf, cricket, cycling, Formula One, tennis, wrestling and most recently, mixed martial arts.
Football wasn't always on the agenda. As James Dorsey, an expert on football in the Middle East, has noted, the first consultants to work on Saudi Arabia's national sports strategy were told to focus on individual sports — like tennis or golf — rather than team sports.
""De-emphasizing team sports was intended to limit soccer's potential as a venue for anti-government protests,"" Dorsey, a senior fellow at the Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and the author of the syndicated newsletter, ""The Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer"" wrote in an August column.
There are plenty of historical examples of how football can be politically troublesome in the region.
In 1958, during the Algerian campaign for independence from colonial power, France, some of the best Algerian players caused controversy by defecting from the French football league to form their own, independent national team.
In 2000, Libyan football fans stormed the pitch in Benghazi after an unfair game against a club owned by the son of dictator Moammar Gadhafi.
In 2011, hard core football fans in Egypt known as ""ultras"" played a significant role in the revolution that eventually toppled the country's long-standing dictator, Hosni Mubarak. And most recently, Qatar changed its own labor laws after international criticism before and during the 2022 football World Cup, which it hosted.
Despite such examples, the advisory to steer clear of team sports seems to have been ditched after 2018, when Saudi Arabia's ambitious Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman cemented his hold on power.
The Saudi government now says its focus on football is about economic diversification, locals' health — over 60% of Saudi nationals are obese or overweight — and developing sporting infrastructure. Human rights activists disagree, arguing it's about ""sportswashing,"" the practice of using sports events as a way of distracting from such things as a country's repressive politics.
The answer most likely lies somewhere in the middle: The Saudi sports strategy is motivated by both internal and external political considerations.
Around two-thirds of the Saudi population is under 35 and football is the country's favorite sport. ""So I think that he [Mohammed bin Salman] realized you can't really build a sports sector without football,"" Dorsey suggested. ""He has to deliver on jobs and economic sustainability and sports is part of that. There are also non-economic factors,"" he continued.
""To reduce the risk of challenges … most autocrats rely on a combination of repression, legitimation and co-optation,"" the authors of a 2022 paper, International Sports Events and Repression in Autocracies, published in the American Political Science Review, explained.
""So they're using [football] for both legitimacy and, to some degree, co-optation purposes,"" Adam Scharpf, one of the study's authors and an assistant professor of political science at the University of Copenhagen, told DW. 
Having the world' best footballers playing in the country's own league impresses citizens and demonstrates that the country can play as an equal on the world stage, Scharpf said. ""Of course, you also have repression. And this is all combined in a strategic way.""
It's something of a ""bread and circuses"" situation, both Dorsey and Scharpf agreed, referring to the ancient Roman adage that basically says when citizens are entertained and well fed, they won't bother with politics.
""Essentially, what the government is now doing is saying: 'Well, if you want Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, we'll give them to you.'"" Simon Chadwick, a professor at the Skema business school in France, who specializes in the links between sports and politics, told The Athletic, a sports publication, in June. ""But the flip side to that is they do not want to be questioned. So far this year, there have been more arrests of people in Saudi Arabia for posting negative comments about the government than ever before. The contract is that you can have whatever you want, but don't question us.""
After looking in detail at the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, Scharpf and other researchers concluded that autocratic regimes are well aware of the double-edged nature of large sporting events and deliberately devise strategies to deal with those. These may include increased violence before and after an event and increased surveillance. 
""So in many ways, the sports event doesn't make things better for people living in the country, it makes them worse,"" Scharpf said.
In fact, despite all of the optimism about sports being a catalyst for positive social change, football is just a tool, Dorsey argued. Whether or not it brings change depends on circumstances and how political leaders choose to use it.
""In 2011, when football fans played a major role in Egypt, there were several pre-existing conditions,"" he explained. ""You had widespread discontent and the stadium was one of the few places where that discontent could be voiced and where people had a sense of strength and numbers. Are those circumstances theoretically possible in Saudi Arabia? Sure. Is there any indication that's a realistic scenario anytime soon? Absolutely not.""
Of course, football might still play a positive role at a personal or societal level. However when it comes to nationwide politics, neither Scharpf nor Dorsey think football is about to have any impact in Saudi Arabia. In fact, as Scharpf pointed out, he doesn't know of any robust scientific studies anywhere that show sport helps bring about political change at the top.
A brief search using Google offers another, albeit pretty unscientific, answer as to whether the Saudi strategy on football is succeeding at an international level.
A date-restricted search turns up around 10 English-language news headlines about Mohammed al-Ghamdi, the retired Saudi teacher recently sentenced to death for posting political opinions on X (formerly known as Twitter). That's in the week since Human Rights Watch issued a statement on his case.
In that same time frame, there were over 1,000 news headlines featuring the name of British football player, Jordan Henderson, one of the most recent high-profile recruits to the Saudi league.

https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-club-culture-battles-highway-to-hell/a-66753725,MUSIC,Berlin club culture battles 'highway to hell' 09.09.2023,"When the Berlin Wall fell nearly 35 years ago, cultural life soon flourished in the abandoned factories and buildings that were left behind.
Pioneering techno music clubs like Tresor, located in a bombed-out department store vault, and later Berghain — occupying a derelict GDR power station — were some of many that gave life to the remnants of war and division in Berlin. Global creatives, DJs and dreamers soon flooded in to join the party that has become synonymous with the city.
Yet these spontaneous, self-managed cultural venues have long been vulnerable to so-called Clubsterben, or club death, with many already lost to development, gentrification and pandemic restrictions.
More recently, the threat has been heightened by the potential extension of the A100 highway through Berlin. Around 30 clubs and cultural venues that grew up over decades lie in its wake.
The area in question, running north of the Spree River through Friedrichshain in the former East Berlin, has remained relatively free of development. But the 17th and final section of the A100 could flatten the entire precinct.
While Berlin's long-ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD) opposed the extension, the new Christian Democratic Party (CDU) leadership supports it — as does the federal transport minister who has final authority over the project.

Some of Berlin's most celebrated venues face eviction if the A100 goes ahead.
They include the popular riverside dance club, Else, constructed with converted shipping containers; About Blank, an industrial techno club complex run by a collective that once squatted the space; and Wilde Renate, a labyrinthine club and exhibition space located in a former tenement house.
But grassroots campaigning to stop the A100 has reached critical mass in recent months.
Following a similar action in 2022, a classical orchestra and choir blocked the A100 this April under the banner ""Make Music Instead of Concrete"" — and while performing the ACDC song ""Highway to Hell.""
Meanwhile, the Berlin club scene joined forces with climate activists and local citizen initiatives on September 2 to put on a rave for 20,000 people to celebrate cultural life in the district. More than 1,000 attendees came as part of a bicycle demonstration that rode from Berlin's Transport Ministry and aimed to highlight the climate impacts of the highway extension.
The event, titled ""A100 wegbassen,"" which means to get rid of the freeway with loud bass, was partly organized by the Berlin Club Commission, the world's first self-organized network for club culture — and who in 2018 employed a similar theme, ""AfD wegbassen,"" to protest a far-right Aternative for Germany party event in the city via a techno street parade.  
""With lots and lots of people we showed that building another highway is a project of the past. The city of the future focuses on people, not cars,"" said Fridays for Future in an Instagram post after the event.      
One of the impacted clubs, About Blank, said it was willing to stand in the way of the freeway for the sake of both club culture and to stop the climate-changing car traffic that the development will bring.
The collective behind the renowned techno club, founded 13 years ago, said it would help ""create a club-cultural barricade against fossil capitalism, which causes the climate catastrophe.""
""The highway extension is an anachronism, an old burden of the state-protected automobile lobby,"" it added.
Lutz Leichsenring, spokesperson for Club Commission, told DW that Berlin artists and activists had helped stop freeway construction in the 1980s when culturally vibrant tenement streets were due to be flattened in the Kreuzberg district in the former West Berlin.

But while 1950s-era urban planning designed to create car cities is alive and well, Leichsenring believes rapidly rising costs alone could kill the final A100 extension long after the first stage was completed in 1958.
At a cost of €200,000 ($214,000) per meter of construction, the effort to pull down and relocate vast swaths of Berlin may no longer be viable, he believes — especially with costs and permissions not due to be approved until 2027.   
Moreover, the fact that car usage in Berlin has declined by 16% since the introduction of Germany's cheaper €49 monthly public transport ticket means alternatives, including bicycle lanes, are possible to what Leichsenring calls ""a very absurd project.""
Nonetheless, the Club Commission spokesperson fears the lack of certainty could force clubs, theaters and museums to quit the area as they search for long-term security of tenure.
From Klaus Lederer of the Left Party (Die Linke), former Berlin senator for culture, to his current successor, Joe Chialo of the Christain Democratic Party (CDU), Berlin politicians of different political backgrounds have strongly supported Berlin club culture, noted Leichsenring.
This also relates to the growing economic power of the club scene, with a Club Commission study showing that Berlin clubs generated €1.5 billion in revenue for the city in 2018.
When Chialo, a former Green Party member, assumed his role as Berlin's culture czar in 2023, he said he wanted Berlin's clubs to be recognized as ""cultural sites.""
""Clubs are talent factories, make an important cultural contribution; they make inner cities more attractive [and] attract audiences,"" Chialo told Berlin newspaper, the Berliner Zeitung.
This relates to efforts by the Club Commission and others to have Berlin's clubs recognized as part of  UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2021.
""This is important because Berlin's clubs have never been recognized as cultural sites,"" Sophie Kahrmann, DJ and director of Berlin's Anomalie Art Club, told DW during the Rave the Planet street party in 2022. ""Achieving cultural recognition is a way to observe its importance in Berlin and around the world."" 
DW contacted Chialo's office for comment on the potential impact of the A100 on the Berlin club scene but has not had a response. 
Cultural and grassroots activists aim to continue to pressure government by drawing public attention to the issue.
From September 9 to 24, a post-industrial wasteland lying on the route of the next section of the highway will host the action,  ""Spectacle on the Highway"" (Spektakel auf der Autobahn). The two-week program includes live music, circus shows, theater and flea markets and aims to show what would be possible on the vacant site if the freeway wasn't built.
""We want to show with our program what can actually take place here,"" said Konstanz, spokesperson for the collective organizing ""Spectacle on the Highway,"" as hundreds flooded into the catch music and performances on its opening day on Saturday.
Even if the highway was stopped, showcasing the cultural value of the site might also stop it being sold off to the ""highest bidder,"" she said, referring to the new construction projects encroaching on the land by the rail tracks — and flanked by the Wilde Renate nightclub and Zukunft, an outdoor music and cinema venue.
After the current two-week pilot project, the goal is to make the abandoned strip — owned by rail operator, Deutsche Bahn — a permanent cultural space, Konstanz said.
Such an effort to creatively explore the potential of the site is typical of the way club culture emerged in the voids of Berlin. 
""You always have to have space left for future generations,"" said Lutz Leichsenring of cultural life in what has long remained an ""unfinished city.""
""That's a big mistake, to develop everything.""

https://www.dw.com/en/hitlers-bronze-stallions-unveiled-in-berlin/a-66760368,ARTS,Hitler's bronze stallions unveiled in Berlin 09.09.2023,"In 1939,Nazi artist Josef Thorak created the two ""Striding Horses"" (""Schreitende Pferde"" in German) for Adolf Hitler's New Reich Chancellery in Berlin.
Now the controversial three-meter-high and two-ton bronze sculptures are presented together in Berlin again for the first time, on the occasion of Open Monument Day on September 10. 
One of the horses has been on display there for some time, while the second one is now being exhibited for the first time in 77 years following restoration work. 
The showcase is part of the ""Unveiled. Berlin and its monuments"" permanent exhibition at the Spandau Citadel in Berlin, which exhibits other problematic works of art.
The story of the stallions — also named the ""Thorak"" horses after their creator — and their disappearance already fills an entire book.
For a long time it was not clear what had happened to the Nazi sculptures.
It was initially assumed that they had been destroyed during attacks on Berlin towards the end of the Second World War. Later, they were discovered on a Soviet barracks site near Eberswalde, northeast of Berlin.
But they disappeared from there when the Berlin Wallfell in 1989.
It wasn't until 2013 that the Berlin police received a photo that gave reason to suspect the horses might still exist. Along with the photograph was a tip-off that the horses were being offered on the secret art market for an amount in the millions.
That was the starting signal for Rene Allonge, an inspector at the Berlin State Criminal Police Office who specializes in art crime, to join forces with Dutchman Arthur Brand, perhaps Europe's most famous private art detective, to investigate.

The duo were able to clarify that the horse sculptures being offered on the black market were the authentic Nazi bronzes.
""It was clear to me that if we got the horses back, it would be the best story of my life,"" Brand told DW.
The story also involved Stasi agents — East Germany's secret police — and the Soviet occupation forces. The horses were smuggled in pieces across what was then still a border between two occupied zones, presumably to be traded in the West for hard currency.
Then in 2015, a nationwide raid resulted in the horses being seized from an art collector in Bad Dürkheim, near the city of Mannheim in southwestern Germany. It was never clarified whether he had obtained them illegally, and investigations were dropped when the statute of limitations lapsed.
After a years-long legal battle, the collector was finally willing to hand over the horses in 2022.
Brand published a book about the art crime. The case has all the elements of a thriller, he says, including its secrecy, Nazi sympathizers and the raid. No wonder Hollywood has already secured the film rights to the material.
The horses once stood just a few kilometers away from their current location in the citadel, in the garden of Adolf Hitler's New Reich Chancellery. The dictator's idea was that the sculptures would decorate the ""world capital Germania"" he was planning.
Describing the ways the sculptures convey Nazi ideology, Urte Evert, head of the City History Museum of the Spandau Citadel, points out that the stallions embody a certain idea of masculinity.
""The neck is extremely large and powerful, the muscles are completely exaggerated. The whole thing radiates a certain violence,"" the historian says.
Like Arno Breker (1900-1991), Josef Thorak was one of the most important propaganda artists of the Nazi regime and made the horses for Adolf Hitler in the 1930s.










There is another horse, but it was not given to Hitler. Today it stands on the site of a high school on Lake Chiemsee in Bavaria, having apparently landed there in the 1960s when the Thorak family used the sculpture to pay for a son's school fees.
While both horses are now on show at the Citadel Spandau, only one of them will be part of the permanent ""Unveiled"" exhibition, and another one will be kept in a display depot.
They stand next to other statues and busts that are considered problematic, and each tells its own story.
One stallion is now standing in close proximity to a recently discovered bust of Hitler, found in the summer during construction work in Berlin near the former Nazi Chancellery, and attributed to the artist Josef Limburg (1874-1955).
He is said to have made the work in his studio in the Berlin district of Lichterfelde in 1937. It is not known how the piece ended up on the city center. The nose could have been lost at the end of the Second World War, when many portraits of Hitler were destroyed.
Two marble heads from Arno Breker's studio are also shown in the display depot, as well as a sculpture by Arminius Hasemann (1888-1979).
The story of his ""Crouching N*,"" as the 1925 statue of the stereotypically depicted African woman was originally called, could fill a book of its own, especially its ending: The sculpture was smeared with paint and beheaded in 2020 — presumably in the wake of the global protests following the police's brutal killing of African-American George Floyd, according to museum director Evert.
But even before it was vandalized, it had already been decided that the statue would be removed from Berlin's cityscape.
The works of art in the display depot of the Spandau Citadel can only be viewed during guided tours and special events.

There was plenty of glitz and glamour —  Hollywood strikes non-withstanding, we still got to see Adam Driver, Priscilla Presley, Fanny Ardant and Mads Mikkelsen pose for the paparazzi — as well as protests against government abuse in Iran, Russian aggression in Ukraine, and a pop-up street protest condemning the festival itself, for its decision to pick three movies — Roman Polanski's ""The Palace,"" ""Coup de Chance"" by Woody Allen and Luc Besson's ""Dogman"" — whose directors have all been accused of sexual assault.
That was mostly background noise, however, compared to what was happening in theaters. The real show was up on screen and it was by turns important, fantastic, silly or downright lousy.
Some of the most important films in Venice this year were directed by women.
The first African American female filmmaker to have competition entry at the Biennale, Ava DuVernay turned Isabel Wilkerson's weighty, scholarly book ""Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents,"" about the roots and enduring legacy of racism in American society, into ""Origin,"" a powerful and deeply touching love story.
She does so by linking the history and themes explored in the book — which draw links between theories of race and white supremacy in America to those in Nazi Germany and beyond — to Wilkerson's own story of writing it, in which she faced the tragedy of the sudden loss of her husband, mother and close cousin within a few short months.
Agnieszka Holland's ""The Green Border"" is a wake-up call for all those who have forgotten the horrors on the edge of Europe, brought about by the policies of the supposedly democratic nations within.
The Polish filmmaker dramatizes the plight of migrants from North Africa and the Middle East, who were lured to the Belarusian-Polish border by Belarusian government propaganda promising easy passage into the European Union and instead found themselves pawns in a geopolitical game. When the Polish government cracked down, they were stranded, left to struggle and starve in the swampy, treacherous forests between the two countries.
Members of Poland's far-right government have attacked the movie without having seen it, comparing it to ""Nazi propaganda."" 
Holland is one of European cinema's most unflinching historic witnesses, having explored the legacy of the Holocaust in the Oscar-nominated ""Europa Europa"" (1990) and ""In Darkness"" (2011) and, in ""Mr. Jones"" (2019), that of the Holodomor, the Soviet-imposed famine in Ukraine in the early 1930s. 
Meanwhile, a few established directors were responsible for major flops. 
Polanski's ""The Palace"" was a stinker, a nasty, unfunny class conflict — the set-up is a showdown between the rich and the serving staff at a New Year's Eve celebration in a swanky Swiss hotel. The clash opposing the have nots and the 1% has been done much better, and with many more laughs, by Ruben Ostlund in ""Triangle of Sadness"" or Mark Mylod with ""The Menu."" 
If this is to be the last film by the 90-year-old director of ""Chinatown,"" ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Frantic,"" he's certainly decided to go out on a low.
Michael Mann, one of Hollywood's greatest living directors, who has been shut out of the studio system since his expensive (but quite good) mega-flop ""Blackhat,"" arrived in Venice with ""Ferrari,"" hoping the independently-made film starring Adam Driver as the legendary Italian auto maker Enzo Ferrari would turbo-charge his career.
The racing scenes, with gorgeous 1950s open-top cherry-red Ferraris, are thrilling but the film is a car crash.
Driver plays Enzo as a dour macho who bullies and bribes his way to the top, all while cheating on his ""Italian"" wife (Penelope Cruz speaking in her natural, Spanish, accent) with his ""Italian"" mistress, who, to quote a favorite reviewer, in Shailene Woodley's performance feels about as authentically Italian as Pizza Hut. I hope Italy files suit on the grounds of national defamation.
The silly came in the form of ""Dogman,"" another potential comeback movie from another one-time superstar director.
Luc Besson ruled the 90s action era with films like ""The Fifth Element"" and ""Leon: The Professional."" His own galactic misfire — ""Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets"" — landed him in the Hollywood dog house. Multiple #MeToo allegations kept him there, even though Besson was cleared on one assault charge and denies any wrongdoing. ""Dogman"" is his shot at box office redemption.
The film stars Caleb Landry Jones as an abused boy who finds salvation in dogs and drag shows. Born in what looks like 1930s Alabama, he inexplicably grows up in modern-day New Jersey and, thanks to a Doctor Dolittle-esque ability to communicate with canines, he becomes a Garden State Robin Hood, stealing from the rich and helping the poor with the help of his four-legged shaggy army.
Besson's film feels like three or four movies smashed together — part action thriller, part coming-of-age sexual identity drama, part ""Home Alone"" with dogs — and is a crazy hot mess. I kinda loved it.
Jones is phenomenal. I don't know of any other actor who could transition from a shoot-em-up with Latino gangsters to lip syncing ""La Foule,"" as a drag Edith Piaf. They'll need to create a new category at the Academy Awards to give this Dogman his due.  
But the real standout at the 80th Venice Film festival, the truly fantastic, was Yorgos Lanthimos' ""Poor Things.""
The Greek director was last seen on the Lido with ""The Favourite,"" a period drama that smashed up every convention of the genre only to reassemble the pieces into something much more interesting.
With ""Poor Things,"" the reassembling is literal. Emma Stone plays Bella Baxter, despairing Victorian housewife brought back from suicide and re-animated as a Frankenstein-like creature with the body of a grown woman and the mind of a child. But this Frankenstein monster is horny. And a feminist. Suffice to say her journey out of the patriarchy will be eventful. And hilarious.
Stone's performance is fearless, jaw-droppingly good, and packed with lines that will soon be quoted everywhere. (A personal favorite: ""I just have to go punch that baby""). Put your money down now on Stone for best actress at next year's Oscars.
Don't bet on Harmony Korine's ""Aggro Dr1ft"" taking home much in the coming awards season. His new movie, if the term even really applies to this experimental work — shot entirely with infrared cameras, creating a flat, trippy, video-game aesthetic — is less interested in reinventing cinema than obliterating it.
Korine, whose anti-movie movies ""Gummo,"" ""Trash Humpers"" and ""Spring Breakers"" have earned him cult status among midnight screening fanatics, has done away with things like plot, character or even performance. His actors speak in flat monotones, repeating the same cliched phrases — ""I am the world's greatest assassin,"" ""I'm here for my money"" — and moving like badly animated characters in the cut scene of a first-person shooter, circa 2001. All played to a thumping soundtrack composed by EDM producing legend AraabMuzik.
Korine says he's less interested in ""plot"" than ""vibe"" and hoped his film would push cinema towards a new art form, one that fuses film, music and gaming. ""Aggro Dr1ft"" ain't that. But it is an experience. One those of us lucky to encounter it in Venice this year will not soon forget.

https://www.dw.com/en/indias-g20-summit-turns-delhi-into-a-fortress/a-66749019,POLITICS,India's G20 summit turns Delhi into a fortress 07.09.2023,"As the G20 summit kicks off in New Delhi this weekend, Indian authorities are pulling out all the stops to ensure security.    
The summit will be hosted at the state-of-the-art Bharat Mandapam convention center at Pragati Maidan in central Delhi.
With guests including US President Joe Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and other global leaders, authorities are not taking any chances.  
Approximately 130,000 security personnel will be deployed during the summit, including an 80,000-strong contingent from the Delhi police.  
The G20 summit venue and hotels where the leaders stay will be cordoned off. 
Trained commandos of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police armed with long-range weapons will also be positioned in vantage points.  

Schools, banks, business establishments and all government departments will remain shut as enhanced security measures come into place. Even food and e-commerce delivery companies will not be allowed to operate in areas adjoining the summit's venue. 
Over a thousand flights will encounter disruptions through cancellations or adjustments during this period as authorities intend to keep airspace and terminals free of congestion.
Nearly 300 Delhi-bound trains are also likely to be affected, with passengers asked to deboard ahead of their destinations. 
A slew of restrictive curbs will kick in from midnight Friday to ensure a smooth flow of traffic in the national capital during the event that formally kicks off on Saturday.  
Road closures and diversions have already led to longer travel times than usual for average citizens. 
""No heavy or medium goods vehicles, except those classified as essential or emergency, will be permitted to travel on the expressway towards Delhi,"" said Virender Vij, a deputy commissioner of police. 
Security agencies are preparing for all contingencies as protests have been seen during previous G20 summits in London, Toronto and Hamburg. 
It is for this reason that checking and surveillance have been beefed up at major streets, government buildings and security installations during the summit. 
""The venue site and its surrounding areas will be under gridlock especially in the controlled zone. We have sanitized the area and 100 police control room vans with quick reaction teams will tackle any untoward incidents during the G20 summit,"" a senior security official told DW.  

Ahead of the summit, several dry runs and rehearsals have been conducted to ensure that equipment, fountains, lighting, LED panels and all emergency vehicles function without a snag. 
Key parts of Delhi have already got a facelift as fountains, sculptures and summit logos decorate roundabouts, while lights adorn iconic installations like India Gate and Qutab Minar.  
Huge cutouts and billboards of Prime Minister Narendra Modi have also been installed at traffic intersections. 
According to one estimate, 700,000 plants have been installed along with elaborate floral arrangements put up near the summit venue, hotels and other areas with many visitors.  
Nine government agencies, from civic bodies to departments under the Ministry of Defense, have spent large sums on work ranging from horticulture improvement to G20 branding. 
The capital is not new to hosting large international conferences, and has hosted major summits in the past, including the Non-Aligned Movement and the Commonwealth Heads of Government (CHOGM) summits in 1983, and the India-Africa Forum Summit (IAFS) in 2015. 
However, the G20, which comprises the world's wealthiest industrialized nations and the most important emerging economies, carries a different significance.   
What is more, India has taken over the G20 presidency amid tough times, with the world confronting a raft of geopolitical and economic crises.  
With the climate crisis and the conflict in Ukraine casting a long shadow on the grouping's consensus-building efforts, India is trying to broker tangible multilateral outcomes. 
""All permanent members of the UN Security Council are there, and so are all G7 members. India is keen to put its best foot forward and wants to cement its role as a major global player,"" Anil Wadhwa, a former Indian diplomat, told DW. 
In an interview to a news agency ahead of the summit, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said New Delhi was hopeful on delivering a consensus-based G20 statement. 
""We are India. We know how to handle the world. Believe me, especially in the last ten years, we have shown how we can handle the world,"" Jaishankar told news agency ANI. 
Despite the absence of Russian President Valdimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the summit is important for Modi ahead of the 2024 general election as he will be keen to showcase himself as a strong world leader.

https://www.dw.com/en/chinese-carmakers-flex-muscles-at-germanys-iaa-auto-show/a-66727872,BUSINESS,Chinese carmakers flex muscles at Germany's IAA auto show 05.09.2023,"Corporate attendance at this year's IAA in Munich has surpassed last year's, with 750 companies from 38 countries showcasing their latest mobility products.
After rebranding the IAA as a mobility show two years ago, the automobile is no longer the focus of the trade fair. The design of the IAA also looks different. So-called Open Spaces are scattered around the city center to bring visitors and exhibitors closer together.
But of course, it's the latest car models from home and abroad that will primarily lure the expected 700,000 visitors to the auto show, no matter how inviting a newly laid bicycle path in Munich's English Garden might be for the few cyclists who may want to try out the latest two-wheelers also on display at the IAA.
The industry fair, which opened Tuesday with a speech from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, comes as dark clouds engulf the automotive sector in Europe, particularly in Germany. While suffocating pandemic-era supply chain problems have eased, European auto giants are struggling to cope with increased energy costs following Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year.
Although sales in the European Union have steadily improved over the last 12 months, they remain around 20% below their pre-COVID levels as inflation and higher interest rates dampen appetite for new vehicles. At the same time, European manufacturers are facing increasingly stiff competition from Chinese carmakers, which are touting their vehicles at far lower prices.
German mass market manufacturer Volkswagen (VW), which used to occupy entire halls with its models in the past, has restricted its showroom space to just about 1,500 square meters (16,145 square feet) this year.
Even though the exhibition space of VW's Chinese rival BYD isn't much bigger, the Chinese firm and its compatriots will have much better cars to show for, industry analysts agree. In its home market, BYD exceeded VW's sales last year, taking the crown of market leader from the German company.
BYD broke the German dominance, especially with its battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) that, plentifully subsidised by the government, slowly but steadily won over Chinese customers and boosted its market share.
BYD and other Chinese carmakers now want to repeat their success in Europe, where legacy carmakers reigned supreme in the combustion engine era but lag far behind in the race for EV dominance. US electric-car pioneer Tesla was the first to get a foot in the door to Europe. The Chinese are now threatening to break the gates open.
BYD, which stands for Build Your Dreams, is ostentatiously showing off its newly won market power by showcasing a range of six new models meant to premier in Europe. They include the Dolphin compact car to be sold at an entry price of below €30,000 ($32,000) – a price hardly any other EV maker is able to match.
BYD backs up its claim for electric vehicle market leader with sales of 1.8 million EVs last year, knocking Tesla off its throne not only in China but also globally.
BYD's Europe chief, Michael Shu, told reporters in Munich that BYD plans to sell 2.5 million EVs this year. Europe is set to become a major market for the company which has a presence in 15 countries on the continent, including 17 showrooms in Germany.
In Munich, Shu stunned auto analysts by announcing a price tag of less than €45,000 for its SEAL compact executive fastback sedan, a price that may cause VW executives to break out in sweat.
Still VW sells more EVs in Germany than BYD or any other carmaker. But BYD has launched a price war in Europe that is challenging, if not threatening, legacy carmakers.

VW countered the Chinese offensive by announcing that it will launch its own models in two years, with entry-level prices starting at €25,000. Asked if he was worried about the new competitors, VW CEO Oliver Blume told reporters that ""fear is a false advisor,"" and added that VW was focusing on its strengths and would counter the Chinese with confidence.
""I think we have huge opportunities. We have great experience, we know how to build cars,"" said Blume.
BYD has a technological edge over German carmakers, as it's building more efficient batteries, without cobalt and nickel, at lower prices. VW has to rely on numerous cooperative ventures to source its batteries. The Germans are also lagging behind when its comes to state-of-the-art automotive software.
In all, 41% of exhibitors at the auto show have their headquarters in China. Contrary to the Asian onslaught, participation from other European automakers is underwhelming. Philipp Kemmler, head of European communications for Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor, told DW that Chinese carmakers tend to believe that ""if you can make it in Germany, you can make it anywhere.""
Another auto expert, Stefan Bratzel from the Center of Automotive Management (CAM) in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany, thinks the Chinese will have a ""big impact"" on the European auto market in the coming years.
As carmakers roll out their latest offerings, climate groups have vowed protests at the fair, including ""civil disobedience"" aimed at disrupting the IAA. The last edition of the show in 2021 was also troubled by small-scale protests.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-tourist-damages-florence-fountain-for-a-photo/a-66722759,CULTURE,German tourist damages Florence fountain for a photo 05.09.2023,"A German tourist has damaged the famous Fountain of Neptune in Florence after he climbed it to take a photo this weekend, Italian officials said.
The 22-year-old man broke off a piece of marble when he climbed on the monument's chariot, also damaging the horse's hoof on his way back down.
He caused around €5,000 ($5,400) of material damage and now faces a heavy fine.
Florence Mayor Dario Nardella posted footage of the incident on social media and the photo the tourist took.
""There is no justification for ignorance and vandalism towards cultural heritage,"" the mayor wrote on Monday.
Tommaso Muccini, fine arts architect at the Palazzo Vecchio, said the 16th-century statue had been completely restored in 2018.
Muccini told Florence newspaper La Nazione that security cameras protect the fountain, but they only sounded an alarm as the ""imbecile"" tourist jumped down from the statue.
He said the damage would be repaired during scheduled maintenance in October.
The incident comes after several tourists were caught vandalizing historical attractions in Italy this summer, including a German teen who defaced the brickwork of the Colosseum in Rome.

https://www.dw.com/en/a-safe-space-for-pakistani-artists-tackling-taboo-topics/a-66669076,ARTS,A safe space for Pakistani artists tackling taboo topics 04.09.2023,"Historically, art in Pakistan has found unique ways to comment on social issues and push boundaries. However, much like in other countries, the art market is heavily curated, and often the domain of the country's privileged elite is skewed toward certain themes, styles, aesthetics, and formal training.
The Pakistan Art Forum (PAF), established in 2014, aims to circumvent the traditional gatekeepers of art in the country.
It first used social media and digital platforms to feature more eclectic and inclusive artists and styles. After the pandemic, the forum also set up a physical address that serves as a safe space for artists, allowing them to push boundaries and start a dialogue about queer and LGBTQ identity politics, sexuality and power, all while challenging patriarchy — themes that are taboo in Pakistan.
""Throughout the ages, art has been a medium of reform, resistance, used to highlight various social dilemmas,"" Imtisal Zafar, founder of PAF, tells DW. ""It is important for us to not only curate shows that are aesthetically appealing, but also to use art as a medium to shed light on various issues."" 
Human rights violations and atrocities against women in Pakistan have gained more visibility through social media and reports, and the situation is being increasingly denounced by artists challenging the country's patriarchal social system. Many of them have adopted a decidedly feminist stance.
Most notably, Shehzil Malik has gained international renown for her depictions of powerful Pakistani women and femininity. Her works deal with the everyday and structural misogyny faced by women.
While Malik's portrayals of feminine strength are almost otherworldly, fantastical and supernatural, Zainab Aziz is a young emerging artist showing feminine strength in another creative way by focusing on the mundane.
Aziz works primarily with oil paints and has a signature style featuring a monochromatic palette and large voids in her representations. Through black-and-white contrasts, she aims to highlight social hypocrisy.
""My work revolves around female protagonists, the way they share their secrets and bond. I consider the female body as a landscape of a society which bears multiple stories within it,"" says Aziz.
Three pieces from her second solo show, ""Misty Tales of Women,"" document everyday, habitual moments of women's lives, depicting how they are expected to trust their surroundings and what society demands of them blindly.
Aziz, who has received training from Pakistan's College of Art & Design and the National College of Arts, recognizes that the institutions have allowed her to polish her artistry. Still, she laments the lack of connections for young and emerging artists to break through.
""I have faced a lot of difficulties as a Pakistani artist, as we don't get the exposure we deserve, domestically or internationally. One has to struggle by themselves to make their name in the art world,"" says Aziz.
She points out that the Pakistan Art Forum is the only platform in the country that supports emerging and young talents. According to Aziz, PAF's unique proposition is that they help relatively new artists sell their work immediately by encouraging, supporting and guiding them to showcase their work in galleries and helping them get media exposure. 
The founder of PAF, Imtisal Zafar, explains that his mission is to support artists with a diverse portfolio. He routinely visits university art shows of graduating students to discover new talent. He first met Aziz at her thesis show in 2017.
Same-sex sexual acts are banned by Pakistani law. Sodomy is a crime that can be punished with two years to a life sentence in prison.
Understandably, many LGBTQ people in the country lead double lives and engage in clandestine affairs, keeping their sexual identity a secret from their closest friends and family.
Ahmer Farooq boldly tackles LGBTQ issues in his art, shedding light on how gays are pressured into forced heterosexual marriages to uphold a façade of ""normalcy."" 
He explains that a gallery refused to show his work under his concept, which described how the art deals with gay forced marriages. ""I then changed the statement to edit out 'gay' and was allowed to show it. The same art, the same everything, but I had to realign my concept,"" Farooq tells DW.
He says that the press also often refuses to share his art and cover his shows, fearing backlash or legal consequences, as even openly discussing homosexuality can get one into trouble.
Farooq is grateful that PAF has never censored his art, showcasing his work without prejudice or modifying his concept.
The artist's unique style features vibrant colors to translate the hypocrisy of a sanctimonious society visually: ""It all looks bright and cheerful on the surface, but it is much darker if you look closer,"" Farooq points out.
His recent show, ""A Safe Space,"" has drawn considerable local and international interest, and Farooq will show his work in the US soon.
The artist feels safe spaces are essential to many people's survival, as marginalized people need a ""bubble to be themselves.""
While his show shines a light on the challenges faced by the queer community, Farooq states that his work also comments on how we are all bound together in our humanity and simply want the same things: security, love, peace and empathy.

https://www.dw.com/en/an-israeli-filmmaker-in-berlin-ofir-raul-graizer/a-66665721,FILM,An Israeli filmmaker in Berlin: Ofir Raul Graizer 03.09.2023,"Israeli filmmaker Ofir Raul Graizer moved to Berlin 13 years ago, shortly after he finished his film studies at Sapir College in Sderot, a city in southern Israel which has been since 2001 the target of repeated missile attacks by Palestinian militants, due to its proximity to the Gaza strip. 
Graizer found living in the war zone exhausting for more than one reason: ""Not just from running away from missiles, but also dealing with aspects of nationalism and violence from the Israeli side,"" 
What he discovered in the German capital was completely different: ""Berlin was vibrant, fun, young, fascinating. It was nice to have some kind of calm life, it was a relaxed place. So, I ended up staying.""
Many Israelis are moving to Berlin to find peace — a striking twist of fate, knowing that some 90 years ago, Germany was a life-threatening country for Jews. 
Among his ""very small experiences"" of antisemitism in Germany, Graizer recalls passing by a group of teenagers listening to Nazi music and giving him nasty looks. 
But he rather describes other incidents he experienced, such as the harsh reaction of a law enforcement agent after hearing the Israeli's accent, as being more ""anti-foreigner"" than antisemitic: ""I don't think anyone can look at me and say, 'Oh you're Jewish.' But my accent and appearance are obviously not white German,"" he explains.
For the filmmaker, antisemitism and hatred against foreigners ""exist everywhere in the world,"" and Germany is no exception. But he nevertheless sees the country as being at the forefront in ""promoting human rights, artistic freedom, education and arts. It's good to be a part of it,"" he adds.
""Today, Germany is one of the safest places in the world for Jews,"" says Graizer, laughing lightly. ""I'm saying this with humor, but I feel much safer here as a gay leftist.""
The 42-year-old filmmaker grew up in Ra'anana, an affluent city in central Israel with a considerable modern Orthodox community.
With his father being religious, and his mother secular, Graizer went to a secular school, but was brought up religiously: ""We were kind of strict; we had to eat kosher, and we wouldn't take the car on Shabbat,"" recalls Graizer. ""It created a lot of conflict. I hated it, especially when I was a teenager.""
Graizer came out as gay at the age of 16: ""It was not an easy journey; it took some years. But now my parents accept it. A lot of people become softer when they grow older,"" says the director.
Graizer is best known for his feature debut film, ""The Cakemaker"" (2017), which won the Ecumenical Jury prize following its premiere at the Karlovy Vary film festival, along with seven Ophir Awards — Israel's version of the Oscars — and numerous other prizes in festivals worldwide. It was Israel's official entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars in 2019. 
Still, success did not come easily for Graizer. It took him eight years to make ""The Cakemaker."" After being rejected by 19 film funds, he managed to make the film on a shoestring budget of $90,000 (€82,000).
With the success of his first film, Graizer secured funding for his second film more easily, but this time he was faced with new challenges: ""America"" was shot in 2020, during the early stages of the pandemic.
He struggled to film under lockdowns, and the entire cinema industry was unsettled by the pandemic rules: ""'America' is a film made for the big screen. All the theaters and cinemas were shut down and we didn't even know if we would ever be able to show it,"" recalls the director.
But Graizer kept pushing forward. ""Every movie has its journey. You need thick skin, finding the people who believe in what you do and not to take things personally. ""
""America"" tells the story of an Israeli swim coach who returns from the US to Israel after his father's death. Tragic circumstances lead to a complex relationship with his best friend's fiancée, a florist.
The Israeli, German and Czech co-production premiered at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, and won the best actress award at the Jerusalem Film Festival in 2022.
Graizer's film, which will be released in Germany in 2024, is now being screened at the Israeli film festival Seret International, held in Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne from September 3-11, 2023.
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz compared ""America"" to Pedro Almodovar films, as it features bold colors and a melodramatic plot, though Graizer's work is more restrained and quiet than the Spanish filmmaker's typically exuberant movies.
Other critics have compared Graizer to German filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder: ""It's an honor, but I never say that my work is like this or that; I do things the way I imagine them from my subconscious. I'm influenced not just by drama or melodrama, but also mafia, horror, and espionage films,"" explains the director.
There are many similarities between ""America,"" and ""The Cakemaker,"" which is also a romantic melodrama with a love triangle driven by grief.
In ""The Cakemaker,"" a young gay German baker loses his Israeli lover in a car accident. Shortly after, he travels to Jerusalem and gets a job at a café owned by his lover's widow. A tender relationship develops between the two, until his identity is eventually revealed.
Certain aspects of Graizer's personal life are echoed in his films. For example, his husband, a German the filmmaker met three years after moving to Berlin, is a production designer and florist, and he is the one who designed the lush flower shop and flower arrangements in Graizer's latest film.
Graizer's second passion is cooking. He has worked as a cook in restaurants, as a private chef, and as a cooking instructor in Berlin hot spots such as Goldhahn and Sampson, where he taught participants how to cook Israeli vegetarian dishes.
Through those workshops, he has developed certain observations on the Germans' palate: ""The average German eater likes to try new things, but is scared of tastes that are too strong or too bold,"" he points out. 
""But once you show them how to do it, they fall in love with it,"" he adds. ""A lot of people were shocked to find out how amazing roasted eggplant can be or roasting pine nuts, which brings out all their flavor. Small things that anyone can do in their own kitchen,"" adds the foodie, who has also published a book of recipes and family stories about food, ""Ofirs Küche"" (Ofir's Kitchen), which came out in 2018.
Asked about his most notable culture shock experiences in Germany, the first thing that comes to his mind is also food-related: ""The taste of cucumbers and tomatoes,"" he humorously complains — a deception certainly shared by many Mediterraneans who are used to produce that ripens on the plants. ""But it's getting better,"" he adds.
Otherwise, he notes that he is still troubled by the discrepancies between the clichés about his adoptive country and how things actually work: ""We have this stereotype that in Germany everything is planned and on time, but then it takes 20 years to build an airport and the train never arrives on time.""
Then, perhaps in an attempt to show that German quirks are not the only ones to drive him mad, he quickly adds that many other things drive him ""even more crazy,"" such as, in Israel, sitting in ""a bus across a soldier with an M-16 aimed at your crotch.""
""America"" will be screened on Sunday, September 9 at 6:30 p.m. at Moviemento, Berlin, and 7:30 p.m. in Kino 813 in Cologne.

https://www.dw.com/en/150-years-of-berlins-victory-column-changing-symbolism/a-66623291,CULTURE,150 years of Berlin's Victory Column: Changing symbolism 02.09.2023,"There she stands, gleaming as on the first day: Victoria, the golden goddess of victory, enthroned on the Berlin Victory Column, which German emperor Wilhelm I inaugurated on September 2, 1873, after some eight years of construction. The court architect Heinrich Strack was responsible for the planning and construction of this ""National Monument to the Wars of Unification""; the figure of Victoria with laurel wreath and Prussian eagle on the helmet was created by the sculptor Friedrich Drake.
After the wars against Denmark (1864), Austria (1866) and France (1870), which were called the ""Wars of German Unification,"" Wilhelm I, already King of Prussia since 1861, was proclaimed head of the German Empire in Versailles in 1871.
Wilhelm had already commissioned the construction of the Victory Column after the victory over Denmark in 1864.
The day of its unveiling marked the third anniversary of the French surrender — Sedan Day.
The Battle of Sedan took place during the Franco-Prussian War from September 1-2, 1870, which resulted in the capture of Emperor Napoleon II and his thousands of troops, effectively deciding the war in favor of Prussia.
At the time of its construction, the Victory Column stood about one and a half kilometers (about a mile) away from its current location on Königsplatz, now Platz der Republik.
It was erected on Siegesallee in front of the Raczynski Palace that housed the art collection of the Polish count and diplomat Atanazy Raczynski. The building was designed by the Victory Column architect Heinrich Strack. The palace was ultimately demolished, and, beginning in the mid-1880s, the new Reichstag building was erected and completed in 1894.
The Victory Column stood in the way of the plans of Nazi architect Albert Speer. For the ""World Capital Germania"" envisioned by the National Socialists, a huge congress hall was to be built in its place.
So, in 1939, ""Viktoria"" — who crowns the Victory Column — had to move to her present location at the Grosser Stern in the Tiergarten. There, the column was enlarged by another drum from just under 60 to now around 67 meters (197 to 220 feet).
Gilded cannon barrels that were taken from war booty, relief depictions symbolizing the grandeur and superiority of the Empire, and a goddess of victory that even the Nazis knew how to appropriate: no wonder the demolition of the Victory Column was up for debate after World War II. Polish soldiers, unaware of its significance, later regretted not having blown up the monument. The French occupation forces did request the demolition of the Victory Column, but the Americans and British voted against it, while the Soviet Union abstained.
Berliners quickly disbanded with the historical symbolism of the Victory Column, taking away a bit of the grandeur of the goddess of victory by giving it the nickname ""Goldelse"" (the equivalent of ""Golden Lizzy""), which still persists in the vernacular.
Today, the monument is particularly popular with tourists.
But, that's no wonder, as the platform at a height of 51 meters offers an impressive panoramic view of the city. Along the Strasse des 17. Juni (Boulevard of June 17), one looks toward the Brandenburg Gate, which also showcases an image of Victoria, looking toward the east.
In 1987, German film director Wim Wenders sent Bruno Ganz and Otto Sander as guardian angels into the heaven over Berlin, in the film ""Wings of Desire."" The Victory Column plays a central role, from which actor Bruno Ganz as the angel Damiel looks down on the then still divided city — and wants to throw himself down to become an earthly being.
Once the Berlin Wall collapsed, Wenders followed his film up with a sequel in 1993, ""In weiter Ferne, so nah!"" (""Faraway, So Close!"")
Since the mid-1990s, the ""Goldelse"" has been in the midst of the hustle and bustle once a year: the Love Parade traditionally holds its final rally at the Grosser Stern in the Tiergarten, at the foot of the Victory Column. Its successor, Rave the Planet, and Christopher Street Day pride parade also pass by here. And, Barack Obama drew crowds here for a speech in 2008, shortly before he was elected US president.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-auto-show-chinas-carmakers-to-launch-ev-offensive/a-66687763,BUSINESS,German auto show: China's carmakers to launch EV offensive 01.09.2023,"The idea that the IAA is a show focused strictly on the automobile has been inaccurate for some time now. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic two years ago, the organizers — the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) — completely revamped the former auto show in an attempt to secure the survival of the fair as a ""globally unique mobility platform"" in a new location, namely Munich.
The IAA began in Berlin in 1897 and stayed there for 50 years before moving to Germany's financial hub of Frankfurt am Main.
Now in Munich for the second year in a row, the IAA wants to be seen as a showcase of ""urban mobility,"" exhibiting ""mobility ecosystems,"" and not merely a single mode of transportation, the automobile. The marketing pitch sounds like an excuse for the absence of many foreign automakers in Munich this year— indeed, more bicycle manufacturers are set to attend, whatever that says about the new IAA's appeal.
Quite naturally, the big three of the German automobile industry — Volkswagen (VW), BMW and Mercedes-Benz — have a vested interest in holding the event in their home market. But the list of globally known brands represented in Munich is shorter than ever, with, apart from the German heavyweights, only Renault from France and Stellantis Group's Opel brand.
A handful of exotic newcomers to the electric vehicle market like Lucid from the United States and Croatian electric sports car maker Rimac are also present. Vietnam's Vinfast EV company withdrew its participation at short notice, no reason given.
In the absence of the auto industry's big whales, some of the small fry are looking to create a splash on the European car market. One of them is BYD — initials stand for Build Your Dreams — a Chinese manufacturer based in the industrial hub of Shenzhen.
In China, BYD is an industry whale itself, especially with its battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) that are so successful that BYD last year replaced VW as Chinese market leader by sales. BYD is now building the dream of conquering the European market with its BEVs and plans to showcase six of its models at the IAA.
BYD used to be a manufacturer of smartphone batteries, but is now applying the know-how gathered in its early days to produce state-of-the-art batteries for EVs.
BYD car batteries do not require nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which makes them less expensive to produce. In terms of software and technical innovations, China's EV makers have also made big strides in recent years, and are now on the cutting edge of digital applications for cars.
China-made EVs are still few and far between on German roads — BYD has sold 1,448 cars so far, while VW has delivered 207,000 EVs in Germany. However, experts believe BYD and other Chinese EV makers will be able to win customers in Europe with significantly lower prices for their cars.
There is precedence: In the 1980s and 1990s, carmakers from Japan and South Korea were initially laughed at for their cars, but they then steadily increased their market share through lower prices and better quality.

Despite the shortage of big names at this year's IAA, exhibition halls are 90% booked, according to the VDA industry group. IAA's design concept has been changed and now includes two separate locations — the main exhibition center for professional visitors and a so-called Open Space in downtown Munich for the general public.
BYD said it will showcase its cars at both locations. Perhaps it was this Chinese IAA dominance that made the organizers bend over backward to ensure the presence of the world's most valuable carmaker: Tesla. It is not known, however, why CEO Elon Musk has finally given in to VDA's courting, as Tesla usually prefers to organize its own special events to promote its technology.
Tesla, BYD and the German carmakers are currently locked in a fierce battle for bigger shares of the emerging EV market in Europe. After overcoming supply-chain snarls amid the COVID pandemic, German auto giants are back in expansion mode with surging sales and profits in the second quarter.
Auto experts predict challenging times ahead, however. ""China is well on its way to becoming an automotive superpower,"" said consulting firm AlixPartners in a note to investors recently, and added that the era of record profits for German manufacturers is ""coming to an end.""
Consultants at EY also sense ""strong headwinds"" for legacy manufacturers in their home markets.
As far as the world's biggest car market China is concerned, more than one study predicts domestic manufacturers reigning supreme, with their market share surging to about 65% by 2030.

https://www.dw.com/en/hermitage-amsterdam-cuts-ties-to-russia-and-rebrands-as-hart/a-66686537,ARTS,Hermitage Amsterdam cuts ties to Russia and rebrands as H'ART 01.09.2023,"All visitors to Amsterdam who have taken a canal trip will be familiar with the building: It's a beautiful palace right on the River Amstel, a brick building with a striking white portal that was built in the 17th century as Diaconie Oude Vrouwen Huys, or ""Nursing Home for Old Women.""
In the early 2000s, the building was rededicated as an institution for the arts. With support from the Dutch, a branch of the Saint Petersburg Hermitage, called Hermitage Amsterdam, was established here.
The elaborate renovation, which is said to have cost over €40 million ($43 million), was financed by Russia; officially, a private foundation registered in the United Kingdom at the time was behind the project.
Incidentally, this was not the first attempt by the famous Saint Petersburg museum to establish some sort of permanent representation in the West. There was already a branch in London from 2000 to 2007 and in Las Vegas from 2001 to 2008.
In 2009, Hermitage Amsterdam was officially opened by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and Russia's then interim president, Dmitry Medvedev.
In the following years, more than a dozen lavishly staged exhibitions were held there, filled with pieces from the immense depots of Russia's Hermitage. With more than 3 million items, the museum is one of the largest and richest in the world.
Private treasures of the Russian tsars, antique gold, Persian miniatures and masterpieces by Caspar David Friedrich from the Russian collections were presented in Amsterdam — to name just a few high-profile projects.
Over 700,000 visitors saw the opening show. Numbers then leveled off at around 450,000 visitors per year. This put the museum securely in fifth place in the ranking of art museums in the tourist mecca of Amsterdam, overtaken only by the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh, Stedelijk and Amsterdam museums respectively. Admission costs €10 on average, so the investment certainly paid off even after deducting all incidental costs.
Of course, the business model of a museum empire with exhibitions that move from one branch to another is not new. The Louvre in Paris, for example, operates a successful branch in Abu Dhabi, and the Guggenheim museums are also a globally operating consortium.
On February 24, 2022 — the day Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine — the Hermitage was showing an exhibition of the so-called Russian avant-garde, which had opened shortly before.
Then, on March 3, the exhibition and the museum were closed.
According to Saint Petersburg insiders, the museum's pro-Putin Hermitage director, Mikhail Piotrovsky, convened a crisis meeting at the end of February, complaining among his close staff that he — as the ""museum prince of Russia"" — had not been informed of the plans for the invasion of Ukraine in time.
Amid the turmoil of launching the war on Ukraine, the Hermitage had to retrieve hundreds of invaluable artworks — not just from Amsterdam, but from elsewhere. These included two Titian masterpieces that were on loan in Italy as well as 23 pieces of the traveling exhibition ""Grand Tour. Dream of Italy from Venice to Pompeii.""
The return transport of the famous Mozorov Collection from a Paris exhibition to various Russian museums also proved to be a major logistical and diplomatic problem, especially since some of the works also came from Ukrainian holdings.
While Russia's Hermitage staff was dealing with all of this, the Amsterdam branch was abandoned. But in a show of creative solidarity, the other art houses in Amsterdam came to its aid. Together they developed the idea of a Dutch Heritage museum as a transitional model.
First, the neighboring Rijksmuseum loaned one of its iconic works, Vermeer's ""Milkmaid."" An exhibition on the history of the painting and the Delft painter's craft was arranged around the masterpiece. The exhibition also served as a successful introduction to the Vermeer mega-show in 2023.
Now Hermitage and the H'ART Museum have officially separated. Despite the circumstances, it looks like a clean break. As of September 1, the Amsterdam museum officially bears a new name, the H'ART Museum.
Both sides have engaged in an exchange of pleasantries: The Saint Petersburg Hermitage published an official statement on its homepage praising more than 15 years of joint success. Hermitage Director Piotrovsky regrets the separation imposed by politics and wishes the new project all the best ""in the care of the national cultural heritage.""
Annabelle Birnie, the longtime director of Hermitage Amsterdam, is also quoted as saying that in the past decade and a half ""a brilliant museum has been created"" that inspired millions of people.
In a statement in the Russian press, she also expresses the hope that the bad times may soon be over, so that cooperation with the Saint Petersburg Hermitage can be resumed.
Until then, her house would ""bring art from all over the world to Amsterdam and present it in a new and unexpected way.""
Three top-rate international players have been identified as new partners: the British Museum in London, the Centre Pompidou in Paris, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington.

https://www.dw.com/en/united-states-russia-direct-line/a-66675624,HISTORY,Ukraine war: Is the US-Russia military hotline still in play? 30.08.2023,"In October 1962, the world had already experienced two world wars, and a third appeared imminent.
The communist superpower of the Soviet Union had installed nuclear missiles on the island of Cuba, its ally, just 180 kilometers (112 miles) from the US mainland. America felt threatened and imposed a naval blockade.
After an American plane was shot down, many feared the worst. But at the last moment, the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, announced on Radio Moscow that Soviet nuclear weapons would be withdrawn from Cuba. The world breathed a sigh of relief.
Profound shock at how close they had come to disaster led both sides to think about confidence-building measures despite and indeed because of their enmity. They agreed to set up a direct communications link between the capitals of Washington and Moscow.
The hotline between Washington and Moscow came into operation on August 30, 1963, 10 months after the Cuban Missile Crisis. The so-called ""red telephone"" was not, in fact, an actual phone but a telex machine that sent written messages. This technology was already old-fashioned at the time.
""However, unlike a telephone, it couldn't be tapped,"" the historian Bernd Greiner explained in an interview with DW.
This was very important to both superpowers. ""They wanted to make sure that no other party, whoever it might be, would be able to listen in to their communications,"" said Greiner.
The first test sentence sent from the US to the USSR sounds cryptic: ""The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog 1234567890."" What was its significance? It contains every letter of the English alphabet and all the numerical digits.
Initially, the hotline was not a telephone, let alone a red one, as depicted in various movies. Greiner, an Americanist and expert on the Cold War, describes its establishment as symbolic.
""It was an external signal to reassure the world that they had understood the value of bilateral emergency communication and that they didn't want to let things go as far as they had in that perilous situation in the fall of 1962.""
Greiner quotes the then US president, John F. Kennedy, and his secretary of defense, Robert McNamara, as saying they came up against the limits of their scope for action. The lesson learned from the 1962 missile crisis was that it had not been managed: The outcome depended on chance and the other side's goodwill. It was, therefore, imperative to find other means and forms of communication.
The hotline was seldom used in its original form as a telex. ""It was activated a few times for testing, but they did not resort to it in any acute decision-making situations,"" says Greiner.
Whenever there seemed to be a severe threat to world peace, it was the classic telephone leaders reached for — during the Six-Day War between Israel and several Arab countries in 1967, for example, and again during the Yom Kippur War in 1973. On both occasions, there was a risk that the conflict would trigger a global crisis, as the US supported Israel, and the Soviet Union was on the side of the Arabs.
In those dramatic times, the antiquated telex was replaced by a satellite phone. Then, with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the end of the communist dictatorships in Eastern Europe and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, an early warning system between Washington and Moscow — now the capital of Russia rather than the USSR — began to appear superfluous.
Furthermore, technological innovations, especially the Internet, have created alternatives for rapid and secure communication. The direct link between Washington and Moscow has run on state-of-the-art technology for decades. Channels of communication for use in crisis situations also exist between other capitals worldwide.
The ""hotline"" is still popular as an early warning system. One would assume that the ""red telephone"" would have been ringing off the wall since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. However, it is hard for outsiders to assess whether or not the hotline has, in fact, been used.
""We don't know,"" says Bernd Greiner. ""This form of communication is naturally not disclosed.""
According to Greiner, US President Joe Biden is known to have spoken by phone on a few occasions with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.
""But what happens beyond that in terms of contact at the mid-level or the military level is outside our knowledge,"" he said.
Greiner, who until 2018 was the head of the Berlin Center for Cold War Studies, doubts that any hotline can help in the current war in Ukraine.
""The problem is that the established communication, between the armed forces in particular but also between diplomats, has virtually broken off. At those levels, there is a sort of silence,"" said the historian. ""This is what differentiates the situation we are experiencing today, against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine, from the situation at even the height of the Cold War"" — when the ruling powers in Washington and Moscow decided to set up the hotline.

https://www.dw.com/en/david-alabo-afrofuturism-and-hope/a-66672305,ARTS,David Alabo: Afrofuturism and hope 30.08.2023,"The exhibition ""Surreal Futures,"" now on show at the Max Ernst Museum in Brühl, a German town just south of Cologne, features 31 artworks from 19 different countries.
The exhibition explores how surrealism can contribute to giving visibility to ""traumatized identities and bodies, as well as wounded landscapes,"" as the exhibition's accompanying text puts it.
In other words, ""Surreal Futures"" deals with nothing less than the major issues of our time, including climate change, environmental destruction, identity, colonialism and racism, reflecting artistic confrontations with these issues in a rapidly changing world.
The show, curated by Patrick Blümel, is divided into three thematic chapters: ""Digital Bodies,"" ""Transforming Landscapes"" and ""Future Worlds."" 
It is the museum's first exhibition with a digital focus, and it includes digital collages generated by 3D software, virtual reaIity and digital tools.
Works by Ghanaian-Moroccan artist David Alabo are also prominently featured in the show.
Alabo has been exploring many of the aforementioned themes in a multidisciplinary way for years and is one of the well-known representatives of Afrofuturism, a worldwide aesthetic movement that encompasses art, literature, music, film and science and that is created by African authors, mostly in the diaspora.
DW met David Alabo for a conversation on August 28, after the exhibition opening.
DW: What is your personal definition of Afrofuturism?
David Alabo: I love that question. I define Afrofuturism as a reimagination or reinterpretation of both futures and pasts that may have not existed or may have existed and there is a sense of hope or optimism you can get when you're imagining a future that you know isn't based necessarily on reality.
As an Afrofuturist, the main idea or driving force behind my work is to create a sense of optimism, hope and empowerment for people that see the work. African art has most of the time been quite drenched in pain and suffering, based on the history of colonialism and slavery, and a lot of these really real and serious topics.
And I think the job of an Afrofuturist specifically is to ask questions about how could we see our people? How could we see Black people? How could we see African people? How could we see people in the diaspora? Thriving in places that are imagined or surreal?
But I also like to have my art piece almost like a canvas for people's thoughts and expressions and for them to find some sense of healing through the art.
So, surrealism as healing instead of an escape into a dream world?
I'm not trying to remove the Black experience or my experience from reality, but I feel like when you look at the art and you meditate on it and you heal on it, it's a reflection of your reality seen through a different lens or seen through a different perspective, which I think is so important because a lot of the times we need a sense of healing, hope and optimism, because we do live in a world that's quite cynical, quite dystopian. We're always hearing news about the world's going to end.
So in a way, there's a fine line between creating a world that isn't based on reality, but at the same time allows people that experience my art or other Afrofuturist art to draw some sort of lessons to the world and bring and relate it back to their own existence.
You speak of a past that ""might have been."" So, an imaginary past that we could strive for in the present?
I like to take the real symbols of Black power, Black resilience, like those common motifs of the raised fist, the Black Panther and also Black people. But I recontextualize them by putting them in new spaces, in new worlds that gives them a new meaning. Otherwise, I feel like the art would be a little too abstract.
When I create objects or sculptures, they're not necessarily based on things that I've seen before in my life.
I think I was drawn to surrealism because it allows me to tap into the subconscious, the unconscious and things that kind of pop up in my head. Art has been a great way for me to make sense of my own life and experiences, and I hope that that's what is transmitted through it when you see it.
There is indeed a renaissance of surrealism ...
It seems like the more we get into this tech-driven world, where we're being fed so much information about our reality, we want to see things that maybe don't exist.
I am using a lot of software and a lot of technology and at the same time, I am conscious of the fact that the people behind the technologies I'm using might not necessarily be Black or African. So, I think it's important as well for the Afrofuturist to ask questions about who is in charge of the technology or the structures that a lot of artists use.
In a way, it's as much about me consuming technology as it is about questioning it or trying to build. So I know the future for me is where I'm very much involved, not only in the consumption of technology, but also in its creation and development as a way to have more representation and a more equal amount of voices represented.
In the field of digital art, AI is also becoming an increasingly important topic. Where do you see the advantages and disadvantages of this technology?
We have models and programs that can turn out art on an incredible level and speed that is almost impossible for us to replicate as humans. But my point is that we should not be blinded by ignorance or to be afraid of it. I think that it's important for us artists to learn more about it — it doesn't mean you have to use it — but you can learn more about it just so you can be aware of how your place in this world might be shifting.
It's never going to replace what makes us human.
I use AI specifically for administrative things or for the things that take away time for me to create art, whether it's to answer emails or help me research something.
It doesn't have to necessarily be directly involved in my art, but it can allow me more time to be ""human."" Especially after this show, when I met some of the people that use AI more directly, I realized that I'm just tapping the surface. There's so much I need to learn and I'm not in a rush because everybody's saying ""Oh yes, artists are gonna be done. Journalists are gonna be done."" No, that's just fear mongering.









What is your experience of the exhibition here?
I think it's beautiful that they've been so progressive in trying to show not only just futuristic or new media art, but also art from underrepresented communities. And it's very brave of the museum to not only host this, but to make sure that the artists are present. It's just as important as the people that make it be there than just the art.
The exhibition ""Surreal Futures"" is on show at the Max Ernst Museum in Brühl until January 28, 2024.

https://www.dw.com/en/venice-film-festival-celebrates-cinema-despite-hollywood-strikes/a-66648828,FILM,Venice film festival celebrates cinema despite Hollywood strikes 29.08.2023,"Three years ago, in August 2020, at the height of the COVID pandemic in Europe, as we were all getting used to words like ""social distancing"" or the ""R"" reproduction rate, the Venice Film Festival defied the odds and held an in-person celebration of cinema.
It was an odd affair — temperature checks outside hotels, masking in the screening rooms — but it was a sign of hope for film fans. As movie houses were being shut and forecasters were predicting the death of the theatrical experience, the world's oldest film festival was still going, still showing the best new cinema in the world in dark rooms filled with (socially distanced) strangers collectively experiencing what the French call the seventh art.
COVID guidelines are gone for this year's Biennale, which runs from August 30 to September 9. The masks are off, there'll be no temperature checks and audiences in the Lido theaters will be packed in cheek by jowl.
But with both the Hollywood writers and actors on strike, Venice 2023, the festival's 80th anniversary, looks to be a similarly strange and hopeful affair.
The strikes mean many of the biggest films in Venice this year will arrive at the festival with no stars to walk the red carpet. That includes Netflix's ""Maestro,"" a biopic about the renowned Jewish conductor Leonard Bernstein directed by Bradley Cooper, his sophomore feature after the blockbuster success of ""A Star is Born,"" which premiered in Venice in 2018; David Fincher's new thriller ""The Killer,"" starring Michael Fassbender and Tilda Swinton; and ""Poor Things,"" the latest piece of period weirdness from Yorgos Lanthimos (""The Favourite""), starring Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo. 
The unions — SAG-AFTRA for actors, WGA for writers — have forbidden their members from promoting any so-called ""struck productions,"" meaning movies made by a major studio or streaming service, the very people with which the guilds are fighting over a new contract. (Netflix produced ""Maestro"" and ""The Killer""; Searchlight, a division of Disney, made ""Poor Things"").
""Challengers,"" a menage-a-trois drama starring Zendaya from ""Call Me By Your Name"" director Luca Guadagnino, which was set to open Venice this year, pulled out due to the strike. Now, the movie won't come until sometime next year.
SAG-AFTRA has been handing out interim waivers to some independent productions to let them do promotion at Venice and attract attention from buyers to pick up their films.
So Adam Driver, who plays legendary Italian carmaker Enzo Ferrari in ""Ferrari,"" a new biopic by ""Heat"" director Michael Mann, is expected on the Lido. As are Priscilla Presley and Sophia Coppola, who will fly in for Coppola's drama ""Priscilla,"" which tells the story of Elvis' teenage bride from her perspective. Cailee Spaeny plays Priscilla, while Jacob Elordi portrays Elvis.
And there will be plenty of European stars punting around Venice. Mads Mikkelsen, last seen as a Nazi annoying Harrison Ford in ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"" returns to his native Denmark for ""The Promised Land,"" a period romance from ""A Royal Affair"" director Nikolaj Arcel about the man who tried to tame the barren Danish heathland.
Caleb Landry Jones will be on hand for ""DogMan,"" a buzzy film billed as a potential comeback movie for out-of-favor director Luc Besson. Much of the cast of Roman Polanski's out-of-competition film, ""The Palace,"" including German star Oliver Masucci (""Dark""), Britain's John Cleese and French icon Fanny Ardant, are expected. However, the director, still a fugitive from US justice over a decades-old sexual assault case, is not.
Venice's decision to screen the new Polanski movie, alongside the latest from  Woody Allen, the French-language ""Coup de Chance,"" has been predictably controversial. Both men are triggering figures for many in the #MeToo movement and beyond. Expect calls for boycotts and even red-carpet protests when their films hit the Lido.
Looking past the strikes and the scandals, this year's Venice lineup could turn up some real gems. Italian art house maestro Matteo Garrone (""Gomorrah"") is in competition with ""Io Capitano,"" a refugee drama that follows the journey of two young men from Dakar to Europe.
Polish directors Malgorzata Szumowska and Michal Englert return to Venice with ""Woman Of,"" a transgender love story sure to be a hot-button topic back home, where LGBTQ rights are under attack from the country's far-right government.
And ""Selma"" filmmaker Ava DuVernay makes history as the first Black female director in the Venice competition with ""Origin,"" a drama about the origins of the systems of racism and hierarchy that has shaped America.
There are some mainstream movies in the mix — Richard Linklater's action comedy ""Hit Man,"" Liam Neeson-starrer ""In the Land of Saints and Sinners"" — and art house purists will be rushing to see ""Evil Does Not Exist,"" the latest from ""Drive My Car"" director Ryusuke Hamaguchi; Wes Anderson's new short, ""The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar,"" based on a collection of stories from ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" author Roald Dahl; and ""Aggro Dr1ft,"" an experimental, video-game-inspired film from ""Spring Breakers"" director Harmony Korine, featuring rap star Travis Scott and shot entirely in infrared.
Film fans will also say goodbye to the late, great William Friedkin, who died last month and whose final film, ""The Caine Mutiny Court Martial,"" premieres in Venice this year.
At 80, the Biennale still looks spry, and while the red carpet star power might be a few watts dimmer this year, Venice offers a promising reminder that great movies are still getting made. When the strikes end, hopefully soon, film fans will be spoiled for choice.

https://www.dw.com/en/zip-it-up-the-zippers-130-year-history/a-66660527,LIFESTYLE,Zip it up: The zipper's 130-year history 29.08.2023,"It has perhaps lost in popularity through the COVID pandemic, as people working from home often prefer elastic waistband pants. But whenever we are required to get out of the house, it reappears everywhere on our coats, trousers and bags: the zipper.
Work-from-home style isn't the first challenge the zipper has faced throughout its 130-year history, with button-fly jeans regularly making a fashion comeback. And everyone knows how frustrating it can be when a zipper gets stuck.
But 130 years after its patent was registered, the zipper has defended its title as an ultimate fashion accessory.
Early models of a similar clothing fastener were launched as early as the 1850s. But they rusted and often opened unintentionally. They were awkward to use and too expensive.
An American traveling salesman, Whitcomb Judson, developed an improved version of the fastener in 1890, receiving a patent for his ""clasp locker"" on August 29, 1893. Shortly after, he presented his invention at the Chicago World's Fair.
Judson's clasp locker was designed as an alternative to long shoelaces on boots. But apparently, not everyone found tying shoes tedious, and his invention was met with widespread indifference.
It took another decade for Judson and his partners to relaunch the device after improving its technology. Other engineers continued to optimize the invention, including in Europe.
When serial production of the mechanism started, the US military became one of its first bulk buyers, integrating zippers into the troops' clothing and gear during World War I. 
It wasn't until the late 1930s that the invention finally revolutionized fashion.
As was often the case for fashion innovations at the time, the zipper was initially used only for men's clothing, as it was deemed inappropriate for women to wear clothes that could be taken off quickly.
When finally applied to women's clothes, zippers were placed discretely on the side instead of in the crotch area to avoid drawing attention to a woman's intimate parts.
In Germany, mostly men wore fly trousers until the late 1960s when jeans became accepted as a genderless clothing item.
But to this day, many manufacturers still design pants differently according to gender: Zippers in women's fashion are traditionally zipped up with the left hand; for men's clothes, with the right hand. It's a legacy of the pre-zipper era when button plackets in women's fashion were designed for wealthy ladies dressed by their maids.
Now, this distinction hardly exists with unisex clothing, even though it is still the norm for shirts, blouses and suits.
Initially made of metal, zippers were later made of other materials, such as nylon and plastic. Manufacturers have also developed zippers that can open from both ends.
But beyond the technological improvements, the basic principle has remained the same: The zipper is made of two flexible strips of fabric with rows of metal or plastic teeth that fasten by hooking into each other when pushed together by a slider.
At the end of the 1950s, US space agency NASA also contributed to zipper technology when developing its high-pressure space suits, designing an air-tight sealed zip that could withstand pressure. They were used during the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969, the first moon landing.
However, the suits were not suitable for longer ventures into space, as are common nowadays, which is why NASA discarded the zipper. Yet fire-resistant and chemical-resistant successors to the NASA technology are still in demand today, notably in gear for fire departments and chemical plants.
The zipper has also found its way into pop culture. Hollywood rebels Marlon Brando in ""The Wild One"" (1953) and James Dean in ""Rebel Without a Cause"" (1955) sported an iconic style, casually wearing their jackets half-zipped up.
Even in 1971, the zipper still managed to spark controversy. That year, The Rolling Stones released their legendary album ""Sticky Fingers,"" whose album cover was designed by pop art icon Andy Warhol.
It featured an actual metal zipper. Although it didn't reveal any genitalia when unzipped, just relatively harmless cotton briefs, it was seen as scandalous at the time.
In Spain, Franco's regime censored the ""obscene"" album, which led to an alternate version being designed, depicting a woman's fingers crawling out of a tin can of syrup — which many find far more disturbing than zip-up pants. The track ""Sister Morphine"" also had to be removed from ""Sticky Fingers"" for the Spanish market, even though almost all of the album's tracks also revolved around drugs, from ""Brown Sugar"" to ""Bitch.""
Today, 130 years after it was first patented, the zipper is here to stay. Japan's YKK group, the world's largest zipper manufacturer, produces an estimated 1.5 billion units annually.

https://www.dw.com/en/at-102-iris-apfel-is-as-stylish-as-ever/a-59000546,LIFESTYLE,"At 102, Iris Apfel is as stylish as ever 29.08.2023","One necklace isn't enough. There should be at least five — and they should get your attention. A single bracelet is boring. Go for 10 at a time. On each arm. And glasses should be bold. 
Iris Apfel's jewelry rattles along whenever she moves, and her oversized round glasses have become her trademark. The style icon, glamour girl, fashion designer and interior designer turns 102 on August 29.
The exceptional centenarian is not afraid of extravagant clothes and eye-catching makeup. Her hair is colored bright gray, her lipstick bright red, pink or orange.
She has been dubbed the ""oldest teenager in the world,"" and her Instagram account has more than 2.8 million followers. Her guiding philosophy has also been widely quoted: ""I don't have any rules, because I would only be breaking them, so it's a waste of time.""
That was her recipe for success right from the start.
Born in New York City in 1921, Apfel grew up during the Great Depression. Her mother advised her to buy a single simple black dress— that way she would always have something to wear, as it can be worn in casual and more dressy contexts. It all depends on the accessories you add.
The young Iris never forgot her mother's advice.
At age 11, she discovered a brooch she really wanted in a basement shop in Greenwich Village, a neighborhood in New York. It cost $0.65, and she saved every penny she could find to finally buy it.
It was her first shopping experience, and it launched one of the largest private jewelry collections in the United States.
To this day, Apfel still hunts for the right accessory in boutiques of all price ranges, at flea markets and in secondhand shops. She combines items that no one else would consider combining, mixing haute couture with junk, as well as shapes and patterns that supposedly do not go together. And when Apfel wears them together, they end up harmonizing. That's her great talent. She just dares and doesn't follow any trends. Instead, she sets them herself.
Young fashion designers flock around her wherever she appears, whether at a gallery opening or a fashion show.
Apfel presents her own collections with a lot of humor but also with meticulousness. She'll often add the finishing touch to a model's look — perhaps an extra necklace — before they head out to the catwalk.
Apfel only recently started working as a fashion designer. For decades, she was a successful interior designer who was in great demand among the rich and famous in the United States.
Her fabric creations were unique. Together with her late husband, Carl, whom she was married to for 68 years, Apfel traveled all over the world to find inspiration. She worked with various weavers to realize her very specific ideas, and she specialized in reproducing forgotten fabrics from past centuries.
Apfel's reputation even brought her to the White House, where she worked for nine US presidents. Even though she has never revealed too many details about working with them, she has hinted at the fact that former first lady Jackie Kennedy was a rather complicated client.
Apfel's evolution into a fashion star was thanks to a 2005 exhibition at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Harold Koda, the curator of the New York museum at the time, had heard of Apfel's jewelry and clothing collection. Apfel has dedicated several rooms in her apartment on New York City's Park Avenue to her clothes. Creations by Dior, Lagerfeld, Saint Laurent, Galanos and Ungaro hang next to flea market finds and items from department stores.
Koda worked his way through Apfel's collection and finally transported around 300 items of clothing and several hundred accessories to the museum. The resulting exhibition was a huge success — and Apfel became a pop culture icon. There's now even a series of Iris Apfel emojis.
After her husband died in 2015, shortly before his 101st birthday, Apfel did not retire but instead launched various new projects. Among others, she designed jewelry for the elderly with integrated technology that checks the wearer's health and alerts an ambulance in case of an emergency.
She's irritated by the fact that older people have been largely forgotten by designers and has repeatedly pointed out that no older woman can identify with 15-year-old models. As a result, she ended up signing her first modeling contract at the age of 97.
Even at 102, Apfel is still not thinking about stepping back from her working life, and is still active as a designer and curator. 
A week ahead of her birthday, she launched the Erstwilder x Iris Apfel collection consisting of 19 bright and bold pieces including brooches, necklaces and earrings. Other recent collections include a line of clothes for H&M, and iconic eyewear for Zenni Optical.
""I think retiring at any age is a fate worse than death,"" she said as became a centenarian in 2021. ""Just because a number comes up doesn't mean you have to stop.""

https://www.dw.com/en/why-the-goethe-medal-could-spark-political-controversy/a-66631806,ARTS,Why the Goethe medal could spark political controversy 28.08.2023,"Georgian cinema professional Gaga Chkheidze will receive the official badge of honor from the German state this year, as will Taiwanese curator and dramaturg Yi-Wei Keng, and the OFF-Biennale curatorial collective from Hungary.
The award ceremony took place in Weimar on August 28, on the birthday of German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The president of the Goethe-Institut, Carola Lentz presented the cultural-political award during a ceremony.
This year's choice of prize-winners is likely to stir controversy, especially the selection of Gaga Chkheidze, from the former Eastern bloc country of Georgia.
Gaga Chkheidze, until recently director of the internationally renowned Tbilisi Film Festival, has fallen out of favor with the ruling Georgian Dream Party. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, he publicly criticized Georgia for not immediately distancing itself from Russia.
That stance cost him his position as head of the Georgian National Film Center. In addition, he was expelled by the country's national film funding organization, the Georgian Filmfund.
The Tbilisi Film Festival's office on the site of the old Soviet film studios was closed, film grants were cancelled, and the festival's budget was cut.
Born in Georgia in 1957, Gaga Chkheidze has always been considered a friend of Germany and a ""cultural bridge builder,"" and not only between those two countries.
From 1976 to 1980, he studied in Jena, in the central German state of Thüringen. In the 1980s, he worked as the director of the German school in Tbilisi and taught German literature at the Georgian capital's Ilia State University. In 1988, he organized a Georgian film retrospective at the Arsenal cinema in Berlin, for which he smuggled films across the Soviet border in his car. In the 1990s, he was a translator and program coordinator for the International Forum of New Cinema at the Berlin International Film Festival, before launching the Tbilisi International Film Festival in Georgia in 2000.

This coincided with the founding of a National Film Institute in Tbilisi, which gave Georgian films a new boost. The budget for film promotion was tripled, movie theaters sprung up, and more and more films made it to international festivals, from Berlin to Toronto. Georgian cinema drew attention from the European film market.
""Gaga Chkheidze's commitment to film is crucial to Georgia's connection to European and international institutions and programs, film markets and festivals,"" the Goethe Medal award jury said in their citation.
Indeed, Chkheidze's festival concept appealed to both filmmakers and audiences alike. Soon the Tbilisi Film Festival became an international meeting place for filmmakers.
As director of the Georgian National Film Center, Chkheidze promoted the digitization and restoration of Soviet-era Georgian films. The preservation of the Georgian cinema heritage is another of Gaga Chkheidze's achievements. 
But the Russian invasion of Ukraine also had an impact on Georgia. The Tbilisi festival came under increasing pressure, as demonstrated by the firing of its director.
""Unfortunately, here in Georgia we are on the front line between democracy and autocracy,"" Chkheidze said in a recent interview with Deutschlandradio. There are many signs that political development in the country is heading in the wrong direction,"" he said. ""It's moving more toward authoritarianism — I don't want to say to dictatorship, but totalitarianism, we've already had that during the Soviet era. No one in Georgia wants that anymore."" But the danger is real, he said.
 
Analysts say Georgia is indeed teetering between Moscow and Brussels. 15 years after its war with Russia, the country officially has aspirations of joining the European Union, which is offering the prospect of membership but still denying the country candidate status. ""Society is completely divided,"" the dpa news agency quotes Tbilisi sociologist Iago Kachkachishvili as saying. ""The majority wants to join the EU, but many hardly understand that the road is long.""
The ruling Georgian Dream Party claims to be Russia-friendly. Its chairman, Irakli Kobachidze, emphasizes the high tourism revenue from Russians, the equivalent of about €900 million ($972 million) every year.
It is true that Georgia's government always appears pro-European to the outside world, says Kachkachishvili. ""But it's doing nothing to set itself on a course to EU membership; rather it's becoming more and more pro-Russian.""
Two years ago, the documentary film ""Taming the Garden"" painted a picture of the situation in Georgian society. In it, Georgian director Salome Jashi tells the story of centuries-old trees that an influential man collects for his private park. 
The man — presumably Georgia's ex-prime minister and party leader Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his billion-dollar fortune in the finance and commodities business — remains unnamed in the film. Jashi's theme is rather the uprooting of people, in both real and metaphorical terms.
""Taming the Garden"" caused a sensation at film festivals around the world, including the 2021 Berlin International Film Festival. To this day, the film is not allowed to be screened in Georgian cinemas.
The Goethe Medal for Gaga Chkheidze arrives in the midst of this political tangle, Georgia's struggle for its course between Russia and the West. For the pro-Russian camp, the prestigious cultural-political award could be seen as an affront. To pro-Western factions, the award will be a sign of encouragement. In any case, the Goethe Medal is likely to cause a stir in Tbilisi.
Another Goethe Medal goes to Taiwan this year, with curator, playwright and translator Yi-Wei Keng being honored. He has brought important impulses to the Taiwanese theater scene, says the Goethe-Institut, including in the areas of experimental theater, children's theater and theater for people with disabilities.

Under his direction, the Taipei Arts Festival has developed into the most important festival for performing arts in Taiwan. Guest performances and co-productions with Europe, the United States and Japan are cited. Yi-Wei Keng has also brought German theater productions to Taiwan, such as those by the Deutsches Theater Berlin, the group Rimini Protokoll and Raumlabor Berlin.
Yi-Wei Keng, born in 1969 in Taiwan, first studied philosophy. In Prague, he worked with non-verbal theater. Back in Taiwan, he began working in theater and as an author. Since 2012, he has been artistic director of the Taipei Arts Festival.
Finally, the third Goethe Medal honors the OFF-Biennial Budapest.
Founded in 2014 as the ""Garage Biennale,"" the art show sees itself as a grassroots movement to strengthen the local art scene in Hungary. Initially supported by a handful of art experts, the project has since developed into an independent platform for artists and art enthusiasts. 

The OFF-Biennial collective, consisting of six curators, rejects public subsidies as well as cooperation with state cultural institutions. Starting in its first year, the art show has attracted a lot of international attention.
With three editions to date — in 2015, 2017 and 2021 — it is now considered an internationally acclaimed event. Most recently, the OFF-Biennale Budapest was invited to documenta fifteen in Kassel with two projects.

In a scandal that has seen the resignation of director Hatrwig Fischer, the museum had initially said that ""items from the collection"" had been stolen without giving a specific figure.

""I will give you an estimate of around 2,000. But I have to say that's a very provisional figure,"" Osborne said in an interview with BBC radio on Saturday.
""We have started to recover some of the stolen items, which is a silver lining to a dark cloud,"" Osborne said.
The museum said the missing pieces include gold jewelry, semiprecious gems and glass dating from the 15th century BC to the 19th century AD.
The museum was first alerted to the missing items in 2021, when it was contacted by British-Danish art historian and dealer Ittai Gradel.
Gradel told The Associated Press that he noticed objects for sale on eBay that had reportedly belonged to a collection donated to the museum in 1814. He said he then found the identity of the seller though PayPal, who turned out to be a museum staff member who has since been fired.
According to Gradel, the museum's deputy director said a thorough investigation had found no improprieties and ""he basically told me to sod off and mind my own business.""
In his resignation statement on Friday, Fischer said the museum ""did not respond as comprehensively as it should have in response to the warnings in 2021."" He also apologized to Gradel, whom he previously implied had withheld some information.
On Saturday, Osborne attributed the museum's failure to act on warnings to ""potential groupthink"" that ""just couldn't believe that an insider was stealing things, couldn't believe that one of the members of staff were doing this.""
""We believe we've been the victim of thefts over a long period of time and, frankly, more could have been done to prevent them,"" he added.
As a former Conservative finance minister under Prime Minister David Cameron, and later the editor of the influential London Evening Standard newspaper, Osborne is a comparatively high-profile chair of the board of trustees. He was once seen as a potential successor to Cameron, until the 2016 Brexit referendum results led to rapid and far-reaching personnel changes in the Conservative Party.
London's Metropolitan Police said on Thursday that officers had interviewed a man in relation to the reported thefts, and the museum said it was taking legal action against the same individual. No arrests have been made.
The British Museum is one of the most famous galleries in the world.
Its collections include the Rosetta Stone, which unlocked the language of ancient Egypt, scrolls bearing 12th-century Chinese poetry and masks created by the Indigenous people of Canada
Critics say many of these items — most notably the Pantheon Marbles from Greece and the Benin Bronzes from Nigeria — were stolen and should be repatriated.
The museum claims that it is protecting the world's cultural heritage.
""We want to tell the British Museum that they cannot anymore say that Greek heritage is more protected in the British Museum,"" Despina Koutsoumba, head of the Association of Greek Archaeologists, told the BBC after news of the thefts emerged this week.

This is Nagura's third air guitar title.
The Japanese performer is now the most decorated air guitar player in the 28 years the competition has been held, organizers said.
Second place went to Aapo ""the Angus"" Rautio from Finland. The host nation's competitor won the event the first five consecutive years it was held, but Finland has never been able to claim the top spot since.
Last year's winner Kirill ""Guitarantula"" Blumenkrants, now representing France but formerly a winner as a Russian competitor in 2015 as well, finished third.
A total of 18 people competed in the 2023 championship in Oulu.
Air guitar refers to simulating the playing of a guitar without holding an instrument. Competitors perform to music at the competition.
The championship has been held each year since 1996 — with the exception of 2020 when COVID stopped the event — and was founded in the central Finnish city of Oulu.
""Air guitar playing is not instrumental sports or arts, nor does it require any special venues or skills, so it is accessible to all,"" organizers said in a statement. ""Air guitar can be grasped regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, sexual orientation and social status.""
The organization said that it aimed to ""promote world peace"" through air guitar.
The Air Guitar Championships are part of the broader Oulu August Festivals, which includes a number of cultural events.

https://www.dw.com/en/ludwig-ii-bavarias-fairytale-king-and-his-dream-castle/a-64859703,HISTORY,Ludwig II: Bavaria's 'fairytale king' and his dream castle 25.08.2023,"Perched on a cliff in the Bavarian Alps near Füssen, Germany, the Neuschwanstein Castle is the epitome of the idyllic. Its spires soar to the heavens, while the surrounding landscapes are an invitation to daydreaming. It's the stuff of fairytales, so much so that the man who had it built is dubbed the ""fairytale king"" — Ludwig II of Bavaria, who was born in 1845.
""Neuschwanstein is nestled in this Alpine landscape. Reminiscent of a theatrical setting, Ludwig II aimed to unite architecture, art and landscapes into a Gesamtkunstwerk — a complete artwork,"" Alexander Wiesneth, of the Bavarian Palace Administration, told DW.
Just weeks after the mysterious death of Ludwig II in 1886, Neuschwanstein was opened to the public. It was an ironic twist of fate, as the king had it built as a private refuge for himself, desperately seeking solitude.
Modeled as a medieval knight's castle, inspiration for Neuschwanstein came during Ludwig II's travels in 1867 to Wartburg Castle near Eisenach, Germany and to Chateau de Pierrefonds in France.
As the eccentric Ludwig II himself wrote to his revered friend, opera composer Richard Wagner, in May 1868:
""It is my intention to rebuild the old castle ruin […] near the Pöllat Gorge in the authentic style of the old German knights' castles, and I must confess to you that I am looking forward very much to living there one day,"" as the Bavarian Palace Administration notes. 
Construction of the ""new castle"" that was to include 200 rooms began in September 1869 and continued over decades, but was never fully completed.
The building melded various styles that included towers, chapels and arches, but also featured modern innovations like central heating, flushing toilets and a bell system to summon servants.
Neuschwanstein's design was also dedicated to Wagner, whose operas ""Tannhäuser,"" ""Lohengrin"" and ""Parsifal"" profoundly influenced Ludwig.
The Singers' Hall boasts gilded frameworks and frescoes depicting knights, courtly love and other legends of medieval times, like the Holy Grail. The ceiling features zodiac signs, while wall images show Parsifal's son, the ""Swan Knight"" Lohengrin. Ludwig II himself had identified with such figures since his youth.
Yet these majestic rooms, like the Throne Hall and the Ballroom — begging to be filled with illustrious guests and lavish parties — remained empty. In the end, the king simply wanted his peace.
With the construction of Neuschwanstein dragging on over many years, Ludwig himself only lived there briefly before his mysterious death at the age of 40 — officially ruled to be a suicide by drowning, a theory that has, however, been disputed.

Ludwig II's lifeless body was discovered floating in Lake Starnberg, near Munich, along with the corpse of his physician, after the two had set out on an evening stroll in June 1886. 
But it's not just Neuschwanstein's lavish, fairy-tale design that has made the castle famous.

Its role as a depot for Nazi-looted artworks during World War II has also made it rather infamous, as featured in George Clooney's 2014 film ""The Monuments Men.""
After German troops invaded neighboring France in 1940, Adolf Hitler authorized the taskforce led by Alfred Rosenberg to ""search libraries, archives, lodges and other philosophical and cultural institutions of all kinds for appropriate material and to seize such material,"" which included cultural holdings by Jews, as noted on the Smithsonian Institution's American Archives of Art and at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum sites.
Between 1940 and 1945, Nazi officials transferred stolen valuables, primarily from Jews, to locations throughout Europe, and later, to Germany, including salt mines, monasteries and castles.
Neuschwanstein Castle was ideal as a depot and site for the Rosenberg taskforce headquarters. Tucked away near the Austrian border, far from the capital Berlin or other likely Allied targets, it provided ample space.
Ultimately, when Allied forces stormed Neuschwanstein in 1945, they unearthed catalogues, photo slides and lists documenting more than 20,000 artworks and other pieces that had been stolen by the Nazis, including Rothschild jewelry and furniture, as well as the ""Ghent Altarpiece"" masterpiece by the Van Eyck brothers.
Many of these items had stemmed from France. It was due to the valiant efforts of French curator Rose Valland that the Allied task force discovered the Neuschwanstein cache in the first place, said one of the ""Monuments Men,"" art historian S. Lane Faison Jr., in an interview found at the Archives of American Art.

""She pretended to be a [Nazi] collaborator,"" Faison noted of Valland, who worked at the Jeu de Paume Museum in Paris, one of the Nazis' collection points before they shipped stolen wares to Germany.
For years, Valland had secretly tracked where the art was being transported and her meticulous records auspiciously landed in the hands of Allied forces.

Toward the end of the war, the Munich Central Collecting Point (MCCP) was established, with the aim of returning artworks looted by the Nazis to their rightful owners.
Matthias Memmel, responsible for provenance research at the Bavarian Palace Administration, stressed to DW with regard to ""The Monuments Men"" that ""Neuschwanstein Castle was happy to cooperate with the film project, as it made the historical merit of the American Allies, the 'Monuments Men,' better known to a broad international public.""
Maria Blenk, Bavarian Palace Administration museum specialist, explained to DW that visitors do ask questions about Neuschwanstein and the Second World War. ""Americans in particular, but also British people, remember the history of the 'Monuments Men' and many have or had family members who were stationed in Bavaria, so they are interested in the more recent history of Neuschwanstein.""
Neuschwanstein was only one of Ludwig II's lavish construction projects. Others include the rococo Linderhof Palace and the baroque Herrenchiemsee Palace. Together, they are up for consideration as a UNESCO World Heritage site.
Whether the dream of a king, the site of a former Nazi-looted art depot or as the inspiration for Walt Disney's Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty castles, Neuschwanstein remains in the imaginations of many. As the Bavarian Palace Administration's Alexander Wiesneth notes, the similarity between King Ludwig II and Walt Disney is clear: Their vision of architecture was about ""telling a story.""

https://www.dw.com/en/loch-ness-monster-search-in-scotland-where-is-nessie/a-66620033,OFFBEAT,Loch Ness monster search in Scotland: Where is Nessie? 24.08.2023,"Come August 26 and 27, 2023, researchers will try to solve the mystery of the Loch Ness sea monster by using infrared cameras.
Drones will observe the surface of Loch Ness and record even the slightest movement. A hydrophone will detect unusual underwater sounds, while scores of volunteers will stand on the shore to immediately report possible signs of life.
""It's an organized observation of Loch Ness, which is great,"" Nessie searcher Steve Feltham told the dpa news agency. ""The more eyes on the water, the better."" The man has been searching for the monster for more than 30 years — arguably longer than anyone else.
The large-scale operation is organized by the Loch Ness Centre in Drumnadrochit, a town on the western shore of the lake, and a volunteer research team called Loch Ness Exploration.
""Loch"" is the Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Scots word for a lake or sea inlet, while ""Nessie"" is the now iconic nickname of the mythical, serpent-like creature that's believed to have roamed the depths of the freshwater lake named Ness, located in the Scottish Highlands, for centuries. 
As early as the year 565, the Irish abbot, missionary and scholar St. Columba of Iona is said to have encountered the ""water monster"" on the River Ness. In the 7th century biographer St. Adamnan's book, ""The Life of Saint Columba,"" it is reported that the saint saved a man who had been attacked by the creature. ""Columba made the sign of the cross in the air and invoked the name of God, while commanding the wild beast, 'You will go no further! Do not touch the man! Leave at once!' At the saint's words, the monster fled in fear, as if it were being pulled back with ropes, even though it had only been a short distance away from the man.""
1,000 years later, Nessie was said to have slain three men, but otherwise the sea monster has been surprisingly peaceful. What is certain from these sightings, however, is that Nessie has many years under its belt. This also means that it has enough experience to shake off hunters in the up to 230-meter-(750-feet)-deep lake. And they have been on its trail several times — at least since it finally became a celebrity in the media age.
In 1933, hotel manager Aldie Mackay stormed into a bar and announced to the astonished patrons that she had just seen a ""monster"" in Loch Ness, and that the waters of the lake had been very churned up.  The Scottish regional newspaper Inverness Courier picked up the story of the mysterious creature — and it spread like wildfire. Reporters came from London, and a circus offered 20,000 English pounds to capture the monster. The following year, a motorcyclist described how the creature had crossed the road. It reportedly moved forward on flippers and had a sheep in its mouth. As soon as it reached the lake, it submerged into the waters. Now, there was no stopping the Nessie fans from coming from all over the world.
On April 19, 1934, the tabloid Daily Mail published the first photo of Nessie. Supposedly taken by a renowned London doctor, the snapshot, which went down in history as the ""Surgeon's Photograph,"" showed a kind of prehistoric plesiosaur. A sensation — no one doubted the authenticity of the photo.
The big game hunter Marmaduke Wetherell was commissioned by the Daily Mail to search for the Loch Ness monster. And he delivered; he had his stepson Christian Spurling, an accomplished model maker, construct a monster from a toy submarine, with the head and neck modeled in plastic. The doctor who allegedly took the ""evidence"" photo thus took pleasure in having been part of the hoax — it supposedly gave the story more credibility that a bystander had shot the picture — until it was exposed as a trick 60 years later.
However, this did not stop the Nessie hunters from continuing to search for evidence of its existence. Again and again, there were new photos, which were examined in laboratories of the British defense museum and NASA for their authenticity — and fakes were repeatedly said to not be among them.
In 1972, the lake was systematically searched under the direction of the Loch Ness Investigation Bureau, which wanted to prove the existence of a prehistoric creature — yet, to no avail. In 1987, boats using sonar technology were finally used to track down the supposed secret. Operation Deepscan saw 24 boats equipped with echo sounders carrying out a thorough sonar sweep of the 56-square-kilometer (about 14,000-acre) loch. While the sonar detectors reacted to large objects several times, Nessie was not detected. In 2019, an international team of scientists attempted to catalog all living species in Loch Ness by extracting DNA from water samples. Their conclusion: A large species does not live in the loch, and the sightings could at most be giant eels.
Every year, the curious travel by the thousands to Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands, hoping to catch a glimpse of the legendary lake monster. Nessie remains elusive, despite repeated claims of sightings over the centuries. The first such account was by a medieval Irish monk. This photo of Nessie was published by the Daily Mail in April 1934. Its authenticity has been debunked.







Countless speculations about Nessie's true identity have been made over the years: From Greenland shark to a catfish to even a primeval lizard. Skeptics try to explain the supposed sightings of the monster with seals, jumping fish, water birds, floating deer, drifting logs and even mirages.
But despite all the deniers, Nessie enthusiasts have not been deterred from searching for the monster even in the 21st century. ""We are the custodians of this unique story and are invested not only in creating an unforgettable experience for visitors, but also committed to... uncovering secrets that lie beneath the waters of the famous Loch,"" Paul Nixon, chief executive of the Loch Ness Centre, told the Daily Mail.
Of course, the whole thing could be mistaken for a marketing stunt, as Nessie attracts countless tourists to Scotland. But maybe Nessie really does exist. ""We hope to inspire a new generation of Loch Ness enthusiasts,"" Alan McKenna of Loch Ness Exploration told British media agency PA. ""By joining this large-scale surface search, you have the opportunity to personally contribute to this fascinating mystery that has intrigued so many people around the world.""
If Nessie does make an appearance, it has nothing to fear. Back in 1934, it was placed under species protection. At that time, the Guinness Brewery had put a bounty of 500,000 English pounds on the monster — and the legend of Nessie should still keep future generations guessing about whether it really exists.

https://www.dw.com/en/restituted-sculpture-of-alexander-the-great-a-forgery/a-66599759,ARTS,Restituted sculpture of Alexander the Great — a forgery? 22.08.2023,"Stephan Lehmann first saw the bronze sculpture of the ancient ruler in 2000 at the Winckelmann Museum in the small town of Stendal in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt. The archaeologist, now retired, was then a professor at the university in Halle — and curious about the well-preserved ancient work, which was considered a sensation.
The sculpture, a bust of Alexander the Great, was on loan from a private collector, it was said. For Lehmann, one thing mattered: was it a fake? ""I was there, I looked at it and I thought it was blatantly fake,"" he told DW. ""That this was an original was out of the question.""
Alexander III of Macedon (born ca. 356 BC), commonly known as Alexander the Great, was a king of Ancient Greece. He spent most of his ruling years conducting an extensive military campaign throughout western Asia and Egypt. By the age of 30, he had created one of the largest empires in history, ranging from Greece to India.
Lehmann searched the museum catalog for provenance information, but to no avail. He asked the museum point-blank but got no answers. He repeated his requests, unsuccessfully. ""Museums are never amused, that's clear, when important pieces on display in their main hall are called into question,"" he says.
That did not stop the archaeologist from continuing to call the sculpture a fake. Lehmann sees it as his duty to reveal the history of suspicious works. He fears that a rare find from antiquity might find its way into a museum catalog and thus be academically legitimized.
That's why, in 2015, he cataloged 36 ancient works of art that he believes to be fakes. Among them was the bronze statue of Alexander the Great. He also organized an exhibition on the subject at the Archaeological Museum of the University of Halle and called it: ""Long Ago in Stendal.""
He also accused the museum of allowing itself to be misused as a ""laundry"" machine. The Winckelmann Society promptly sued him for libel. At the time, however, the court did not address the question that really interested Lehmann: Is the sculpture genuine?
But that would have been impossible, because immediately after the exhibition, the sculpture disappeared — it was considered lost for a long time. 
Lehmann believed it was the heist of a well-made forgery of an international art dealer mafia. To detect something like this, you need decades of experience, a great deal of knowledge — and intuition.
Those skills helped Lehmann when a Swiss collector sent him the supposedly ancient bust of Emperor Augustus for examination. ""When you look at the details, you also have doubts as to whether this is really fake. It's perfectly done, after all. It's already masterful,"" he admitted to DW.
He had the sculpture scanned by computer tomography. Counterfeiters, as the assumption goes, have ancient coins melted down to cast new pieces from them. Theoretically, it's the perfect deception, because the material really is 2,000 years old. 
But the depiction of Augustus did not stand up to scrutiny. Some criteria, such as the degree of corrosion, did not line up, so it could be proven that the item had been cast more recently.
Lehmann suspects the bust is from the counterfeiting workshop of someone known as the Spanish Master, who has yet to be identified. Whoever this person may be, they often create busts of ancient rulers and give them a beautiful patina. The facial features are always very well preserved, as though by magic. And of course, the counterfeiters create pieces that are currently in demand on the art and antiquities market.
""Regarding the value of archeological objects, bronze statues are in the premiere category. They're something very special, and of course they draw the most attention,"" says Lehmann.
Whenever a find of this sort turns up, there's no shortage of people wanting to buy it. ""We're talking about money, money, and more money as the dominant factor,"" says Oscar White Muscarella, who for many years was a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He has watched dealers funnel fakes into the market, like galleries and art fairs. But the main gateways are auction houses, according to Muscarella. ""At some point I realized that dealers in particular, but also collectors, were selling their fake objects at auction,"" he says.
""I once talked to a dealer about it, and he just smiled. What they do is this: Instead of selling fakes in their own store, they put the objects up for auction under a false name, then say, 'This ancient artifact comes from an old collection,' they invent a provenance, a Monsieur X. That way, these dealers don't show up in person in front of the buyers.""
The bronze bust of Alexander the Great comes from the New York art trade, from the gallery of Robin Symes. The Briton is considered one of the key figures in the illegal trade in ancient objects and has since gone into hiding. His company was liquidated, and the art objects stored in various countries were confiscated. So the bronze sculpture of Alexander the Great also found its way back to Greece, as one of 351 objects identified as looted art. Alexander is ""Number 11.""
Stephan Lehmann learned about the issue from a Greek colleague who sent him a newspaper clipping with a photo. ""He just wrote, 'Can this be?' And I looked and saw a box, and packed inside was 'Alexander from Stendal.' The accompanying text said it was a piece from the art warehouse of the criminal Robin Symes in Geneva... And so it reappeared.""  
It's clear the bust should not have been exhibited in Stendal without proof of origin, as Lehmann had demanded in 2000. He still considers it to be a fake but is pleased that it has been found again. After all, it could have been melted down, or be in the living room of a billionaire. ""But to turn up as a retransfer to a state, that's spectacular,"" Lehmann thinks.
Now, he hopes the material will be investigated. He assumes Athens is aware the bronze is suspected of being a forgery. After all, the Greek Minister of Culture herself holds a doctorate in archaeology. It is now up to the Greek state to investigate the provenance of the Alexander bronze. If it is genuine, it's worth many millions of euros. Or it could be worth only 100 euros, the value of its material. That, however, would be an inglorious end for Alexander the Great.

https://www.dw.com/en/gamescom-2023-bigger-and-more-international/a-66590606,SOCIETY,Gamescom 2023: Bigger and more international 22.08.2023,"Gamescom, the largest video games trade fair in the world by its own account, opens its doors in Cologne on Wednesday. More than 1,220 exhibitors from 63 countries will show their new products over the next five days. Hundreds of thousands of gamers will patiently join long lines to spend 15 minutes at a time trying out games scheduled to be released in the coming months. It will be loud and crowded in the Cologne exhibition halls when the international gaming industry comes together.
""This year more than ever, Gamescom is a reflection of the global gaming culture: dynamic, international, creative, diverse and huge,"" boasts Felix Falk in a press release. He's the managing director of the German Games Industry Association, which co-organizes the trade fair.
But it wasn't a foregone conclusion that Gamescom would even take place at all this year. The E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) in Los Angeles, for decades the most important trade fair for video games, has not returned after the COVID-19 pandemic forced cancellations.
That's in part because, during the pandemic, many games companies experimented with presenting their new titles through live streams. In the meantime, streaming formats such as Nintendo Direct, State of Play, Xbox Games Showcase, State of Unreal or Ubisoft Forward have become well established. So developers and publishers are no longer dependent on in-person events to stay relevant. By partnering with streamers, they can reach their target audience directly — and at a considerably lower expense than when they travel around the world to trade fairs with a bunch of people and purpose-built demo versions. It's perhaps no wonder that big names like Sony Interactive Entertainment (makers of Playstation), Electronic Arts (""EA Sports FC 24""), Epic Games (""Fortnite""), Take Two (""Grand Theft Auto"") or Activision Blizzard (""Call of Duty"") have chosen to skip this year's Gamescom.
For the first time ever, a South American country is the official partner country of Gamescom. Brazil's gaming industry has grown considerably in recent years, and it has concentrated mostly on the PC and mobile games market. More than 1,000 games studios are now located in Brazil, in contrast to the 133 companies in 2014. Some 13,200 people are employed in the sector in Brazil, and are increasingly producing for the international market, which is made affordable by digital distribution channels.
According to the ""Brazil: Game Industry Report 2022,"" fewer than half of the studios in the country receives state support. Many games are financed by the founders themselves, with help from their friends and family and individual investors. The result is that, so far, none of the really big games has come from what is the fifth largest country in the world. Developing so-called AAA  games — the blockbusters of the gaming world, like ""Elden Ring"" or "" Hogwarts Legacy "" — can cost at least $100 million (€91 million).
But the Brazilian studios don't have anywhere near that kind of budget. So the country produces mostly indie games, rendered in pixel graphics or a comic-book style. The Brazilian delegation to Gamescom is made up of almost 60 studios, which are bringing titles from various genres, including horror games, rhythm games, role-playing games, 2D jump-and-runs, and the cute cozy game ""Gaucho and the Grassland,"" a farm simulation game. 
That's likely to appeal to gamers in Germany, where simulator games have a dedicated fanbase. The game called ""Farming Simulator"" is once again present at Gamescom with an extensive exhibition stand. Major exhibitors like Bandai Namco Entertainment (""Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon,"" ""Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections""), Microsoft (""Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty,"" ""Forza Motorsport,"" ""Immortals of Aveum,"" ""Payday 3,"" ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2,"" ""Starfield"") and Nintendo (""Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown"") are among those offering a preview of their upcoming releases.
Indie games are developed by smaller studios that work independently of big companies. It can be worthwhile visiting the Indie Arena Booth, where visitors can try out international indie games and chat directly with the developers. The mood is friendly, and gamers are often surprised by the creativity of the smaller studios.
The Retro Area at Gamescom offers gamers a chance to take a deep dive into the history of video games and play vintage titles like ""Pacman."" Cosplayers have a special village just for them, and organizers have also announced an e-sports tournament.
On the eve of the first day of Gamescom, Opening Night Live (ONL) traditionally takes place, hosted by Canadian video game journalist and founder of the Game Awards, Geoff Keighley, and featuring trailer and gameplay reveals as well as developer talks. 
German Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck will officially open Gamescom. His ministry is responsible for state funding of digital games and also organizes the German Computer Game Prize. Computer game promotion is a big issue in Germany because the gaming industry here lags behind the US, Canada and France. It's no coincidence that Germany does not produce AAA games. Federal funding of €50 million ($55 million) per year has been available since 2020, but that's not enough. Currently, no further federal funding is available to the industry. High labor costs, a high tax burden and a shortage of game developers — just under 12,000 people work in the gaming industry in Germany — make it difficult for studios to keep up with global competition.
But Gamescom offers German studios a good opportunity to present their games to an international audience. Despite the lack of really big games from Germany, there are still remarkable smaller titles that are appreciated worldwide. The pirate adventure ""Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew"" from the makers of ""Desperados 3"" could become another insider tip, or ""The Darkest Files,"" a detective game where players solve crimes from the Nazi era.

https://www.dw.com/en/beyond-fame-the-art-of-the-stars-at-d%C3%BCsseldorf-show/a-66587873,ARTS,'Beyond Fame' — The art of the stars at Düsseldorf show 21.08.2023,"For the exhibition ""Beyond Fame. The Art of the Stars"" at the NRW-Forum in Düsseldorf, curator Alain Bieber has selected artworks by 18 celebrities. On show are photos, paintings, drawings and sculptures. The mix of genres is as varied as the range of artistic personalities, which includes musicians, actors, writers, sports stars and politicans.
How did he come up with the idea for the show? ""We thought it was exciting to see all the people who were involved with art,"" Bieber told DW. He admits that, with celebrities, making visual art is often a marketing stunt. ""Ed Sheeran did an action painting once, and Britney Spears once did some flower paintings while wearing a bikini, he pointed out. For ""Beyond Fame,"" however, he says he chose people who take art seriously.
He says there are ""big surprises"" among them — works by German singer Tim Bendzko, for example, or even former tennis pro Michael Stich, that have never been shown in a museum before. ""You wouldn't think they'd paint like that."" None of the selected artists had ever attended an art academy, he said. ""We want to leave judgment of the works to our audience,"" Bieber says. ""We're excited to see the reactions.""
""We cultivate Joseph Beuys' expanded concept of art here,"" explains Bieber, ""which asserts that everyone is an artist."" One example, he says, is former Wimbledon champion Stich. After retiring from tennis, he took up painting as a hobby, studied art history for two semesters and set up a studio. Stich said it took him 10 years before he went public with his paintings. ""My art is a reflection of my personality and my emotions,"" as the exhibition organizers quote the former tennis pro.
The paths the selected personalities have taken to artistic expression are as varied as the people themselves are. And their choice of artistic medium is sometimes surprising. Some works are closely linked to their respective biographies. Some artists are at home in several creative fields at once. One of them is the German theater actress, author and visual artist Lea Drager. She draws images of popes, male and female, with which she questions patriarchal systems and hierarchical structures. Fellow German actress Meret Becker is active as a singer, actress and visual artist. Her work deals with social issues and she also campaigns for women's rights.
Musicians like Bryan Adams and Peter Doherty have sold millions of albums — and they've been creating visual art for many years. ""Good photographs are like time capsules that store memories,"" Adams told the Düsseldorf museum. Doherty, the scandal-ridden singer of British band The Libertines, sees art — along with poetry — as ""an expressive way to process his life."" He works with blood and charcoal, combining drawing, painting, sculpture and collages of images and text.
The works by Canadian musician Claire Elise Boucher, aka Grimes, are populated by the kinds of fantasy figures — nymphs, cyborgs and manga characters — that she also portrays herself as in her music videos. According to the museum, she draws inspiration for her drawings and album covers from mythical and psychedelic images, borrowing figures and motifs from Art Nouveau and Surrealism, and has recently begun using artificial intelligence.
Whether as a counterbalance or a complement, people in politics also engage in artistic activities. For example, German Green Party politician Anton Hofreiter makes no secret of his enthusiasm for
nature. He earned a PhD in botany at the start of his political career, and he paints and draws flowers. For him, as the museum says, this is ""a way of recognizing how things really are.""
""Beyond Fame"" promises to arouse curiosity about little-known facets of prominent contemporaries. ""Some of our artists,"" promises curator Bieber, ""should soon be on view in other museums."" For the time being, the artistic director of the NRW-Forum is banking on the ""Barbie"" effect: ""Whether you love Barbie or not — you simply have to have seen the latest movie!""
The exhibition ""Beyond Fame. The Art of the Stars"" at the NRW-Forum runs until January 24, 2024.

https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-studio-babelsberg-under-threat/a-66569238,FILM,Germany's historical Studio Babelsberg under threat 18.08.2023,"Located just outside Berlin, Studio Babelsberg has been under a cloud after the US company Cinespace — a subsidiary of the real estate company TPG Real Estate Partners (TREP) — became the majority shareholder at the beginning of 2022, since when hardly any filming has taken place at the studios.
German film director and Oscar winner Volker Schlöndorff added to those fears as he spoke of the ""danger"" posed to the studio's existence. He said that since the company Kino Bidco, a subsidiary of Cinespace, became the main stakeholder, there were hardly any films being produced in the historic studios. Schlöndorff, who has also served as the CEO of Studio Babelsberg in the past, warned that the studio could be wiped out of existence.
Earlier this week, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke out in support of preserving Studio Babelsberg amid fears over the future of the oldest large-scale film studio in the world. He said he wanted to keep the multi-billion dollar business of film and TV productions in Germany.
""We will make far-reaching decisions in the course of next year at the latest,"" Scholz said Tuesday during a visit to the film studios. The industry ""must be maintained here and elsewhere in Germany because once it's gone, it's hard to rebuild,"" he added.
Babelsberg's co-chief executive officer, Andy Weltman, called for competitive tax incentives so Germany could ""once again play a leading role leading role"" in film production.
According to a 2021 industry forecast published by Statista, the film industry's revenue in Germany by 2025 will be around €10.5 billion ($11.4 billion) and largely stagnating.
Founded in 1912, the Babelsberg film studios are regarded as the cradle of German film and the oldest large-scale studio in the world. Today the studios have, among other things, 21 state-of-the-art studios, outdoor sets covering more than 173,000 square meters and Europe's largest prop warehouse.















Among the films shot in Babelsberg were 1927's ""Metropolis"" by Fritz Lang and ""The Blue Angel"" with Marlene Dietrich in 1930.
In recent years, Babelsberg was used for Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" and ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" by Wes Anderson as well as the series ""Babylon Berlin.""

https://www.dw.com/en/poland-seeks-to-deter-russia-with-huge-military-parade/a-66543850,POLITICS,Poland seeks to deter Russia with huge military parade 15.08.2023,"August 15 is a date steeped in symbolism for Poland. On this day in 1920, Polish soldiers and volunteers halted the Red Army's advance on Warsaw, changing the course of the Polish-Soviet War in the process.
In the months preceding this victory, Soviet troops had notched up several military successes and were on the cusp of capturing the capital of the Second Polish Republic.
The Soviets had hoped that the subjugation of Poland would be a milestone in a much bigger campaign: Leaders Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky had both wanted to reach Berlin ""over Poland's dead body."" Once there, they intended to start a world revolution.
Poland's victory that day, which went down in history as the ""Miracle on the Vistula,"" put a stop to the Soviet march westwards.
Since the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe more than 30 years ago, Poles have celebrated this historic victory. The Polish parliament declared August 15 Armed Forces Day in 1992.
Even though a military parade has been held on this day every year since 2007 — except during the years of the COVID-19 pandemic — this year's weapons display put all previous parades to shame.
On Tuesday afternoon, crowds gathered in the scorching summer sun to watch 2,000 soldiers and 200 military vehicles — including US-made Abrams tanks and South Korean K2 tanks — parade along the River Vistula and past Warsaw's Royal Castle.
The airspace over Warsaw was secured by Black Hawk helicopters and F-16 fighter jets. Soldiers from the US and a number of allied European countries marched alongside their Polish counterparts.
Addressing the troops and the crowds, Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said that it was ""a perfect day to show our strength, to show that we have built powerful armed forces that will effectively defend our borders without hesitation.""
After the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Poland's government launched a massive program to modernize the country's army as quickly as possible. According to the Polish Defense Ministry, almost 140 billion Zloty (€31.5 billion/$34 billion) will be spent on weaponry this year alone.
The government will be cooperating not only with the US, which has long been an important partner, but also primarily with South Korea.
The close cooperation with Germany, which was an important partner for Poland in the years after the collapse of Communism, has deteriorated in recent years because the leader of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, views Berlin more as a threat than an ally.
All attempts to arrange a so-called ""ring exchange"" — whereby Poland would supply Ukraine with its old Soviet-designed tanks and get modern German Leopard tanks in return — ended last year with ill-feeling between the two neighboring counties. 
Several years ago, Defense Minister Blaszczak made it clear that he wants Poland to have the biggest army in Europe. He recently announced that Poland now has more than 175,000 soldiers under arms. Experts estimate that of this number, only 125,000 are professional soldiers. The rest is made up of members of Poland's Territorial Defense Force and other volunteer formations.
Party leader Kaczynski on Monday also stressed the importance of a large army, saying that ""the Polish army must be increased to 300,000 soldiers. We have to buy very large amounts of weapons.""
He also quoted the old Latin adage ""If you want peace, prepare for war.""
But making Poland more secure is apparently not the only objective of this defense policy. The intention is plainly that the policy should also help the ruling PiS get re-elected on October 15.
Speaking in a televised debate on Sunday, Andrzej Zybertowicz, an advisor to President Andrzej Duda, openly admitted as much, saying that ""the military parade is intended to mobilize patriotic feelings, thereby helping the PiS in its election campaign.""
Since last Friday, so-called ""military picnics"" have been taking place across Poland. In more than 70 locations around the country, soldiers have been meeting locals and tourists and showing off their state-of-the-art weapons.
Army recruitment officers were also on hand to generate interest in army careers among young people. State television later showed images of excited children in uniforms and helmets handling real weapons.
PiS politicians also attended the picnics, demonstratively showing themselves alongside soldiers and officers. There could be no doubt that they were campaigning, even though the Polish constitution expressly states that the country's armed forces must remain neutral in political matters.
Speaking on the Polish private television channel TVN, Retired General Boguslaw Pacek spoke of a ""monopolization of the army by [political] parties.""
PiS accuses the opposition liberal Civic Platform (PO) under Donald Tusk of allowing Poland's armed forces to become run down during its time in power. It argues that between 2007 and 2015, many barracks were closed down and severe cuts were made to military spending.
What PiS politicians do not say, however, is that many Polish soldiers were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and that numerous armament projects — such as the procurement of the Patriot air defense system — were launched in this period. 
Another topic that is inextricably linked to Polish security is the question of the Polish-Belarusian border, which is also becoming an election issue.
After the Russian mercenary Wagner Group was moved to Belarus, Poland announced that it was sending 10,000 soldiers to the border region.
The fence erected along the Polish–Belarusian border is proving to be more porous than intended: Despite the barbed wire, undocumented migrants succeed in entering Poland every day.
PiS accuses opposition leader Tusk of having opened Poland's borders for this kind of illegal immigration. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has referred to Tusk as ""the greatest threat to our security,"" while Kaczynski has said he is the ""greatest enemy of our nation"" and accused him of wanting to provoke a civil war in the country. 
PiS would ideally like security to remain on the campaign agenda right up until election day in exactly two months' time.
In a further bid to improve its chances at the ballot box, the government will also be holding a referendum on a number of hot-button issues on election day. Polish voters will be asked, among other things, whether they ""support the removal of the barrier on the border between Poland and Belarus"" and whether they ""support the admission of thousands of illegal immigrants from the Middle East and Africa.""
The opposition has warned that this is ""election manipulation"" and is calling for a boycott of the referendum.

https://www.dw.com/en/poland-stages-biggest-military-parade-since-cold-war/a-66542531,POLITICS,Poland stages biggest military parade since Cold War 15.08.2023,"Poland held a massive parade in its capital Warsaw on Tuesday to showcase its military might, as the country seeks to strengthen its defense capabilities in the wake of the war in neighboring Ukraine.  
The Armed Forces Day parade took place on the anniversary of the 1920 Battle of Warsaw, in which Polish troops defeated Bolshevik forces advancing on Europe.
""August 15 is not only an opportunity to pay homage to the heroes of the victorious Battle of Warsaw and to thank contemporary soldiers for defending our homeland,"" Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said.
""It is also a perfect day to show our strength, to show that we have built powerful armed forces that will effectively defend our borders without hesitation.""

Around 2,000 soldiers from Poland and other countries of the NATO military alliance participated in the parade.
They marched through Warsaw accompanied by 200 items of defense equipment, while helicopters including Black Hawks and jets including F-16s and FA-50s flew overhead.
Among the equipment on display were US-made M1A1 Abrams tanks, South Korean K2 tanks and K9 self-propelled howitzers, as well as HIMARS mobile artillery systems, Patriot air defense systems and Polish-made Borsuk infantry fighting vehicles.   
Poland, a NATO member, supports Kyiv in its war against Russia.
The country's right-wing government, headed by the Law and Justice (PiS) party, has been beefing up its defense preparedness, spending over $16 billion (€14.6 billion) on tanks, missile interceptor systems and fighter jets over the past two years.
PiS has vowed to double the size of the army and spend around 4% of the nation's economic output on defense this year.
The increased spending and weapons procurement have bolstered Polish defense capabilities.
Poland's President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, on Tuesday criticized past governments for not prioritizing the military.
""The last eight years have been a time of rebuilding the Polish army,"" he said. ""Earlier we had the opposite situation, a decrease in the size of the Polish armed forces.""
Opposition lawmakers, however, accuse the government of instrumentalizing the military for its own political gain.
""I wish you (soldiers)... that you never again have to provide a background for political hatred,"" Marcin Kierwinski, a lawmaker from liberal opposition party Civic Platform (PO) wrote on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.
Poland is scheduled to hold a general election in October, in which PiS will seek to win a third term.

https://www.dw.com/en/the-first-digital-palestinian-embroidery-database/a-66468203,SOCIETY,The first digital Palestinian embroidery database 12.08.2023,"Zain Masri still remembers the vibrant feeling of completing her first cross-stitched motif at the age of 7. ""For years, it remained my favorite holiday activity at my grandmother's place in Jordan,"" the 31-year-old told DW. 
Masri, who works in marketing in Dubai, reconnected with her family tradition of cross-stitching Palestinian patterns during the pandemic. ""I joined online embroidery communities for inspiration while spending lots of time at home,"" she said. Masri quickly realized, however, that a shortage of high-resolution patterns was one of the main challenges for the global embroidery community.
""There should be a place for digitalized, printable and freely available patterns as this is cultural heritage,"" Masri thought and wondered why she should be waiting for someone to launch such a database.
And so, some 24 years after her grandmother introduced her to Tatreez, which is the Arabic term for this traditional type of Middle Eastern needle work, Masri started Tirazain, the first digital embroidery database of traditional Palestinian cross-stitching patterns including the information on their origin and aesthetic features. Typical examples are palm trees, jagged patterns in different colours or patterns that resemble tiles on the Noble Sanctuary or Haram al-Sharif  in Jerusalem.
Only, creating such a database turned out to be much more time-consuming than expected. Since none of the existing digitization software options were accurate enough to decipher the stitches automatically, Masri started to break down motifs manually on digital grids.
""I've spent thousands of hours digitalizing motifs stich by stitch,"" she said, adding that this makes them printable for manual cross-stitching and downloadable for machine embroidery.
Meanwhile, around 1,000 such patterns are available for download on her database, which has been slowly growing since October 2021 and was only officially launched this summer. Her breakdown of statistics show that already more than 1,000 people access the patterns every day, and the community is growing.







While cross-stitching on dresses and fabrics has a long tradition throughout the Middle East, with the earliest findings dating back to ancient Egypt, Palestinian embroidery carries additional significance. This was recognized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, or UNESCO, who put the art of Palestinian embroidery on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2021.
""In the Palestinian culture, embroidery was always used as a story-telling technique,"" Masri said, adding that ""according to the embroidery and the color of the thread, you could tell exactly where a woman is from, if she is single, married, if she has children, is divorced or if she is a widow.""
For example, when a woman got married, her main, and often only, dress was embroidered with a red thread. Then, when the woman got pregnant, the same dress was temporarily altered with fabric patches on the sides, and later cut around the chest during the period of breast feeding. Each alteration was complemented by cross-stitching.
""When the woman got divorced or became a widow, motifs in darker colors were added and, over time, this dress depicted her personal life story,"" Masri said. ""These dresses have become family treasures as they tell the story of the women in the family.""
Menswear, however, never really carried the same traditional embroidery. The only exception was an embroidered handkerchief what was usually prepared by the future wife for the groom.
Other typical embroidered items of the dowry were pillow covers or decorative items for the household. Zain Masri, who was born in the United States, happily points to her two cross-stitched pillows on the sofa in her living room. ""I love textile art and these are just so beautiful,"" she said.
While Tirazain is Zain Masri's first private passion project, which won Bronze for the Best Community Engagement in Education, Art and Culture at this year's Anthem Awards, it is not the first time that her projects that promote digital literacy and economic empowerment for Arab women have gained attention.
For example, her digital skills education program ""Maharat min Google"" (Building capabilities with Google) has reached almost two million people in the Middle East, and her YouTube Balata project, a content hub that features hundreds of women entrepreneurs in the Arab World, is widely acclaimed in the Arabic speaking region. Over the past couple of years, Zain, who moved to Dubai in 2009, was selected to the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, and the Arab America Foundation 30 Under 30 list. She has also been appointed a UN Women Advocate and an IMF Youth Fellow.
Her two grandmothers in Jordan have many reasons to be proud of her.
""I know that for them, understanding the database is far-fetched, but when I showed them some of my finished pieces, they immediately connected with the patterns,"" Masri said, adding that ""our family tradition lives on, online and offline.""

Musk said on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that he and Sangiuliano had agreed on an ""epic location"" for the fight, without specifying where. 
""Everything in camera frame will be ancient Rome, so nothing modern at all,"" Musk wrote.
However, Sangiuliano said after the conversation with Musk that the event would not be held in Rome, adding that they agreed on holding a  ""large charitable and historically evocative event,"" which would respect and safeguard heritage sites.
Musk said the fight would be organized by his and Zuckerberg's foundations. 
Sangiuliano said that ""many millions of euros"" are expected to be donated to two Italian pediatric hospitals, and scientific research for fighting childhood diseases. 
However, the culture minister again seemed to diverge from Musk's interpretation of what was agreed upon, as the Tesla billionaire said on X that ""all proceeds will go to veterans."" 
Opposition politician Carlo Calenda, a former industry minister and head of the centrist Azione party, criticized the culture minister's willingness to entertain the possibility of the Musk vs. Zuckerberg fight.
""I find it simply mind-boggling that the Italian cultural heritage is being made available to two billionaires who want to indulge themselves like foolish teenagers,"" he said.
On June 20 this year, Musk asked on then-Twitter if Zuckerberg, who is trained in jiujitsu was ""up for a cage match.""
Zuckerberg responded a day later: ""send location.""

https://www.dw.com/en/behaim-oldest-globe-reveals-dark-side-of-human-exploration/a-66500429,CULTURE,Behaim: Oldest globe reveals dark side of human exploration 11.08.2023,"As a child, a globe gave me my first idea of our planet, even before I started school. The rotating sphere my father bought was made of plastic and could light up from the inside. Whether it was intended as a lamp or as an inspiration for a curious mind, mattered not. In any case, the globe as a lamp took away my fear of the dark hallway in the evening.
Sometimes, pointing at the globe, I would have my father show where we lived. He would point to a spot that was not surrounded by turquoise. Turquoise, I already knew that much, stood for the sea. ""And where does Mother Teresa live?"" At the time, I had a burning interest in where personalities of her ilk could be found.
But before all the countries and seas could be mapped correctly on globes, the world had to be explored, from the discoveries of seafarers from the 15th century to the dark side of the onset of colonization, all the while as the world seemed to get ever smaller.
Little did I know at the time that the world's oldest globe sat right here, in Germany.
But had I seen the globe produced by Martin Behaim at the end of the 15th century, I might have noticed a glaring absence: The continents of the Americas and Australia are nowhere to be seen, neither of which were known to central Europe at the time of its creation.
The globe, also known as the Erdapfel, now resides in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg. Shortly after its completion, which has been dated somewhere between 1490 and 1492, the Italian-born Christopher Columbus became the first European to reach America, which marked the beginning of modern globalization. Australia was first reached by the British navigator James Cook and his crew in 1770.
""What you can see clearly, and what is depicted very precisely, is central and southern Europe, the Mediterranean region and Africa. The further you go away from this region, the fuzzier it gets,"" says Sonja Missfeldt, press officer at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum.
This year, the globe was added to UNESCO's Memory of the World register as an outstanding testimony to how the world was imagined at the time.
For Jan Mokre, Head of Map Department and the Globe Museum of the Austrian National Library in Vienna, its listing as part of humanity's documentary heritage also represents an appreciation of the efforts of museums to preserve such valuable historical objects of cultural heritage, to have them professionally restored when necessary, and to make them accessible to visitors.
For Sonja Missfeldt, the Behaim Globe is a ""pioneering work of cartography."" 
It is made of various materials. The sphere, which is hollow on the inside, is covered with painted paper. A wrought iron frame holds the globe, which could originally be rotated, surrounded by a brass horizon ring.
Many people were involved in its making. Martin Behaim, who came from a patrician family in Nuremberg, had commissioned the globe. It is not quite clear why. It is possible that the specimen on display in the town hall at the time was intended to attract sponsors for global trade.
Behaim was himself a traveling merchant who is said to have participated in exploratory voyages along the coast of Africa in the 1480s.
In addition to land and water masses, the globe also contains information about foreign peoples, exotic animals and raw material deposits. Even places where goods such as spices could be extracted have been noted.
In addition, figures reminiscent of mythical creatures are depicted. Shadow-footed creatures, also called sciapods, are one example. According to Missfeldt, the depictions represent a widespread belief at the time, that there were people living in more remote regions in Africa who had only one leg and a large foot that stretched upwards.
""The Behaim Globe is an object that stands, as it were, between the times. In terms of its image, it actually represents the medieval image that Europeans had of the earth, and does not yet point at all to the new era,"" explains Mokre.
It was created at a time in which the Europeans strove for supremacy in the world, by discovering unknown countries and parts of the world, where raw materials were plundered and inhabitants turned into slaves before being shipped across the world.
For the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, the globe ""reminds us of European conquests,"" while it is also ""a memorial to African slaves who played a decisive role in the creation of our modern world,"" says Mokre.
At the time of the Behaim Globe's creation, serial production was still a long way off. Spherical models of our world had existed since Greek antiquity, but the production of each individual globe was still a challenge for the craftsmen involved. 
""People didn't have any comparable systems to draw on, but started thinking about how to vividly represent the world in 3D,"" says Sonja Missfeldt of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum.
Today, the term globe is synonymous with a model of our earth. But there are also celestial globes and those of other planets and the moon.
""Between 1520 or so and 1850, it was common to make terrestrial and celestial globes as a pair, to sell them as a pair, and to set them up as a pair. This dualism is very important because it is actually this interaction that represents the cosmos,"" explains globe expert Jan Mokre.
A very striking model that seeks to unite heaven and earth is the walk-in Gottorf Globe from the 17th century. It measures just under three meters (10 feet) in diameter and shows the Earth on the outside and the sky on the inside.
Driven by water power, this famous object, once made for a chamber of art and rarities, could rotate once around its own axis.
Earth and celestial globes in combination also exist in smaller form. In the 18th century, for example, pocket globes the size of billiard balls were popular collectors' items.
From about 1850, industrial production made the globe a mass-produced item.
And the practice of keeping a globe in private living and working environments started a bit earlier, says Jan Mokre, who dates it to the late 18th century. Among the factors that popularized ownership of the item was an improved educational situation and the fact ""that the economically strengthened middle classes wanted to represent themselves with knowledge."" Globes, along with atlases and encyclopedias, were goods that could identify a citizen interested in education.
Anyone who would like to see a special model of our planet today has the opportunity to do so in the industrial monument Gasometer Oberhausen in Germany. There hangs a monumental sculpture of the Earth with a diameter of 20 meters. It is a globe of the digital age that is part of the exhibition ""The Fragile Paradise,"" which runs until November 26.
Visitors experience it from the space perspective of astronauts. Through satellite images projected onto it, they see not only the colors and continents of the Earth, but also the footprint that humans leave on it.

https://www.dw.com/en/how-teenagers-from-the-bronx-invented-hip-hop-50-years-ago/a-66501099,MUSIC,How teenagers from the Bronx invented hip-hop 50 years ago 11.08.2023,"In 1973, the Bronx in New York City was one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the United States. Robbery, muggings and murder were part of the residents' everyday life. Youths organized themselves into street gangs, taking control of their blocks and fighting each other.
The Bronx was on fire — literally. Firefighters regularly had to put out blazes in tenement blocks, as landlords used arson to speculate on insurance premiums.
The streets were littered with debris and junk; the neglected parks attracted drug dealers, pimps and prostitutes. The entire neighborhood was crumbling, with many residential buildings empty and increasingly dilapidated.
As photojournalist Allan Tannenbaum wrote in an essay describing his personal experience of the area, in the early 1970s, the Bronx and other parts of New York City, such as the Lower East Side, Bedford-Stuyvesant or Harlem, looked like European cities after the Second World War.
There was great poverty, with a majority of residents living on welfare. Not because they didn't want to work, but because there was no employment at all.
Those who could afford it fled the neighborhood, but they also had to find a landlord who would rent them an apartment elsewhere. Although racial segregation was officially abolished in the US in the early 1970s, many white people did not want to live alongside African Americans, and continued to discriminate against them, making it difficult for Blacks to change their situation. Structural racism also contributed to the fact that it was predominantly African Americans and Latinos who stayed behind in the socially disadvantaged and neglected neighborhoods.
""At the time New York city was almost bankrupt. There was really nothing there for kids to do,"" recalls Cindy Campell in a video produced by auction house Christie's, which is holding a special auction to mark the 50th anniversary of hip-hop's founding.
At the time, Campbell was in high school and, in order to be able to buy clothes for the new school year, she decided to throw a party. Admittance for boys was 50 cents, while girls paid 25 cents, according to the flyer for her ""DJ Kool Herc Party."" 
DJ Kool Herc was her 18-year-old brother, Clive Campbell.
So on August 11, 1973, DJ Kool Herc dragged his sound system, consisting of two turntables, a mixer, an amplifier and a set of speakers, into the community room of the tenement building at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue in the Bronx.
The smell of marijuana was in the air. The bass pumped and ripped through the sweating crowd as they danced and partied in the darkened room. DJ Herc's buddy Coke La Rock grabbed the microphone, greeted the guests and started rapping.
This later earned him a reputation as the first ""MC"" (Master of Ceremonies).
Around 50 people came, friends and young people from the neighborhood. They experienced the first hip-hop party in history — before terms like hip-hop or rap had even been coined.
DJing was nothing special, and rapping wasn't new either. US comedian Pigmeat Markham had already released a track, the single ""Here Comes the Judge,"" with rhythmic spoken word in 1968.
What was revolutionary about DJ Kool Herc's technique was that he created new tracks by using the instrumental parts of other songs, breaks with drums and bass. Since those lyrical breaks are often very short, DJ Kool Herc simply used a second copy of the same record on another turntable to lengthen the excerpts, by playing them back to back. He called this technique the ""merry-go-round,"" and thereby developed a new, extremely danceable sound made of breaks.
That's also where the term breakdancer comes from — referring to those who dance to the music generated from breaks.
DJ Kool Herc mixed different styles of music in his performances. He wouldn't reveal which records he was using, to make sure people would keep coming to his parties to hear his exclusive sound.
He inherited his passion for music from his father, who was an avid record collector and had jazz, gospel and country records at home. DJ Kool Herc was also interested in soul, as well as in modern disco music. He was always looking for sounds from which he could create a beat — the basis for a good hip-hop track.
The DJ had set off fireworks on the turntables, and word spread quickly around the Bronx. Everyone came to Herc's parties, recalls rapper Coke La Rock in the Netflix documentary series ""Hip-Hop Evolution"": murderers, thieves, dancers and normal people all came to the events, which ultimately moved to the streets and parks when the lounge became too small.
The block parties were a regular feature in New York City in the 1970s. Street lamps were often tapped to supply the music system with electricity.
In order to stand out as a DJ, you had to be loud, and DJ Kool Herc had the biggest and loudest speakers in the neighborhood.
Right from the start, hip-hop was not just a music genre, but an entire culture, encompassing DJing, rap, breakdance, graffiti and knowledge. It all came together at DJ Kool Herc's parties. Just one more reason the legendary party on Sedgwick Avenue is considered the birth of hip-hop.
Anyone who wanted to hear hip-hop had to come to the block parties, because in the mid-1970s hip-hop albums weren't available for sale, nor was the music on the radio.
It wasn't until 1979 that The Sugarhill Gang's ""Rapper's Delight"" became the first hip-hop song to make the US charts. It's a song that is now considered a classic, just like ""The Message"" by Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five, which came out in 1982 and tells of life in the New York ghetto.
""Hip hop has been the Voice of the Voiceless, the story of marginalized communities, where people can tell stories about the social inequities that are happening in communities, black and brown communities. Not just here in America but all around the world,"" said Rocky Bucano, director of the Universal Hip-Hop Museum in New York, in a promotional video for the museum's planned opening in 2024.
In a video of the web video series ""Black History in Two Minutes,"" filmmaker Ava DuVernay called hip-hop the ""CNN of the Black community,"" because it poetically reports on everything that Black people experience in everyday life.
Many US rappers who have made it to the top don't come from the middle class, but from the poor backgrounds where hip-hop originated.
Moving from subculture into the mainstream, hip-hop is now one of the most popular music genres in the world, with superstars including Tupac, The Notorious B.I.G., LL Cool J, Public Enemy, the Beastie Boys, the Wu-Tang Clan, Timbaland, Jay-Z, Dr. Dre, Nas, Eminem, Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, Drake, Missy Elliott, Snoop Dogg and Kendrick Lamar, to name just a few.
From the United States, hip-hop culture has spread worldwide, influencing music, fashion, film, advertising and art.
In Germany, where a hip-hop scene with different trends has also developed over time, hip-hop is truly a political culture: In 2017, a hip-hop political party was even set up. It has yet to enter the German parliament.

https://www.dw.com/en/emmy-awards-postponed-due-to-hollywood-strikes/a-66495306,ARTS,Emmy Awards postponed due to Hollywood strikes 10.08.2023,"The 75th Emmy Awards have been officially postponed for four months, now set to air on January 15, 2024, amid an ongoing Hollywood strike among actors and writers.
The award, television's equivalent of the Oscars, historically takes place every year in or around September, celebrating the biggest shows and their casts and crews.
This year, with movies and shows' actors and writers on strike, they are unavailable to campaign for their shows or conduct promotional interviews ahead of the award.
The Television Academy and broadcaster Fox announced the new date on Thursday, confirming earlier reports regarding the postponement.
""We are pleased to announce that the 75th Emmy Awards will now air on Monday, January 15, 2024,"" said a Fox spokesman.
The postponement will bring the award ceremony to the same season as other ceremonies, including the Screen Actors Guild Awards and the Critics Choice Awards. No host has been announced yet for the ceremony.
The Writers Guild of America (WGA), which represents around 11,500 writers in Los Angeles, New York, and other locations, started in early May — the first work stoppage for them in 15 years.
Now surpassing 100 days, the strike came after negotiations with companies, such as streaming giants Netflix and Disney, ended without a deal.
On July 14, they were joined by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA).
Both actors and writers are demanding better pay to correspond to inflation rates, and assurances against the use of AI in the industry. 
Actors want assurances that their digital images will not be used without their permission. The writers meanwhile demand safeguards against the use of AI in generating new scripts based on their past work.
Both are also asking for streaming services to introduce the traditional payment method of residuals for shows hosted on their platforms. Currently, writers and actors receive a fixed annual payout for streaming shows, regardless of how successful the show becomes.

https://www.dw.com/en/india-manipur-media-violence/a-66473187,MEDIA,India: Biased media coverage exacerbates violence in Manipur 09.08.2023,"Ongoing unrest in India's Manipur state has entered its third month. The sectarian violence between the majority Meiteis and minority Kukis has also led to another casualty — the truth.
After the violence erupted in India's conflict-torn northeastern state in May, authorities blocked the internet in an effort to stop disinformation and false rumors from spreading on social media.
But by then, a lot of unsubstantiated reports and fake videos had already circulated, such as footage purporting to show Meitei women being allegedly raped by Kuki men during the first days of the conflict.
The fake news led to violent reprisals that escalated into a series of horrific crimes against Kuki women, many of whom bore the brunt of misinformation campaigns, becoming victims of targeted sexual violence.
A case in point is a video that emerged of a May incident in which two Kuki women were stripped naked and raped, then forced to parade in front of a group of men from the dominant Meitei tribe.
Journalists and media commentators who continue to report from Manipur say there is a noticeable bias in news coverage that severely hinders information gathering and reporting.
""Given the situation and geographical divisions of the communities, there is unfortunately one-sided news,"" Pradip Phanjoubam, editor of the Imphal Review of Arts and Politics, told DW.
The mostly Hindu Meiteis make up 53% of Manipur's population and live in the more prosperous valley, while the largely Christian Kukis, with a 16% population share, live largely in the surrounding hills.

""There are no Kuki journalists in the Imphal Valley and vice versa. Obviously, the full picture does not emerge and this is a matter of regret,"" said Phanjoubam.
""These are trying times. Journalists from either side do not travel.""
Some of the journalists in Imphal who spoke to DW said the editorial positions of major valley newspapers and cable news channels were ""biased."" They requested anonymity because they risk being targeted by their organizations or other outfits affiliated to the Meitei community.
In several cases, web portals have taken down news stories amid threats and fear of outraging one community and even to appease political powers.
""I know how an academic who had to apologize after she wrote in a mainstream newspaper asking for Chief Minister Biren Singh's resignation,"" a senior journalist told DW. ""She also had to make amends to the university."" 
Some of the influential mainstream publications include the popular Manipur daily Sangai Express, the most-read Meitei language newspaper Poknapham and others including The Peoples Chronicle and Imphal Free Press. The popular cable television news channels include Impact, ISTV Network and Elite TV.
News reports from the hills that surround the Imphal Valley are being downplayed by Imphal-based media outlets. In many instances, reporters based in the hills have resigned or decided to report from safer locations, such as Assam and New Delhi.
""It is difficult to know what is happening on the other side and more importantly on the ground. I get no news from Imphal and the valley and have to depend on sources which may not be completely accurate,"" said independent journalist Ninglun Hanghal, who was based in the hills of Churachandpur, the epicenter of violence, but moved out of Manipur.
Sophia Rajkumari, founder of the Eta Northeast Foundation Trust, pointed out that the press had not held accountable those responsible for the current crisis for allowing matters go out of hand.
""The press has not really focused on the dichotomy of the ruling party and its alliance MLAs still remaining in the party and ministry despite their professed problems with the chief minister,"" Rajkumari told DW. ""This is something that the press has simply not probed.""

""In many ways, the media hasn't really understood the situation — its triggers and the political aspects as well as the broader national security implications,"" Rajkumari added.
It is still not certain when internet restrictions will be lifted in Manipur. Most journalists continue to operate from the government-run media center which is internet enabled.
Mobile internet services have far greater penetration than broadband and Wi-Fi, particularly in rural areas. They are used by the majority of internet subscribers and continue to remain suspended.
""It is very tough for journalists to be neutral and who think rationally to cover news. It is tough to do authentic reporting in this current climate and dispensation,"" Beerjurekha Samom, editor of Imphal-based Heeyai Newn, told DW.

https://www.dw.com/en/tech-moguls-musk-zuckerberg-spar-online-over-fight-plans/a-66455388,SOCIETY,"Tech moguls Musk, Zuckerberg spar online over 'fight' plans 07.08.2023","Tech giant Elon Musk said on Sunday that his proposed fight with Meta head Mark Zuckerberg would be live-streamed on his social media platform X, previously known as Twitter.
Amid the professional competition between them, the duo have been egging each other into a mixed martial art cage fight since June.
It isn't clear how serious both sides are about the proposal, as most communications regarding the fight have been jocular.
No date has been set, but Musk had suggested the Las Vegas Octagon, an events center where mixed martial arts (MMA) championships are often held.
Over the weekend, Musk and Zuckerberg continued mimicking boxers taunting their opponents in the build-up to a fight. 
Musk said that the Twitter website he bought and is now trying to rebrand as X would livestream the fight and that ""all proceeds will go to charity for veterans."" 
Zuckerberg's riposte, meanwhile, was posted on his rival site Threads, and questioned whether X would have a large enough reach. 
""Shouldn't we use a more reliable platform that can actually raise money for charity?,"" he asked. 
Zuckerberg, also appeared to question whether Musk, who has a habit of issuing social media comments with his tongue in his cheek, was serious about the fight. 
He suggested an August 26 date, and said ""I'm ready today... but [Musk] hasn't confirmed."" 
The 39-year-old Meta chief executive is a mixed martial arts enthusiast who has taken part in several ju-jitsu competitions. 
""I love this sport and will continue competing with people who train no matter what happens here,"" Zuckerberg said on Sunday.
The maelstrom began when Musk provoked Zuckerberg in June by asking him if he was ""up for a cage fight.""
Zuckerberg in return asked Musk to ""send location,"" which was when Musk first suggested Vegas.
Over the years, the tech giants have clashed on several issues ranging from politics to artificial intelligence.
In early July, the duo became direct competitors after Meta launched a Twitter-like platform called Threadswhich rapidly drew 120 million users, according to Quiver Quantitative.

https://www.dw.com/en/musk-offers-funds-to-users-who-got-in-trouble-over-x-posts/a-66453301,SOCIETY,Musk offers funds to users who got in trouble over X posts 06.08.2023,"Elon Musk has promised his social media company X — formerly known as Twitter— will provide monetary legal aid to users who face blowback from their employers over controversial posts on the platform.
""If you were unfairly treated by your employer due to posting or liking something on this platform, we will fund your legal bill,"" he wrote on the site. ""No limit. Please let us know.""
""And we won't just sue, it will be extremely loud and we will go after the boards of directors of the companies too,"" the tycoon added later.
However, it was unclear if X could afford paying large legal bills for many users, as advertising income has collapsed since Musk bought the platform last October.
Musk paid $44 billion (€39.9 billion) for the company. Last month, he said the platform's cash flow remains negative because of a nearly 50% drop in advertising revenue and a heavy debt load. An upturn in advertising that had been expected in June failed to materialize.
Many users, including celebrities and others in the public eye, have found themselves in trouble over their actions on the platform.
They include comedian and actress Roseanne Barr who in 2018 wrote a racially offensive post about a senior advisor to former President Barack Obama and was dismissed from her newly revived sitcom. 
In the UK, researcher Maya Forestater was fired in 2019 for posting her views on gender and transgender issues on her Twitter account. She later sued and won an employment tribunal for wrongful dismissal.
Rapper and designer Kanye West was suspended last year amid a series of antisemitic statements. This included West posting an image that appeared to show a swastika interlaced with a Star of David. The rapper's behavior prompted German sportswear giant Adidas to end their business partnership. His X account has since been reinstated.
Despite its revenue woes, Musk says that monthly users of X reached a ""new high"" last month at over 540 million.
The billionaire has vowed to make X a bastion of free speech, but critics have accused the platform of rolling back moderation policies that helped remove hateful and offensive content.

Twitter changed its name to X and unveiled a new logo, weeks after rival Meta Platforms — the owner of Facebook and Instagram — launched a competing platform called Threads.
Amid intense competition between the social media giants, Musk in late June challenged Mark Zuckerberg to a cage fight.
Whether or not the pair make it to the ring has yet to be seen, but the banter has gained worldwide attention.
Musk, however, insisted Sunday the fight would be streamed on his social media site.
""Zuck v Musk fight will be live-streamed on X,"" he wrote in a post on the platform. ""All proceeds will go to charity for veterans.""
Zuckerberg is actually trained in mixed martial arts, and he posted about completing his first jiu-jitsu tournament earlier this year.
The 39-year-old Zuckerberg regularly trains with martial arts coaches. In turn, the 52-year-old Musk claimed on Sunday that he now brings weights with him to work and lifts during the day because he doesn't have time to work out.

https://www.dw.com/en/rebuilding-beiruts-cultural-life/a-66421890,CULTURE,Rebuilding Beirut's cultural life 04.08.2023,"More than 200 people were killed and large parts of the city devastated when close to 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate blew up in Beirut on August 4, 2020.
The blast wave was so strong that — according to UNESCO — around 640 historic buildings were impacted. It was yet another disaster for a nation long marked by civil war, political crises and economic decline.
Many cultural sites were severely damaged by the explosion, including the Nicolas Ibrahim Sursock Museum, Lebanon's oldest independent cultural institution.
But after almost three years of restoration work — helped with over $3 million (€2.7 million) in support from France, Italy and UNESCO — the building was able to reopen in May 2023.
""A miracle and a sign of hope,"" said Klaus-Dieter Lehmann, former president of the German Goethe Institute and the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, of the reopening. The Sursock Museum had for decades been an ""anchor for Lebanon's cultural scene and a showcase for the country's art production,"" he added.  
The explosion struck at the heart of cultural life in Beirut, which was once dubbed the ""Paris of the East."" In the Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael neighborhoods, many cafes, alternative spaces for poetry slams or small live concerts, as well as design studios for jewelry, furniture or clothing, were destroyed.
But for Sursock Museum director Karina El Helou, the restoration of the institution has become a ""symbol for the continuity of cultural life in Beirut.""
""The explosion destroyed a great deal,"" recalls German-Lebanese art historian and gallery owner, Andree Sfeir-Semler. ""Many musicians lost their instruments; many painters their works of art.""
Sfeir-Semler is a specialist in Arab contemporary art and runs — in addition to her gallery in Hamburg, Germany — an artistic branch in Beirut. Her exhibition rooms at the port were completely destroyed in the huge August 2020 explosion. Until today, it remains unclear who is responsible for the disaster.
""Lebanon's art scene still exists, but it exists less and less in Lebanon,"" Lehmann says of a growing exodus of creative artists due in large part to economic crises and corruption.
""Beirut's cultural scene is now spread all over the world,"" explained Anne Eberhard, director of Germany's Goethe Institute in Beirut.
Large diaspora communities have emerged in France and Germany in particular, she says, adding that ""Berlin is increasingly becoming a kind of Arab cultural capital.""
In Beirut, meanwhile, many cultural institutions have given up or downsized as the economic divide between rich and poor in the country continues to grow, notes Eberhard — and where one in five people are a Syrian refugee.
Indeed, culture has long been impacted by both economic and political instability dating to when sectarian groups divided power among themselves after Lebanon's 15-year civil war. 
""Art and literature became increasingly politicized and ideologized,"" noted Klaus-Dieter Lehmann.
Despite these barriers, art and culture are once again playing a central role in Lebanese life as emerging artists perform on the streets, in refugee camps, or organize festivals in the provinces, Eberhard explains. 
The Goethe Institute helps financially with such artistic projects, providing ""structural aid"" where there is a lack of state cultural funding. The Goethe program ""ArtEvolution,"" for example, supports young Lebanese artists in their own productions.
Artistic independence is vital to this cultural work.
""Lebanon's contemporary art,"" said gallery owner Sfeir-Semler, ""is the only entity today that doesn't depend on one of the 18 religious communities in the country.""
In Beirut, she says, a certain tolerance still exists. ""Why is there such an art scene in Lebanon and not in Syria, in Egypt, in the Gulf states?"" the art expert asks. ""Because there is no Arab city where people are as free as in Beirut.""







Giving further hope to Beirut's cultural life are plans to build the Beirut Museum of Art, or BeMA, by 2026 (see top photo).
To be located near the National Museum that preserves the country's archaeological treasures, and in the vicinity of the new Beit Beirut cultural center, BeMA could house the collection of the Lebanese Ministry of Culture.
The approximately 2,300 works of modern and contemporary art by predominantly Lebanese artists are currently still stored in depots and — according to newspaper reports — are in a miserable condition: holes in canvases, works covered in dust and mold, broken sculptures. The civil war has also left its mark here.
A fluid and transparent building design by Amale Andraos, a Lebanese architect living in the US and co-founder of the Work Architecture Company (WORKac) design firm, has been chosen for the new museum. The facade of light consists of inviting open balconies that open a view into the interior.
Private donors have already raised part of the $30 million (nearly €27.5 million) that the BeMA is expected to cost. The foundation stone has recently been placed.
And yet the deteriorating situation in Lebanon has led to a rethinking of the project.
""The past few years have been a roller coaster ride,"" Michele Haddad, who was until May the BeMA's executive director, said in Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily. 
""How to find the architecture of the new museum, what will go in there, where the artworks will come from and who will pay for it in the end, we'll have to see to all that,"" said gallery owner Andree Sfeir-Semler.
""But it's definitely better than nothing,"" she added.

https://www.dw.com/en/freddie-mercury-treasure-trove-on-show-before-auction/a-66410905,CULTURE,Freddie Mercury treasure trove on show before auction 03.08.2023,"""I like to be surrounded by splendid things,"" Freddie Mercury, the legendary frontman of rock band Queen, once said.
Now, a months-long public exhibition titled ""Freddie Mercury: A World of his Own,"" hosted by London auction house Sotheby's, allows visitors to explore the collected curios that filled ""the public and private realm of a global icon.""
In addition to being a world-renowned rock superstar, Mercury was an eclectic collector of art, fashion, furniture and jewels that were gathered over decades.
Mercury's collection was formerly preserved at the musician's beloved home, Garden Lodge in London. This shrine to the performer displayed ""a quality and diversity of works that are a testament not only to his manifold passions, but innate style, accomplished artistry, and brilliant mind,"" the Sotheby auction house said.
The special exhibition kicks off on Friday, August 4 at Sotheby'sin London. Visitors can enjoy music and champagne but are asked to honor the dress code, which is inspired by Mercury's birthday party in 1986 in which ""flamboyant hats are encouraged,"" Sotheby's stated on its website.
The exhibition ends on September 5, culminating in a series of six auctions that include stage costumes and handwritten song lyrics; woodblock prints picked up during Mercury's travels through his beloved Japan; and a white silk evening scarf. 
A certified gold single sales award for ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and an MTV video music award, as well as Adidas high-top sneakers and Mercury's signature crown and cloak ensemble, are also on display.
Parts of the collection were previously on show at Sotheby's in New York in June 2023 before traveling to Los Angeles and Hong Kong.
Freddie Mercury was born in 1946 to Parsi-Indian parents in Zanzibar, Tanzania.
Real name Farrokh Bulsara, Mercury moved to London with his parents in the mid-1960s after attending school in India and returning to his place of birth — from where he was forced to flee when the island's violent revolution broke out.
After co-founding the glam rock band Queen in the early 1970s in London, Mercury soon sang some of the greatest hits in pop music history, including ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" (1975), ""We Will Rock You"" (1977), ""We Are the Champions"" (1977), ""Another One Bites the Dust"" (1980), ""Radio Ga Ga"" and ""I Want to Break Free"" (both in 1984).
Queen sold out stadium gigs around the world in the 1970s and 80s, but front and center was Mercury with his inimitable, gender fluid persona and timeless sex appeal.
Rumors about Mercury's homosexuality circled for years. With the outbreak of the HIV/AIDS virus during the 1980s, tabloid newspapers started to question Mercury's health.
Nevertheless, while he never married, he once said that his relationship with Mary Austin, who he met in 1969, was like a union and he considered her to be ""his wife."" She allegedly inspired the Queen song ""Love of My Life.""
There are few details about when Mercury actually contracted HIV — nor about when he was officially diagnosed.
The deterioration of his health eventually prevented Mercury from going on tour and he passed away in 1991 at the age of 45. 
Immortalized in the 2018 biopic ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" Mercury's flamboyant legacy will continue to be celebrated in the London exhibition and auction.   
""Freddie Mercury: A World of his Own"" runs from August 4 through early September 2023.
For the world premiere of the biopic Bohemian Rhapsody in October 2018, Freddie Mercury fans filled London's 12,500-seat Wembley Arena, where Queen's Live Aid concert was also held in 1985.

Reubens was known for playing the character Pee-wee Herman, a cultural phenomenon that spawned numerous films and TV shows.
He died on Sunday after struggling with cancer for six years, his publicist said. The comic had not publicly disclosed his condition.
""Please accept my apology for not going public with what I've been facing the last six years,"" Reubens was quoted as saying in a statement released on Monday.
""I have always felt a huge amount of love and respect from my friends, fans and supporters. I have loved you all so much and enjoyed making art for you,"" he said.
""Last night we said farewell to Paul Reubens, an iconic American actor, comedian, writer and producer whose beloved character Pee-wee Herman delighted generations of children and adults with his positivity, whimsy and belief in the importance of kindness,"" the statement said.
""Paul bravely and privately fought cancer for years with his trademark tenacity and wit.""
""Paul Reubens was like no one else — a brilliant and original comedian who made kids and their parents laugh at the same time. He never forgot a birthday and shared his genuine delight for silliness with everyone he met,"" late night host Jimmy Kimmel said in a social media post.
Reubens was born in the northeastern state of New York in 1952. He launched his career as a comedian in Los Angeles in the 1970s.
His seminal character debuted in 1981 as part of the ""Pee-wee Herman Show"" in a Los Angeles theater in 1981.
The gray-suited persona was best known for the film ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure"" and the TV series ""Pee-wee's Playhouse,"" with Pee-wee Herman remaining a cultural fixture for much of the 1980s.
In the show ""Pee-wee's Playhouse,"" Pee-wee Herman lives in a wacky home that is visited by a series of other characters.
Pee-wee Herman largely disappeared from the entertainment scene after Reubens was arrested for indecent exposure in 1991. The character returned to screens in the 2016 Netflix production ""Pee-wee's Big Holiday.""

https://www.dw.com/en/solar-power-brightens-kenyas-energy-landscape/a-66377085,CLIMATE,Solar power brightens Kenya's energy landscape 31.07.2023,"Solar power is experiencing a significant surge in Kenya. In a parallel narrative to recent developments in Croatia, it appears that for numerous individuals, the surge in activity is not solely motivated by environmental concerns.
Solar energy has emerged as the more cost-effective option — and this is the primary reason behind its growing popularity.
Hezel, whose house in Nairobi boasts a state-of-the-art solar plant on its rooftop, says she harnesses the power it generates for a wide range of purposes. ""Heating, lighting. I only use electricity for the cooker.""
In a recent statement, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz bestowed high praise upon Kenya, referring to the country in East Africa as a ""climate champion and model.""
Kenya has managed to meet a staggering 80% of its power demand through the utilization of green energy sources.

Kenya has set its sights on achieving a remarkable feat by the year 2030 — a goal of reaching a 100% mark.
The focus on geothermal energy has been prominent thus far. However, the significance of solar energy is steadily growing.
The surge in the use of solar energy is a welcome development for many Kenyans given that the country suffers from a persistent issue of frequent power outages.
A number of residents have turned to utilizing sizable diesel generators as a contingency plan. However, the exorbitant costs associated with these generators have rendered them unattainable for a significant portion of the population.
Also, some remote regions in Kenya remain disconnected from the national power grid. The advent of solar energy has ushered in a new era of independence for individuals, said Annissa Osman, CP Solar's CEO.
""Maybe 15 years ago the only solar item people used was a calculator. Now more and more people are looking to adopt more solar in their everyday life,"" she said.
Five years ago, Osman created CP Solar, which boasts a diverse clientele including trade, industry, and private customers.
Hezel, like many Kenyans, did not opt for solar energy solely out of a desire to safeguard the environment and combat climate change. She said it is a cost-effective alternative to relying on Kenya's primary energy provider. ""It is a lot cheaper than what Kenya Power charges,"" she said.
Since making this eco-conscious decision, she said her electricity bill has experienced a significant decline.
Today, Hezel finds herself paying a mere third of her previous expenses, a substantial reduction that has undoubtedly left her both delighted and financially relieved.
A recent study conducted by the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania reveals that Kenya has emerged as a global leader in solar energy generation — creating favorable conditions for harnessing solar power.
According to the report, for Kenya's ambitious goals to be achieved, the country must take more proactive measures and enhance its geothermal energy resources alongside wind and solar power.
There are already a number of solar power stations in operation in the country, contributing to the country's national grid with a steady supply of electricity.
In Garissa, for example, lies the largest one. With a staggering power output of 55 megawatts, the facility has the capacity to generate electricity that can meet the needs of over 600,000 households. Constructed by a prominent Chinese corporation, this entity has been in full operation for three years.
Previously, it was primarily Western companies that held the reins in this sector. Charles Ngare, the CEO of Chloride Exide, a prominent solar panel manufacturer, said there has been a significant shift in the situation. ""We found that solar panels from the Far East were actually much cheaper than we would produce them,"" he told DW.
Ngare added that, ""no other country produces solar plants in Kenya anymore. The competition from China is simply too strong.""
Kenya's market bears witness to China's undeniable dominance, as evidenced by the exclusive reliance of Chloride Exide, on Chinese suppliers for all their large-scale solar panels adorning the roofs of their factory halls.
In the sprawling factory halls, the company diligently manufactures a wide range of products, including car and solar batteries.
The production process is known for its high energy consumption. But thanks to the implementation of solar panels, the company has managed to reduce a portion of its energy expenses. Ngare thinks that the future of energy in Kenya is solar.
""Solar energy is actually booming in Kenya. Demand for solar products actually doubled in the last about two years,"" he said.

There is currently no indication that demand will decrease in the near future.
A recent UNESCO report shows that solar energy is making waves in the remote regions of Kenya, which have long been deprived of conventional sources of power.
For urban residents such as Hezel in Nairobi, the solar plant installed on her rooftop has become an enduring fixture in her plans for the foreseeable future.
""The sun is always there. We never get to a point where there is no sun,"" Hezel told DW.
In rural communities, the potential for real change is also being unlocked by solar-powered water pumps and lamps.

https://www.dw.com/en/hiv-cured-dusseldorf-patient-marc-franke/a-66368371,SCIENCE,"Cured of HIV: Meet the Düsseldorf patient, Marc Franke 31.07.2023","Marc Franke, a 54-year-old from western Germany, was dealt his first blow in 2008, when he learned he had HIV — a diagnosis that ""ripped his world apart,"" he said.
""I had always used protection, but apparently one time I didn't and it got me,"" he told DW in his home in the German region of North Rhine Westphalia. Thankfully, HIV isn't the death sentence it used to be. After decades of medical progress, patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) have the same life expectancy as those without the infection.
But, three years later, when Franke was only 42, he started feeling sick again. He thought he'd come down with pneumonia. But, days after checking into the hospital, he was dealt his second blow: a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia at an abnormally young age — people are typically diagnosed around age 69.
His hospital stay in 2011 proved life-changing, and not just because it was then that Franke found out he had leukemia. It also marked his first meeting with his future husband, Ingo, a schoolteacher from Dusseldorf.
""We chatted online, and he came to visit,"" Franke said. ""He didn't care about the HIV. He didn't care about the problem with my blood. He didn't care about my sickness. He cared about me as a human being.""
Franke said the prospect of a future relationship with Ingo — the ""power of love,"" as he called it — kept him going that winter, despite his double diagnosis.
""I had to look good when Ingo came to visit,"" said Franke. ""The doctors were saying, with the HIV and the chemotherapy for leukemia, 'Marc, you must be feeling horrible.' But I wasn't. I knew I wanted to live with him and that's what got me through it all.""
After undergoing chemotherapy, Franke went into remission, but relapsed just one year later, in August 2012. The leukemia started spreading aggressively in his body, leaving him with few options for treatment. The only possibility left was a stem cell transplant, an invasive procedure only recommended to some patients with certain types of deadly cancers — like leukemia — that haven't responded to chemotherapy.
The doctors were keen to try the treatment on Franke. They knew of other cases when transplants of this sort — using stem cell donations from people with a specific genetic mutation that means they lack what is called the ""CCR5-Delta 32 receptor"" — had ""healed"" HIV patients, and wanted to see if the same could work for him.
Timothy Ray Brown, who was known as the ""Berlin patient"", was the first person to be healed of HIV using this method. His cure was announced in 2008. Adam Castillejo, the ""London patient,"" became the second. His cure was announced in 2019. Two others are considered ""possibly"" cured of the virus.
People with the CCR5-Delta mutation are essentially immune to HIV, because the virus has to dock onto the CCR5 receptor in order to live in the body. Without the receptor, the virus cannot survive.
The doctors started looking for a donor. 
Fortunately, they were able to locate one with the mutation quickly —  former flight attendant Anja Prause, also from the west German region North Rhine Westphalia.  The transplant using Prause's bone marrow took place on Valentine's Day in February 2013, and would cure Franke of HIV. But it would be years until either of them would find out it had worked.
Stem cell transplants for leukemia patients like Franke work like this: First, intensive chemotherapy essentially wipes out the patient's old immune system.
Then doctors facilitate the stem cell transplant, inserting the donor's cells into the patient's bloodstream. If everything goes right, these cells will find the patient's bone marrow and start producing new, altered blood cells.
It's a high-risk procedure that ends in death up to 15% of the time, doctors say. Because this treatment can only ethically be offered to patients like Franke who need a stem cell transplant in order to survive, cancer-free HIV patients aren't eligible.
""The people are at very high risk of infections, of bleeding and so on and so on,"" said Björn Jensen, Franke's doctor. ""And this is why people die from this procedure and this is why you can't just use it for, you know, diseases that are not deadly. Even if they would be willing to take that risk, it's just unethical from a physician's point of view to take a risk of killing somebody with 15% probability when you have combination antiretroviral therapy.""
With the seeming ubiquity of antiretroviral therapies in the developed world — which, if taken daily, can render a person's HIV more or less void — one may wonder whether an HIV cure is even worth it at this point.
Interviews with HIV-positive patients show it is.
""I've been living with HIV for the past 15 years,"" Patrick McGregor, an HIV patient from South Africa, told DW. ""Finding a cure will be imperative for us to prevent unnecessary death for our brothers and sisters because HIV still kills a lot of people, particularly in our country, and in my province in South Africa. Many of my comrades that I know have defaulted on treatment and then they end up dying.""
Studies show that, globally, 25% of people with HIV aren't taking ART medications because they don't have access to them. This doesn't include the many who merely forget to take their pills, which can cause complications.
So if stem cell transplants won't ever offer a scalable cure, what will? Doctors are looking at other ways to cure HIV through the modification of patients' CCR5 receptors, proteins on the surfaces of white blood cells, through genetic modification — without wiping out their entire immune system.
Monique Nijhuis, who researches HIV cures at the AI System headquarters in Utrecht in the Netherlands, which oversees patients who have undergone procedures like Franke's, said scientists have already successfully facilitated what it takes to ""cure"" HIV in lab settings.
""I can very easily cure cells infected with HIV using these different techniques,"" she told DW. ""The thing is that we have to translate this to an individual with HIV in a way that is not harming the individual with HIV.""
Although genetic modification isn't as risky as stem cell transplants, in order to offer the therapy at a population level, scientists need to make sure that the ""scissors"" involved in the therapy only cut out the intended receptor, CCR5, and nothing else, Nijhuis said.
""I'm not really 100% sure whether these scissors that we have trained so much in the lab to recognize CCR5 are not by mistake are also recognizing something else,"" she said. ""Because that would be harmful if those scissors would go and go and react against CCR2 or any other chemokine receptor.""
More research has to be done to ensure the scissors only cut out the one specific reactor, CCR5, and not reactors essential to people's health. There are research institutes currently doing this work, like Tulane University in the US state of Louisiana, as well as US-based company American Gene Technologies, which is about to publish phase one clinical trials on human beings.
Two years after Franke received the stem cell transplant, he met Prause. The contact between the two started with a letter from Prause, who'd been informed by doctors that everything had gone well with Franke.
""Hello, you,"" she wrote. ""I guess with us being pretty much a bullseye in genetic terms, I think I can use the informal pronoun ‘du' here. We're almost family. From what I've been able to hear, you are doing better. It will, of course, be a long way to full recovery. But I am overjoyed that you have successfully taken on my transplanted cells. My thoughts are with you often. I close my eyes for a short moment and hope to hear from you soon that you are okay. With love from all my heart.""
A few years later, in 2018, Franke discontinued his use of antiretroviral therapy for HIV under medical supervision. He continued testing for the virus twice a week — he still tests now, but only once every two months.
""When people call Dr. Jensen a healer, he's still very careful with the term 'cure,'"" said Franke. ""But when he writes an article in Nature Medicine about how I've been cured of HIV, I think that's all the proof I need.""

https://www.dw.com/en/most-wuthering-heights-day-ever-as-kate-bush-turns-65/a-66376134,MUSIC,'⁠Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever' as Kate Bush turns 65 30.07.2023,"If this weekend you encounter a group of people all dressed in red and attempting a synchronized choreography to Kate Bush's debut single from 1978, ""Wuthering Heights,"" chances are it's not performance art or a religious cult, but an expression of love for the iconic British singer, who turns 65 on July 30. 
Launched in 2016, ""The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever,"" is an annual event held in cities around the world. From Melbourne to Dublin via Amsterdam and Cologne, to name but a few, people attempt to recreate the dance moves from one of the two music videos made for the song, along with Bush's costume of red dress and tights, accented with a black scarf around her waist.
The fact that most of the people who take part in the event weren't even born when the song was released is testament to Bush's enduring appeal. That also got a huge boost last year, when her 1985 hit ""Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)"" landed back in the charts again, thanks to being used in a pivotal scene in Season 4 of the hit Netflix series ""Stranger Things."" That led to a whole new generation discovering the legendary artist.
Kate Bush was just 19 years old when ""Wuthering Heights,"" inspired by the Emily Bronte novel of the same name, was released and became an immediate smash hit. Despite Bush's eclectic musical style and eccentric aesthetics, and her fondness for lyrics based on obscure or esoteric subjects, she landed hit after hit through the 1980s and into the '90s, before taking a 12-year break to focus on her family.

Her innovative approach extended to technology, as she became the first musician to have a wireless headset microphone made for her. This allowed her to sing while also using her arms to dance — a technology that's now standard for many live performers.
Bush continues to release new work and has even played live in recent years. And in 2014, she became the first woman to have eight albums in the UK charts at the same time. She remains hugely influential for many other artists, with Icelandic singer Björk calling her ""Mother"" earlier this month in Interview magazine. 
Björk has also spoken critically of the sexist way the mainstream music media tended to write about Bush in past decades, dismissing her as a ""crazy witch"" in an interview with NME. That ignorance may have come from an inability to accept the very qualities that have made Kate Bush so beloved by her fans: a certain iconoclasm and a fierce adherence to her own artistic vision — and the fact that, as one fan put it in a New York Times article about an annual tribute event in Philadelphia, ""The tone of the show, like Kate's work, is a mix of deeply earnest and really, really silly.""
That fusion of sincerity and lightheartedness also characterizes ""The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever,"" as Kate Bush fans everywhere celebrate this enigmatic and innovative artist.

https://www.dw.com/en/paris-olympics-seine-booksellers-furious-over-order-to-move/a-66385781,SOCIETY,Paris Olympics: Seine booksellers furious over order to move 29.07.2023,"Open-air booksellers along the banks of the Seine reacted angrily to local authorities informing them they pose a security threat for the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics and that their stands will have to be removed for the sporting spectacle.
The main thrust of the threat, according to police, pertains to the games' July 26 opening ceremonies, which for the first time will be staged outside a stadium.
Some 600,000 people are expected to attend the ceremony and police informed booksellers in a letter that those inside a so-called perimeter of protection would have to be removed for ""obvious security reasons.""
The French government says it will deploy 35,000 police and military for the public ceremony.
Some 570 of the famous stalls — roughly 60% — will be affected. 
""People come to see us like they come to see the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame, [but] they want to hide us during a ceremony that is supposed to represent Paris,"" said Jerome Callais, president of the Paris booksellers' association.
Callais said most booksellers had, ""no intention of moving,"" exclaiming: ""We're a symbol of Paris. We've been here for 450 years.""
With a total length of three kilometers (1.86 miles), booksellers' green wooden boxes comprise Europe's largest open-air book market, with second-hand book and art booths extending from Pont Marie to Quai du Louvre on the Right Bank, and from Quai de la Tournelle to Quai Voltaire on the Left Bank.
City authorities say they will pay to have the booths, which are affixed to railings along the river, removed and later reinstalled, as well as covering the cost of ""renovation"" for any damage that may occur during that process.
The banks where the stalls are installed were declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1991, and the booksellers are seeking ""intangible cultural heritage"" status, something city authorities say would be aided by the renovations being offered.
Still, booksellers are unhappy as they worry their stalls may be damaged.
""They are very fragile… our stalls will not be able to withstand this operation, nor will the morale of the booksellers,"" said Albert Abid, who has been selling books out of a 100-year-old stall for more than 10 years.
Association President Callais agrees, and estimates the total cost of such renovations would cost roughly €1.5 milion ($1.66 million).
He also scoffed at the city's plan to offer set up shop at an alternative venue in a ""literary neighborhood near the Siene for the duration of the games,"" saying of the proposed site for a ""bookseller village"" at Place de la Bastille — ""no one is going to go to that market.""

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-and-speed-an-exhibition-on-a-special-relationship/a-66372493,CULTURE,Germany and speed: An exhibition on a special relationship 29.07.2023,"Germany is synonymous with speed . From autobahns to automats (vending machines), Germans have no time to waste.
Even the language tells you they don't have time for excess: Verschlimmbesserung (which is when you try to improve something, with good intentions, but actually end up making it worse). Why use 16 words when one will do?
And in 1886 when Carl Benz applied for a patent for his ""vehicle powered by a gas engine,"" the German entrepreneur began a reputation that has only gathered pace since, with almost one million people employed within the car industry across Europe's largest economy.
Now, in all its forms, the concept of speed — or ""tempo"" in the German language — is being expanded upon via artworks in exhibitions running concurrently under the title ""Tempo. Tempo! Tempo?"" across three museums in central Germany.

The perspectives are showcased through three different lenses at a contemporary art museum, a historical museum and a technical museum respectively, with each presenting overlapping, individual exhibitions on the topic of speed.
The exhibition was one year in the making, the spokesperson for the PS. Speicher Museum in Einbeck, Stephan Richter, told DW.
""The inspiration came between the CEO of our museum — Lothar Meyer-Mertel — and the manager of the museum in Hannover — Professor Doctor Katja Lembke,"" Richter says. ""The two of them wanted to do an exhibition together, and with a third museum. Each museum looks at the topic of speed from their specific point of view. In PS Speicher we look at it from the technological side, the Kunst Museum in Derneburg from the art point of view, and the museum in Hannover from the viewpoint of archaeology and ethnology, with the history of speed and what it has meant for mankind.""
Even the title has three viewpoints at its heart, with the use of the full stop, the exclamation mark and the question mark, illustrating the different angles of the exhibition, Richter explains.
Across the trilogy of exhibitions, speed is explored from both outside and inside the box. Meaning, cars and motorbikes, of course. A hare too. But also in art form, looking at evolutionary theory and new media, as the race from A to B shows no signs of easing up.
The Art Museum in the Derneburg Castle, for instance, is presenting contemporary works by artists in the fields of sculpture, painting, installation and new media, who explore the concept of speed from angles such as evolutionary theory and technology.
The Landesmuseum in Hannover, meanwhile, looks at speed from a perspective of natural and cultural history. Finally, the exhibition in Einbeck focuses mainly on technical aspects of speed.
Upon arrival in Einbeck, you are struck immediately by the ""eye-catching"" Lockheed F-104 Starfighter jet from the United States, which had the capability to reach twice the speed of sound.
Also on display is a Bugatti Veyron which in 2010 set a land speed record of 431, 072 km per hour (268 mph).
The German theme is apparent throughout the museum with the more obvious examples of a Volkswagen Nardo and a BMW motorcycle, to the more surprising example of what is believed to be the first speeding ticket issued in Germany.
""It's just a piece of paper,"" Richter explains. ""But it's the oldest traffic ticket in Germany, a warning about speed from 1894. You can see it in our exhibition for the first time. In those days, there were no street signs or ways of measuring speed. But the vehicle drove nearly 30 kilometers per hour, so not really fast. But the story goes that it drove nearby a restaurant and caused the curtains to flutter, indicating that it was going too fast.""
But the exhibitions are not exclusively about Germany's relationship with speed. Pictures of highways in California, artwork from Bahrain, a Shuttle Ejection Escape Suit from NASA, and a kangaroo from Australia, are all prominent features across the trio of displays, with even a reindeer sleigh from Lapland on display.
Tempo. Tempo! Tempo? began in June and will run through February 4, 2024, in Hannover, Derneburg and Einbeck, all located within the state of Lower Saxony.

https://www.dw.com/en/why-latin-should-not-become-extinct-in-school/a-66373904,CULTURE,Why Latin should not become extinct in school 28.07.2023,"Competence in foreign languages is becoming increasingly important in a globalized world. While many are keen to learn French and Spanish, given their prominence in today's society, students at secondary schools still have the option to learn Latin, even though its often referred to as a ""dead"" language given that there are no native speakers. We don't even know how it sounded because it died out long before its tones were ever recorded.
In Germany, interest in Latin has been declining nationwide. Whereas in 2008 more than 830,000 young people throughout Germany were still learning the Indo-European language at school, by 2021/22 that figure had dropped to 539,000. In comparison, French is almost three times as popular.
Professor Stefan Freund is chairman of the German Association of Classical Philologists (DAV), the professional association for Latin and Greek at schools and universities, and teaches Latin at the University of Wuppertal.
Deutsche Welle spoke to the professor about Latin and its future within German education.
DW: Is Latin a ""dead"" language?
SF: Latin is a living look into the past and into the functioning of language.
What is the argument for still learning Latin today?
Latin teaching imparts meta-competencies that can be applied throughout life to dealing with and learning other foreign languages, and in substance do not become obsolete. While modern foreign language instruction focuses on communication, Latin instruction focuses on language reflection, such as how it is different from German, how a sentence works, how words changed, and how certain statements are formulated in certain situations.
And, of course, Latin is the common mother of the Romance language family (French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian) and the origin of numerous English words, for instance language, computer and artificial intelligence.
Do students choose Latin instead of, for example, French or Spanish, at the insistence of their parents, or because they already have a particular field of study in mind?
One can only speculate about the students' motives. Four points are likely to be relevant: A general interest in history and mythology and an approach to language more through reflection and analysis than through direct communication. In addition, a study or career perspective for which Latin seems useful and the teachers, who are on average quite young, know how critically the public, parents and the students view their subject and therefore attach great importance to appealing teaching that has nothing to do with the selective drill from the cliche images.
For which courses of study and professions in Germany is Latin useful or even a prerequisite?
What Latin is required for varies. It tends to happen less frequently than it used to. In any case, it is useful for many subjects: History, philosophy, theology, Roman studies, law (Roman law), medicine (history of medicine, terminology), pharmacy (terminology), linguistics, all disciplines that deal with the time before about 1750 and the European area... History of Music, History of Art, History of Science, Church history, local history.
Latin died out around the 7th or 8th century but when did its significance wane?
Until the 18th century, Latin was the most common language in which newly published books were printed. Huge stores of knowledge on all sorts of issues are accessible thanks to my knowledge of Latin, since only a tiny part of this neo-Latin text is translated.

https://www.dw.com/en/czech-tycoon-kretinsky-eyes-german-steel-and-big-subsidies/a-66357204,BUSINESS,Czech tycoon Kretinsky eyes German steel and big subsidies 28.07.2023,"The energy crisis helped the owner of Czech energy holding Energeticky Prumyslovy (EPH) post a record profit ­­of €4.6 billion ($5.09 billion) in 2022. Reports suggest that the Czech billionaire might use those funds to buy the steel unit of Germany's industrial giant ThyssenKrupp.
That has many, not for the first time, asking: who is Kretinsky, anyways?
On the surface, at least, the taciturn 48-year-old seems a contrast to the older, rather gruff and arrogant generation of Czech oligarchs that emerged in the post-communist years.
Suave and cosmopolitan, on the rare occasions he talks to the media Kretinsky likes to focus on his art collection, and do so while sipping green tea.
Acquisitions across Europe have given him an international profile the likes of which few Central European business magnates have achieved.
Jerome Lefilliatre, a media and business reporter who wrote a biography of Kretinsky in 2019, described him as ""extremely intelligent, very ambitious, very determined, and very opportunistic — the perfect businessman,"" in an interview for French daily Le Monde in 2020.
But there is suspicion that Kretinsky's remarkable — and largely unexplained — rise to Czechia's second-richest person with a fortune of $9.4 billion (€8.49 billion), in fact relied heavily on the same networks as those earlier, unreconstructed tycoons.
Indeed, looking closer, the mask can slip, with the billionaire's words often at odds with his actions.
""To the extent that our results were due to the Russian invasion, I do not celebrate them,"" Kretinsky told the Czech edition of Forbes Magazine in April as he discussed EPH's bumper year.""
At its core, Kretinsky's empire, which has an estimated value of over €9 billion, is also deeply old fashioned. EPH is built on coal and a simple bet against Europe's energy transition.
When Slovak oligarch group J&T and PPF — an investment vehicle owned by Czech oligarch Petr Kellner before he died in 2021 — founded EPH in 2009, Kretinsky became chairman and a 20% shareholder, pitching him into partnership with the top privatization barons of the post-communist era.
By 2014 he had full control and was building out EPH using Slovak pipeline operator Eustream — then the main carrier of Russian gas imports to Europe — as a cash cow on which he could leverage debt.
A feverish acquisition drive followed, as cut-price coal-based assets were bought from European energy giants keen to clean up their portfolios.
A key deal was the 2016 capture by LEAG — a partnership with PPF — of a German lignite mine and power plants from Swedish state giant Vattenfall.
But the real kicker was Germany's decision to phase out coal from power production by 2038. The government in Berlin has agreed to pay €1.75 billion to have LEAG shutter four power plants slightly ahead of schedule, with further payments for other units to be kept as a back-up during the switch to renewable energy.
Now Germany's second-largest coal miner, EPH has gone on to buy ageing coal-based assets in seven other European countries, and controls strategic portions of the national networks of Italy and the UK.
""Most investors need to stress some sort of long-term horizon, but Kretinsky ditched that idea,"" says Jan Osicka from Masaryk University in Brno, Kretinsky's home town. ""With hindsight there was clearly space for someone to make this bet on slower decarbonisation. The key for EPH was the scale,"" he told DW
However, Kretinsky hasn't kept all his eggs in one basket, spending recent years shopping enthusiastically in Western Europe.
Significant stakes have been acquired in supermarket chains in the UK, France and Germany. On Friday, embattled French retail giant Casino said Kretinsky was one of two candidates in the running to buy the debt-laden grocery chain. Stakes have also been taken in postal services in the UK and Netherlands.
Having previously joined a trend that sees the Czech media landscape being bought out by oligarchs seeking political clout, Kretinsky has sought to replicate the trick in France. But journalists at Le Monde blocked his attempt to secure control of France's newspaper of record, proclaiming commitment to an independent press.
In addition, Ukraine labelled German wholesale giant Metro a sponsor of war, claiming that ""key shareholder [Kretinsky]… is closely linked to the oil, gas and banking sectors of Russia's economy.""

Following these adventures, ThyssenKrupp Steel looks like a deal straight out of Kretinsky's old playbook.
An EPH spokesman failed to respond when asked if the billionaire is interested, but the carbon-heavy industrial giant is unlikely to be expensive. ThyssenKrupp has been trying to offload its steel business for some months — and it looks set for a subsidies bonanza.
Following huge worker protests, German Economy Minister Robert Habeck promised in June to do whatever it takes to help decarbonize the steel industry in order to preserve it. Berlin has readied €2 billion in support for a planned ""green"" steel plant running on hydrogen.   
In that climate, Kretinsky may fancy his chances of securing further support to keep the presses running, while EPH's nearby coal assets would likely happily supply energy.
""Kretinsky's assumption that government's would have to keep his energy assets afloat turned out correct, and you could make similar assumptions regarding ThyssenKrupp,"" said Osicka. ""The German government has made it clear it won't allow these key industries to fall, and it's guaranteed that huge sums will be pumped into modernization.""

https://www.dw.com/en/generative-ai-inventing-proteins-is-changing-medicine/a-66356415,SCIENCE,Generative-AI inventing proteins is changing medicine 27.07.2023,"Back in 2021, artificial intelligence solved a mystery that had been slowing the progress of science for almost a century: how to figure out a protein's structure from its amino acid sequence.
The scientific roadblock, called the ""protein folding problem,"" was solved by AlphaFold, an AI tool from Google's DeepMind laboratory.
Proteins are the building blocks of life — literally, everything that happens in life or nature as a whole depends on proteins. They include antibodies that fight illnesses, hemoglobin that carries oxygen in red blood cells, and enzymes.
A protein's structure is crucial for its function. It's the structure of hemoglobin that helps it carry oxygen in red blood cells, and the structure of enzymes, like amylase, that helps them chew up starches to make sugars.
""You're working in the dark if you don't know what the protein looks like. If you want to modify a protein, like with a drug, it's much clearer when you have the structure,"" said Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool, a research scientist at DeepMind who was part of the team that created AlphaFold.
AlphaFold accurately predicts the folded shape of proteins from amino acid sequences. You can feed it any sequence of amino acids and it pops out the protein shape instantly.
Tunyasuvunakool said AlphaFold has made a huge impact on science, accelerating research in every field of biology, as well as other technology sectors.
It has been used to develop malaria vaccines and drugs to treat cancer, develop plastic-digesting enzymes and design proteins that can convert sunlight into fuel with high efficiency.
AlphaFold's usage speaks volumes for its popularity among scientists. Two years on, the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database has been used by more than 1.2 million researchers around the world. 
AlphaFold was just the beginning of our using AI with proteins. Since then, scientists have got even more creative.
Mohammed AlQuraishi, a molecular biologist and AI expert at Columbia University in the US, has taken the idea behind AlphaFold to the next level — if you can solve the problem of protein folding, why not create entirely new proteins?
AlQuraishi came up with Genie, a generative AI model of protein design that uses digital art techniques to create custom proteins. The result is a tool that can dream up entirely new proteins that have never existed before in nature.
Genie was released in July 2023 in a pre-print study (not yet peer-reviewed) and is one of two similar AI tools presented in 2023 by other research groups.
Genie was repurposed from AlphaFold, essentially merging its capabilities with generative art image programs, like MidJourney.
AlQuraishi and his team trained Genie with data about the charges and structures of amino acids, and how they interact to form proteins.
""It's like if you're trying to make pictures of people [with AI programs]. You give it lots and lots of examples of faces. Initially it picks out high level features like shape, but then learns finer features like hair and 'faceness.' After learning the features of faceness, it can eventually generate new faces,"" said AlQuraishi.
It's the same concept with protein design, continued AlQuraishi — Genie first learns simple features of proteins, then generates precise atomic placements to form new proteins.
But like AI-generated faces, Genie creates proteins that have never existed in nature. They are completely made up.
Tunyasuvunakool said generative AI tools like Genie could be a major boon for scientific progress.
AI generative protein design tools help by linking the role of a protein's structure with its function. For example, it can help scientists understand how the buildup of Tau plaques in neurons (protein fragments in the brain) contribute to Alzheimer's disease. 
""Another example is understanding basic questions of evolution. AI can shed light on how protein structures evolved over 4 billion years,"" said AlQuraishi.
The second benefit is in medical science. Say you want to design a molecule to treat a disease, such as designing a molecule that breaks down those Tau plaques to cure Alzheimer's.
""When you're designing a drug, it's very helpful to know the structure of the protein you're targeting. It tells us how the drug binds to protein targets and how it behaves during the interaction,"" said AlQuraishi.
AlQuraishi described himself as feeling ""very bullish"" that AI tools will transform medical science, but also said he thinks that more immediate benefits will be seen in energy, the environment, or agricultural sectors.
""We could design new enzymes that help break down pollutants or plastics. It's here I think we'll see a quicker impact rather than medical science because the regulation is lighter,"" said AlQuraishi.
There's one fundamental problem with AI protein structure tools, including  AlphaFold and Genie: they only design proteins that are static and rigid.
Real proteins — those found in nature — don't work that way. Real proteins can change shape and adapt to different contexts.
Take, for example, proteins on the surface of neurons, called ion channels, open and close like gates to let sodium and potassium in or out of the cell. 
""We can't design that right now, it's something that remains beyond the realm of existing AI tools, including ours. This is the next frontier and what we're working to solve next,"" said AlQuraishi.
But the joy of AI is you can go back and train it to learn new things. Real world data can be fed back into the AI, such as how a new protein-based drug is metabolized and functions in the body, or how efficient a plastic-eating enzyme works in a recycling plant. The AI can relearn how protein structures impact their function in the real world.

https://www.dw.com/en/odesa-damaged-cultural-sites-of-universal-importance/a-66332353,CULTURE,Odesa: Damaged cultural sites of 'universal importance' 25.07.2023,"In January this year, UNESCO had not only declared the historic center of the Ukrainian port city of Odesa a World Heritage Site, but also added it to the list of endangered human heritage. The aim was to save and protect foreign culture from destruction during the Russian war. The renewed Russian attack on the port city has caused great indignation at UNESCO. In an interview with DW, Lutz Möller, deputy secretary general of the German UNESCO commission, stresses that the sites are of ""universal significance.""
In the buffer zone in the Old Town, which is supposed to be protected, several museums were attacked and damaged. He said that the Archaeological Museum, the Maritime Museum and the Literary Museum were especially affected. 
""The Archaeological Museum and the Literature Museum are right next to each other, while the Maritime Museum is located at the harbor,"" Möller said, adding that all three suffered damage. ""Unfortunately, we don't yet have comprehensive knowledge of whether the collection they hold are lost forever, because the inventory has not yet been completed."" Möller does not believe that museum employees were injured or killed.

Other cultural sites on the outskirts of the Old City, such as the Transfiguration Cathedral, founded in 1794, are also said to have been damaged. Images of collapsed domes and roofs, as well as a destroyed altar and icons inside, have been circulating online.
""You don't have to be an expert to see that the structural integrity of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church is severely compromised,"" Möller said. The Transfiguration Cathedral had already been destroyed in 1936 on Joseph Stalin's orders and rebuilt in 1999 as close to the original as possible. Catherine the Great, founder of Odesa, once ordered the church to be built and dedicated it to the Transfiguration of Christ. The church was visited by the Russian Patriarch Kirill as recently as 2010.
The attack on Odesa is the second time that a world heritage city has been shelled during Russia's war on Ukraine. Just two weeks ago, Lviv was hit by missiles.
""It is an obligation not only for Ukraine to preserve these sites, but for the whole world,” Möller emphasized. ""UNESCO protects them not only because of the importance for the national identity of Ukraine. Indeed, the sites exceed the significance of a single state.""

Several thousand monuments considered significant from UNESCO's and Ukraine's point of view have been marked with a white and blue shield for the protection of cultural property in armed conflicts. ""We would like to secure these sites with the white and blue shield so that they are not shelled,"" Möller said.
Since the start of the Russian invasion on February 24, 2022, 270 incidents causing damage to Ukrainian cultural sites have been recorded, as well as to 3,500 educational institutions, such as schools or libraries.
UNESCO has pledged support either in the form of personnel or financial assistance for reconstruction, the UN cultural body says.
""One possibility is that reconstruction is done under the coordination of UNESCO, depending on the degree of damage. It may also be enough to raise money to help Ukraine rebuild,"" Möller said.
The latest attack on culture in Odesa coincides with the destruction of the Cultural Center for Folk Art and Art Education in the city of Mykolaiv, just over 100 kilometers (62 miles) away.

German Culture Minister Claudia Roth said that Russia's ""targeted attacks on the museums in Odesa show once again this war is an attack on all areas of Ukrainian society and democracy,"" with a particular focus on ""their independent culture.""
In addition, by bombing the World Heritage Old Town of Odesa, Russia is ""directly attacking a significant part of the cultural heritage of humanity,"" Roth continued. ""This criminal violence against the people of Ukraine, as well as their cultural assets, must end and be stopped immediately by Russia.""
She added that the German government continues to stand firmly by the people of Ukraine and their culture.

https://www.dw.com/en/bayreuth-festival-richard-wagners-work-gets-3d-effect/a-66326784,THEATER,Bayreuth Festival: Richard Wagner's work gets 3D effect 24.07.2023,"Bayreuth Festival director, Katharina Wagner, is moving with the times. In the new production of Richard Wagner's opera ""Parsifal,"" US theater director Jay Scheib is working with augmented reality, bringingthe Richard Wagner Festivalinto the digital age.
With the help of virtual technology and special 3D glasses distributed to the audience, digital avatars move through the space and objects fly around the audience's ears. A novelty at the Bayreuth Festival in southern Germany, and in the traditional opera world. Meanwhile on stage, as always, the real singers perform.
Augmented reality means ""extended reality"" and enables immersion into virtual 3D worlds. Unlike ""virtual reality,"" one does not move in a purely digitally constructed environment, but also sees the auditorium and the stage through 3D glasses overlaid with digital images and effects.
""We're going to break down walls,"" vows director and performance artist Jay Scheib in an interview with the German news agency dpa. Scheib's musical production ""Bat out of Hell"" — based on the 1970s album of the same name by hard rocker Meat Loaf — is currently still touring Germany. Meat Loaf alluded to symbols from Wagner's operas both on the album cover and in the music.
Festival director Katharina Wagner also wants to use the new project to attract interested newcomers and, above all, a younger audience to the time-honored festival. And virtual reality specialist Jay Scheib is always good for a surprise. He had already realized a virtual excerpt from Wagner's opera ""Siegfried"" in Bayreuth in 2021.
He chose the famous dragon scene, where you could kill the dragon yourself with Siegfried's sword through 3D glasses. Speaking to DW back then, Scheib had said: ""The part where Siegfried hits Fafner (the dragon) right in the heart was important to me, because we're living in a time where we have to defeat a lot of dragons right now — like Donald Trump.""
The opera ""Parsifal"" is the last musical drama by Richard Wagner, composed especially for the Festspielhaus. ""It is his 'farewell to the world', as Wagner himself called it. Wagner died six months after he wrote the work,"" Sven Friedrich, director of the Richard Wagner Museum in Bayreuth, told DW.
Friedrich will introduce the audience to the work at the festival, but isn't revealing much just yet. Jay Scheib is also keeping a low profile. The director, who is also a professor of music and theatre arts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told the daily Frankfurter Rundschau: ""I don't know if you approach it differently as an American. For me, maybe it's not a religious issue. But 'Parsifal' is a symbol of Bayreuth, it's Wagner's church: and yet I say to myself, 'Let's get the party started'.""
There will be a big musical ""party"" at the open-air event on the eve of the premiere. The opera singers from the various productions will be there. The audience can follow the spectacle on chairs and picnic blankets on the large lawn of the ""Grüner Hügel"" (Green Hill).
Markus Poscher will conduct the festival orchestra with music that also, as the program overview highlights, ""breaks boundaries entirely in the spirit of Wagner."" Composers such as Dmitri Shostakovich, Alban Berg and Giuseppe Verdi, as well as Aerosmith are listed on the program.
A controversial production of Wagner's opera ""Der Ring des Nibelungen,"" directed by Austrian director Valentin Schwarz, is back on the program this year. Schwarz will stage the four-part Ring cycle as a family drama. The so-called ""Netflix Ring,"" which works with cliffhangers and open questions in the style of television series, left viewers and critics alike puzzled and confused in 2022.
As a utopia of love, German music director Roland Schwab has Wagner's ""Tristan and Isolde"" played out in a spartan futuristic setting. This production also dates from last year.
The ""Flying Dutchman,"" directed by Dmitri Tcherniakov, appears on the program for the third and thus last time, conducted by Oksana Lyniv. In 2021, the Ukrainian was the first woman to take the conductor's podium at the Bayreuth Festival. This year, French conductor and singer Nathalie Stutzmann will join her as the second female conductor. She will conduct Tobias Kratzer's production of Tannhäuser.
Every year, some 60,000 people make the pilgrimage to the ""Green Hill,"" where Richard Wagner inaugurated his festival with the ""Ring of the Nibelung"" in 1876. Of the approximately 1,900 guests, only 330 spectators — prominent visitors who will arrive via the red carpet — can enjoy the digital glasses for ""Parsifal"" because of the high costs.
This year, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and, once again, former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have announced their attendance. Claudia Roth, Minister of State for Culture, will also be present. However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is away on vacation and will probably not attend.

https://www.dw.com/en/twitter-elon-musk-rebrands-platform-to-x/a-66328568,MEDIA,Twitter: Elon Musk rebrands platform to 'X' 24.07.2023,"Social media giant Twitter received a makeover Monday morning, with a new logo replacing the blue bird for an X as part of a wider rebranding that was announced Sunday by owner Elon Musk. 
""And soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds,"" Musk wrote on his account Sunday. Musk on Sunday also changed his profile picture to the company's new logo, a white X on a black background. 
Musk said the logo was ""minimalist art deco"" and that ""X.com"" would now lead to twitter.com. 
Before acquiring Twitter for $44 billion (€39.7 billion) in a messy takeover in October 2022, Musk had said buying the company was part of speeding up his ambition to create an ""everything app"" he calls ""X.""
After buying Twitter, Musk named the parent company X Corporation. The billionaire's rocket development company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp, is commonly known as SpaceX. Musk also founded PayPal in 1999 as a startup called X.com.
Musk said tweets will now be called ""x's,"" in response to a tweet Sunday asking what tweets will be called under ""X.""
Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino, a former NBC advertising executive who joined Twitter in May, wrote on the platform that X would be the ""future state of unlimited interactivity — centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking — creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities.""
The rebranding comes after Musk said earlier this month that Twitter has lost nearly half its advertising revenue since he took over last October.
Mass layoffs, reduced content moderation and rising hate speech and misinformation on the platform since Musk's takeover have contributed to turning away advertisers.  
Allen Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce, told the Associated Press that the rebranding will further alienate Twitter's traditional audience.
""They won't get it,"" he said. ""It's a fitting end to a phenomenal unwinding of an iconic brand and business.""

https://www.dw.com/en/quran-burning-how-much-blasphemy-is-allowed-in-europe/a-66314095,FREEDOM OF SPEECH,Quran burning: How much blasphemy is allowed in Europe? 22.07.2023,"Freedom of expression and media freedom are firmly anchored in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It is considered important for democratic societies to be able to tolerate a variety of opinions, even if these may offend religious sensibilities.
However, this repeatedly raises the question of the extent to which critical or mocking statements about people's religious beliefs are acceptable, and how a society should deal with them. Below is a summary of some of the provocations that have been made against religious communities, and how blasphemy is dealt with in Europe.
The Danish parliament on Thursday approved a law that would ban the burning of the Quran and other religious texts. There had been a spate of incidents earlier this year in which people burned the Quran in public. Freedom of expression in Denmark had long been protected to such an extent that people could burn the Quran without facing legal consequences. Now, though, people who burn holy books could face fines or up to two years in jail.
Danish Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard said that the burning of the Quran  was a ""fundamentally despicable and unfriendly act"" that ""damaged Denmark and its interests."" He said that the country's security was one of the main reasons for the proposed law.
Earlier this year, Denmark raised its terror alert level after the Al Qaeda terror network called for attacks in Denmark and Sweden.
 Artists and intellectuals have warned that the law could have a negative impact on freedom of expression in Denmark. In a petition, they called on the government not to pass it saying that it represents an ""attack"" on art, political freedom of expression and press freedom.
In 2005, there were protests in the Arab world after the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published a series of cartoons on Islam, which were considered offensive by some. The case prompted a debate about freedom of expression, artistic freedom and blasphemy in many countries. 
The Danish prime minister at the time distanced himself from the publication of the cartoons but also pointed out that freedom of the press and freedom of expression were highly valued in Denmark. 
Until 2017, Denmark still had a de facto law against blasphemy. However, there were only a few cases in which it was actually implemented ― before it was abolished altogether. The government says that the new law is not about restricting freedom of expression. 

Apart from Denmark there has been a considerable number of cases of people burning Qurans in Sweden in 2023. One particular incident drew considerable attention: In June, Salwan Momika, an Iraqi man who had fled to Sweden,stomped on pages of the Quran and also set fire to the book in front of the main mosque in the capital Stockholm. 
He and other activists had already organized similar actions in the previous months, triggering outrage and violent protests across the country as well as beyond. They also raised tension between Sweden and certain Muslim-majority states. 
While the Swedish government condemned the actions, it also insisted on protecting the freedom of expression and said that it was up to the police whether to allow such a protest to go ahead or not. 
The police, however, has said that though it bears responsibility for authorizing such public actions, it is not responsible for the contents. 
There was an attempt this year to ban such forms of protests and the burning of holy books, but it failed because the right to gather and demonstrate is protected in Sweden. Like in many other Western states, there is no blasphemylaw. 
Momika is currently still under investigation for incitement to hatred. In October 2023, a man was convicted for burning a Quran and bacon on a barbecue, on which there was a sign with a derogatory comment about Prophet Mohammad, in front of the cathedral in Linkoping in 2020. It was the first time that a Swedish court convicted somebody for burning a Quran. For the court, this action targeted Muslims directly and not Islam as a religion. Unlike in Denmark, there are currently no plans to change the law in Sweden. 
But Sweden has also raised its terror alert level, citing the heightened risk of Islamist terrorist attacks. In mid-August, the country was put on level 4 alert on a scale of 1 – 5. 
In Germany, too, freedom of expression is enshrined in the country's Basic Law. Article 5 states that everyone has the right ""freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech, writing and pictures."" There are, however, limits.
Germany is one of the few European countries that protects religious communities with a so-called blasphemy paragraph. Anyone who publicly ""reviles the religion or ideology of others in a manner suited to causing a disturbance of the public peace"" can be sentenced to up to three years in prison. This is not, however, intended to criminalize mockery of God in general, only insults that are detrimental to public peace.
Section 166 of the German Penal Code is very rarely invoked. In 2006, a 61-year-old man was given a suspended prison sentence after distributing rolls of toilet paper with the word "" Quran"" printed on them. And in 2013, an activist was fined for painting her naked torso with the words ""I am God"" and jumping onto the altar of Cologne Cathedral during the Christmas Mass. However, she was only prosecuted for disturbing the practice of religion and was not convicted of blasphemy.
Insulting the Prophet is not usually a case for the courts, and blasphemy is only subject to legal punishment in Germany if it has serious consequences.
In 2015, two Islamists carried out an attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people. Prior to this, the magazine had published cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, which had sparked anger and outrage among Muslims around the world.
A few days after the attack on the magazine's office, France's prime minister, Manuel Valls, appeared before the National Assembly and declared that blasphemy would never be part of French law.
France's president, Emmanuel Macron, has also defended the ""right to blasphemy"" in his country. This means that, in France, freedom of expression includes being allowed to write or say what others consider blasphemy.
Blasphemy has not been an offense in France since 1881. The country has observed the strict separation of church and state for almost 120 years. Historically, this secularism was an attempt to curb the influence of the church in the country. The principle still enjoys a high level of acceptance today among the French population.
Poland is regarded as a very Catholic country, one in which the Church still has a great deal of influence on public life. As in other countries, the Polish constitution also guarantees freedom of expression. However, in recent years, artists in particular have repeatedly been charged with blasphemy.
In 2019, there was an uproar over a Madonna with a halo in the colors of the LGBTQ+ movement. All over the country, people filed criminal complaints with the public prosecutor's office against the three young women who had circulated the image. They were accused of ""offending religious feelings"" by portraying the Madonna in the colors of the rainbow. This is a criminal offense in Poland, punishable by up to two years in prison. The three women were eventually acquitted. The court's verdict was that, although the action was ""provocative,"" they had not intended to offend.
While some countries like Poland and Germany still have paragraphs on blasphemy in their criminal codes, many European countries have already abolished them. These include Ireland, where the paragraph was repealed in 2018; Norway and the Netherlands, along with Sweden, also recently removed similar paragraphs from their codes. The issue has frequently been raised in Germany, with many people calling for the relevant paragraph to be scrapped, in the interests of freedom of expression.

https://www.dw.com/en/hitlers-cultural-accomplices-wagner-speer-and-bechstein/a-66306332,CULTURE,"Hitler's cultural accomplices: Wagner, Speer and Bechstein 22.07.2023","German publisher Hugo Bruckmann and his wife, Elsa, were among the early and highly influential promoters of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. They first officially invited him to their estate in 1924. Their ""literary salon,"" where intellectuals of various religions and opinions had met for intellectual exchange before World War I, was frequented in the 1920s primarily by German nationalists who railed against democracy and the Weimar Republic.
Among them was Hitler's later star architect, Albert Speer, but also the married couple Winifred and Siegfried Wagner, who organized the famous Bayreuth Festival in celebration of German composer Richard Wagner. Elsa Bruckmann provided a forum for all those who mourned Germany's imperial era and suffered from the economic crisis or the ""ignominy"" of the lost First World War.
""The longing for a messiah was great, and the hopes of the upper middle classes were pinned on Hitler,"" explains Sven Friedrich, director of the Richard Wagner Museum in Bayreuth. Hitler had inspired Elsa Bruckmann and many others with his indoctrinating speeches and his visions of a new great Germany. The couple provided financial support to the leader of the National Socialist Party (NSDAP), and Elsa Bruckmann took pleasure in dressing him appropriately. Through her, Hitler also established crucial connections with prominent industrialists.
Adolf Hitler felt comfortable in these circles. ""After all, he had not received any significant education and had barely managed to make a living as an art and postcard painter in Vienna. He lacked a proper upbringing and background; he had to acquire everything on his own,"" Sven Friedrich elaborates.
Winifred Wagner, the daughter-in-law of composer Richard Wagner, was also one of Hitler's supporters. ""Winifred was enthralled by Hitler due to his sense of mission and his profound admiration for Wagner's music,"" says Friedrich. From the very beginning, he had promised her that he would take care of the Bayreuth Festival once he had power in Germany.
A friendship quickly developed between the two. At times, Adolf Hitler lived with the Wagners at their estate. A prominent member of the family was also Houston Stewart Chamberlain, an influential British-German race theorist, antisemite and a mastermind of the National Socialist movement. He was married to Richard Wagner's daughter, Eva. ""For Hitler, Chamberlain was an idol,"" says Friedrich.
In 1923, the National Socialists, led by Adolf Hitler, made an unsuccessful attempt to violently overthrow the government of the Weimar Republic in Munich. As a consequence of this failed coup, Hitler was sentenced to five years in prison. He began serving his sentence in the spring of 1924 at Landsberg Fortress and was granted early release later the same year.
""This imprisonment at Landsberg Fortress was more of a house arrest, where one lived comfortably with like-minded comrades,"" Friedrich points out. The Wagners are not to be found on the visitors' list, but they kept up a lively correspondence with Hitler. Winifred Wagner sent him sweets and writing paper. It was on this paper that Hitler wrote his book ""Mein Kampf."" Elsa Bruckmann later offered to be the editor for the second edition.
Alongside Elsa Bruckmann, the names of Helene and Edwin Bechstein are also on the list of Hitler's visitors in prison. The Bechstein piano company, founded in 1853 by Carl Bechstein, was a well-established German business at the time, and is still one of the biggest piano manufacturers today. ""Until the war, most prominent pianists played on a Bechstein piano or grand piano,"" says Gregor Willmes, a musicologist and cultural manager at the Bechstein company. Inflation in the 1920s hit the company hard.
Edwin, one of Carl's sons, had cashed out early on and had some wealth. He and his wife supported Hitler's plans, and like the Wagners, they also hosted Hitler in their villa.
Once Adolf Hitler gained power, the Bayreuth Festival was under his personal protection because the Wagners had always supported him. ""He reciprocated by granting Bayreuth substantial financial subsidies,"" says museum director Sven Friedrich. The National Socialists ensured that the performances, known as the ""War Festival Performances,"" continued until 1944.
With the start of World War II, Hitler's visits to the upper-class ladies became less frequent. Elsa Bruckmann distanced herself from Hitler because of the atrocities committed on his orders in the persecution of the Jews and in the war. However, she is said to have retained her nationalist sentiments until her death in 1951.
Winifred Wagner remained an ardent supporter of Hitler and National Socialism after the war. She — like her son Wieland, who had stood closely by Hitler's side — had to go through a so-called denazification procedure. She was not allowed to continue in her position as festival director in Bayreuth. She continued to meet with acquaintances from the Nazi era.
Hitler's architect Albert Speer was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Other cultural figures, like sculptor Arno Breker, or conductors Wilhelm Furtwängler and Herbert von Karajan, had cooperated with Hitler, but the Allies eventually classified them as ""fellow travelers"" (""Mitläufer"") and they were able to resume their activities successfully after a time. Breker even created works commissioned by the German government after the war. And conductor Friedrich Furtwängler was celebrated during his tours with the Berlin Philharmonic in Europe. Wieland Wagner, on the other hand, took over management of the Bayreuth Festival together with his brother Wolfgang. They introduced a new aesthetic with lighting effects and sparse stage designs, and Wieland was hailed as a great innovator in stage direction.
Helene and Edwin Bechstein's closeness with Hitler had also damaged the reputation of the piano making company after the war. Nevertheless, they kept the name. ""We carry the name, of course, because of Carl Bechstein, who was an important personality and promoted art and culture, but we are aware of this inglorious history surrounding Helene and Edwin,"" says cultural manager Gregor Willmes. Today, the company works with many Jewish and Palestinian pianists from Israel and supports musical projects that deal with National Socialism. No one from the Bechstein family itself is still with the company. 
The Bayreuth Festival Hall is no longer owned by the Wagner family, but is maintained by the public Richard Wagner Foundation. Today, artistic director Katharina Wagner, granddaughter of Winifred Wagner, has confronted her family's National Socialist past. Her goal from the beginning has been to ""lead the Festival into a modern age.""

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-court-rules-nazi-looted-art-stays-in-database/a-66306098,ARTS,Germany: Court rules Nazi-looted art stays in database 21.07.2023,"The German Court of Justice (BGH) ruled against an art dealer in his attempt to have an entry deleted from a database of artworks potentially looted by Nazi Germany.
The entry of the painting in the Lost Art Database as possibly looted art was based on true facts and did not affect the plaintiff's ownership of the painting, the Karlsruhe-based court ruled Friday. However, presiding Judge Bettina Brückner acknowledged that the collector was in a ""predicament"" as the painting would likely be difficult to sell. According to the ruling, the interests of former owners or their legal successors and the general public's interest outweighed the current owner's interest when it comes to cultural property possibly confiscated by the Nazis.
The plaintiff could choose to attempt legal action in an administrative court against the operator of the Lost Art Database, the German Center for Lost Cultural Property, the presiding judge in Karlsruhe said. The court did not publish the plaintiff's name.
Previously, the man had sued the trustees of a Canadian foundation that had commissioned the search for his artwork, ""Calabrian Coast — Sicilia,"" by the painter Andreas Achenbach (1815-1910).

The painting's provenance is clear: from 1931 to 1937, it belonged to the Jewish art dealer Max Stern, who ran a gallery in Düsseldorf founded by his father. Stern was banned from carrying out his profession in 1935 by the Reich Chamber of Fine Arts, but the order was not initially enforced. In 1937, Stern sold the Achenbach painting to a private individual from Essen. In September 1937, he was forced to give up his gallery, and he emigrated two months later via England to Canada, where he died in 1987. A Canadian trust currently administers his estate. 

The plaintiff had bought the painting at auction in London in 1999, which meant there was no doubt about his rightful ownership. While the work was on exhibition in Baden-Baden in 2016, he learned that it was listed in the Lost Art Database and was being sought by Interpol. 
A settlement between the current owner and the Canadian trust that administered Max Stern's estate fell through. In court, the collector wanted the trustees to stop claiming ownership of the painting. He also wanted the search notice removed. The man indicated he did not want any further criticism of his property. He had previously also failed to have the entry deleted in lower courts.
The Lost Art Database is a publicly-accessible database set up by the German Lost Art Foundation to keep track of artworks looted or expropriated by the Nazis.
The German Center for Lost Cultural Property said it would await the detailed written justification for the ruling before considering any need for action. But it welcomed the ruling itself, and said that, by operating the database, the Center was contributing to Germany's obligation to come to terms with Nazi injustice.

https://www.dw.com/en/kyiv-imposes-ban-on-russian-language-culture/a-66301913,POLITICS,Kyiv imposes ban on Russian-language culture 20.07.2023,"Street musicians singing Russian songs in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv could soon face problems. Likewise, bars and restaurants playing Russian background music may end up getting in trouble.
The reason is that Kyiv city council has issued a temporary ban on performing or showcasing Russian-language art and culture — such as books, music, plays and concerts — in public. This ban also encompasses cultural and educational programs. The restriction not only applies to works by Russian authors and creators, but to all cultural products publicly presented in or translated into Russian.
Ukrainian MPs said the move was designed to protect Ukraine from Russian influence. ""Russia is the language of the aggressor and it has no place in the heart of our capital,"" said Vadym Vasylchuk, the deputy chairman of the Standing Committee on Education and Science, Youth and Sports.
The move is backed by Ukraine's Vidsich (Defense) movement, which began calling for a ban on the Russian language and Russian goods, films and music in 2014, following the annexation of Crimea. ""A ban on Russian-language cultural products is necessary,"" Vidsich activist Kateryna Chepura told DW. ""This is an additional lever for activists working to boycott everything Russian, so we can say: shut it down, remove Russian from public life.""
The Kyiv city council ban, however, is temporary, lending it a symbolic quality only. A permanent, legally binding ban would require support from Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada.
As a result, Chepura calls Kyiv's temporary ban ""an ineffective instrument, because you cannot be held accountable for disregarding it."" She regards it as a ""moral factor encouraging people who do not want to continue tolerating Russian music on the streets or in theater.""
In fact, certain Russian-language cultural products are already prohibited in Ukraine. The bans date back to September 2019, when the first restrictions were imposed in the region of Lviv. Subsequently, other cities like Ternopil and Zhytomyr in the Volhynia region, followed suit.
Human rights activist Volodymyr Yavorskyy of the Ukrainian Center for Civil Liberties, however, said such bans are discriminatory and unconstitutional. ""These are illegal decisions, because local authorities have no right to regulate such issues and impose such bans,"" Yavorskyy told DW. ""That is why they have no legal consequences."" The judiciary, he added, had already deemed such local bans illegal.
A person violating the Kyiv city council moratorium on Russian cultural products cannot be held accountable, Yaworskyy said. ""These bans issued by local authorities are nothing but political gestures — only the Ukrainian parliament can turn such bans into law."" Only then, he said, would they become legally binding and enforceable.
In June 2022, the Ukrainian parliament already banned publicly playing songs by Russian artists. The restriction does not, however, apply to Russian singers who condemn Russia's war against Ukraine. Recently, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also signed a law banning the import and distribution of Russian books. It was passed by parliament last year.
Regardless of whether or not local bans are in place, playing Russian music in public is bound to cause controversy. Take, for instance, a recent disagreement between a 17-year-old busker and Ukrainian MP Natalya Pipa. She complained when the teenager performed songs by Russian rock legend Viktor Tsoi on the street in Lviv, who in return insulted the woman, saying he was allowed to play whatever music he liked. Later, however, the busker published a video in which he apologized to the lawmaker.
Another altercation occurred in the village of Pohreby, in the Kyiv region. There, a young woman was thrown out of a cafe for complaining that the establishment was playing a song by Russian pop singer Grigory Leps supporting Russia's war against Ukraine.
Yevgenia Belorusets, a Ukrainian artist, translator and author who works in Ukrainian Russian and German, says the Russian-language ban is discriminatory. ""These bans perpetuate the myth that Ukrainian culture is always being discriminated against,"" she told DW. ""This then supposedly gives it the right to discriminate against other forms of cultural expression.""
""Ukrainian-language culture knows too well how discrimination feels,"" she added. ""It should not try to overcome this trauma by inflicting similar pain on others."" The creator said Ukraine should not mirror Russian aggressors and refrain from ""projecting Russia's aggressive intentions onto Ukraine's complex cultural situation.""
Belorusets said language bans could divide Ukrainian society, warning that ""it's getting harder and harder to talk about this in Ukraine, because doing so is immediately labeled as a hostile act."" Ukraine's future as a democratic state, she said, depends on granting everyone their rights and accepting their own complicated past. ""The challenge consists in accepting competing views within society.""

https://www.dw.com/en/myanmars-artists-and-the-forgotten-civil-war/a-66286991,ARTS,Myanmar's artists and the forgotten civil war 20.07.2023,"The oil painting that opens the exhibition has a spectacular journey behind it: rolled up and disguised as hand luggage, it was recently smuggled out of Myanmar. Titled ""Bitch better have my democracy,"" it's a striking and colorful work by artist Richie Htet, who painted it soon after Myanmar's military coup in February 2021. ""I wanted to encourage us at that time. There were a lot of images of the atrocities circulating on the Internet. I wanted to create something triumphant,"" Htet tells DW. When he posted it on social media, the image immediately went viral.
Today, the painting is considered an icon of courageous protests against the military dictatorship that have resulted in the deaths of thousands of people and forced some 1.5 million to flee the country. Htet's painting shows the dark-haired beauty Mie Bamar Pyi, a personification of Myanmar, bearing a shield in one hand and a spear in the other. She attacks an Ogre, a demon from Buddhist mythology, who is dressed as a general from Myanmar's military junta. The motif references both Asian and Western icons: it quotes the battle of the Hindu goddess Durga against a demon, while also calling to mind Christian depictions of the Archangel Michael defeating Satan.
For painter Richie Htet, the work represents the collective effort of Myanmar's people to fight the military junta. So for Li Li, co-organizer of the exhibition, ""We Are the Seeds: The Art of Myanmar's Spring Revolution,"" it's a small miracle that this painting can be seen until July 21 at the Open Society Foundation in Berlin. ""If the painting had to be rolled out at airport security when it left the country, our contact probably would have ended up in jail,"" Li Li tells DW.
The exhibition includes works by 18 Myanmar artists, most of whom live in exile in Paris, like co-organizer Li Li and Richie Htet. With the wide-ranging show featuring paintings, installations, sound and video, Li Li wants to draw attention to the civil war that has largely been forgotten in Europe. ""The military already had experience; this is now the third coup. From the past, they knew about the power that can come from artists during protests. That's why they were and are particularly vulnerable.""
The 29-year-old Htet is considered a promising painter in Myanmar's contemporary art scene, which gained international attention following the democratization of the country in 2011. He grew up under the military dictatorship and outed himself as gay at just 14 years old — an act of bravery, since homosexuality, while not illegal in Myanmar, is considered ""unnatural"" in the country. After studying in London, Htet returned to Yangon, where he became the art director of a fashion magazine.
It was a time of awakening and sheer unbridled creativity. Htet began to paint homoerotic images that played with Indian and South Asian mythologies, which, from his point of view, are rich in queer characters. In his first solo exhibition, ""A Chauk"" (a Burmese epithet for homosexual men), he showed women in positions of power and naked men as objects of desire at the gallery Myanm/art in 2020.
The first queer exhibition in Myanmar became a success: all of Htet's paintings sold and he decided to live exclusively from his art. Then, in February 2021, the violent military coup d'etat ended not only his dreams but also Yangon's diverse cultural life. ""I was quite devastated. I felt like the future was sort of ripped away from me, because I was planning on living and working in Yangon. I was planning on making it my home.""
After some of Htet's family members were imprisoned, he saw only one way out: escaping to France with the help of an artist scholarship. ""When I left, my father was super sick at that point, so I knew that when I said goodbye to my father, it was the last time I would see him."" His father died the next year.
The artist and musician Pinky also decided to leave Myanmar in spring 2021. Her bandmate was arrested and his laptop, on which joint protest actions were stored, was confiscated. Pinky Htut Aung waited in Bangkok for several months until she, too, was able to take up a scholarship in Paris. Now, like Richie Htet and Li Li, she can stay permanently as a political refugee.
Pinky is a multifaceted artist. The 31-year-old composes music, paints and works with sound collages. For the Berlin exhibition, she devoted her attention to clouds. ""I've been obsessed with clouds since I was a child. They're very spiritual for me. They never die, and they transform, just like our spirit.""
Her milky, translucent work hangs freely from the ceiling, accompanied by celestial sounds. The clouds are not painted but instead burned into thick translucent paper with the help of a candle. ""I was afraid I would set my small apartment on fire in the process,"" she says. Pinky says she made a conscious decision to experiment with fire for the piece: ""In Paris, of course, I follow the events in Myanmar. On my smartphone, I see something on fire all the time."" 
 
 
""People across the board in Myanmar are afraid,"" says Franz Xaver Augustin, who was able to reopen the Goethe-Institut in Yangon in 2014 after several years of preparation, and served as its director until 2019. ""I experienced Myanmar before it opened in 2011. It was terrible, an atmosphere of fear."" During the period of democratization, the Institute was an important resource for artists, and it remains a refuge for them these days. Augustin has accompanied some of the artists now exhibiting in Berlin from the beginning. At the time, he would not have thought it possible that they would soon have to flee their country.
Richie Htet has been politicized by the military coup. In addition to homoerotic images, his work now deals with the civil war in his country.
The military's tactics have become more brutal during the course of the war — using sexual violence and wiping out entire villages. In addition, decapitated and dismembered bodies have been found, some of which had been disemboweled.
The Berlin exhibition features a disturbing painting by Htet, ""Autopsy of the Irrawaddy,"" depicting a sewn-up corpse. ""I want to show the atrocities the army is committing against the population,"" he says.
Artists like Richie Htet and Pinky initially stood stunned and speechless before these atrocities. They belong to the generation that blossomed with the opening of their country — and whose trust was shaken to the core after another military coup. With their paintings and installations, they have found their voices again. And they will not stop using them to speak out about the civil war on their own terms.

https://www.dw.com/en/bruce-lee-the-kung-fu-legends-legacy-lives-on/a-66176496,FILM,Bruce Lee: The kung fu legend's legacy lives on 18.07.2023,"""Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water."" Kung fu legend Bruce Lee's most famous quote is not simply his advice for would-be martial artists on how to deftly evade opponents. It also represents a philosophical way of approaching the world that still has resonance for his fans.
A book of his philosophical writing, ""Artist of Life"" — which was translated into and published in German for the first time in 2023 as ""Empty Your Mind"" — contains valuable insights into his peace. This aspect of the film star's life is often forgotten in remembering his legacy, half a century on from his untimely death.
He was born as Lee Jun-Fan in San Francisco in 1940 to Grace Ho and Lee Hoi-chuen, who was a famous Cantonese opera singer and film actor.
The future kung fu artist spent most of his childhood in Hong Kong where he was a child actor in several movies.
But soon it was clear that his interest was not limited to acting. He began boxing and dancing as a teenager and trained in Wing Chun, a form of conceptual kung fu, as a way of combining his graceful movements and love of fighting.
Aged 18, he moved to the United States for college, where he also taught martial arts and developed his own early form of mixed martial arts (MMA), Jeet Kune Do.
At the same time, he appeared in several US TV shows and movies, usually in small roles associated with martial arts.
It was not until he returned to Hong Kong that he landed his first leading roles, with Golden Harvest studios. He was at the top of his worldwide fame, when he died unexpectedly of a cerebral edema on July 20, 1973. He was only 32 years old. The last film released during his lifetime was ""Way of the Dragon,"" in 1972, while ""Enter the Dragon"" was completed after his death, in 1973 — both were Hollywood hits.
While Lee's legacy is mainly defined by his superior physical fitness and technical fighting skills, the philosophical tenets that he developed during his short life have received less attention. His own martial art style of Jeet Kune Do sums up the synthesis of these dual parts of his life.
""The techniques and philosophies of Jeet Kune Do can be applied to real combat as well as challenging life situations. Jeet Kune Do consists of physical techniques and applied philosophies and requires the individual to train him or herself to their most cultivated state of being-ness,"" according to the Bruce Lee Foundation's website. Perfect awareness of one's own body and peace with one's own place in the world is vital to Lee's life work.
His advice to ""be water, my friend,"" has also been much-quoted down the years and is linked to this philosophy of malleability and complete awareness of one's own physical and spiritual self. Like water pouring into a cup and changing its shape, Lee advised adaptability while remaining true to one's own identity.
The most important part of Lee's legacy may be what he did for Asian actors in Hollywood. He was the first truly bankable Asian-American Hollywood star and, despite his untimely death, he managed to pave the way for future generations. He was one of the first Asian-American stars to have a starring role in a major international movie.
But his role as a well-read philosopher and thinker also deserves more attention from history. The book ""Artist of Life"" takes excerpts from his own private diaries. Meanwhile, his legacy is carried on by his daughter, Shannon Lee, who gives regular interviews and hosts a podcast about her father, simply titled, ""Bruce Lee Podcast.""

https://www.dw.com/en/actress-and-singer-jane-birkin-dies-aged-76/a-66247387,CULTURE,Actress and singer Jane Birkin dies aged 76 16.07.2023,"British-French actress and singer Jane Birkin has passed away in Paris at the age of 76, the French Culture Ministry said on Sunday.
The London-born entertainer suffered from health problems in recent years that forced her to cancel concerts. She had a mild stroke in 2021.
Birkin first became famous internationally in 1969 when she and her lover, the late French musician Serge Gainsbourg, sang the controversial hit song ""Je T'aime... Moi Non Plus"" with sexually explicit lyrics.
Jane Mallory Birkin was born in London in December 1946. Her mother was an actress Judy Campbell and her father a naval officer David Birkin.
Her first marriage came at 17, when Birkin married composer John Barry, himself famous for composing the iconic ""James Bond"" theme. Birkin and Barry had a daughter, Kate, but their marriage fell apart after only three years. 
In 1966, Birkin appeared nude in Michelangelo Antonioni's film ""Blow-Up"" as a part of a threesome sex scene.
Two years later, on a set of a romantic comedy in Paris, she met French singer and songwriter Serge Gainsbourg. Although Gainsbourg was 18 years older, the two started a 13-year-long relationship that prompted Birkin to permanently move to Paris and eventually made them France's most famous couple.
The two also had a daughter, Charlotte, who has become a successful actress and singer in her own right.
Birkin built her career and image in the 1970s, forming an iconic look which include flared jeans, mini dresses and messy bangs. In 1980, she left Gainsbourg to focus on her movie career, which also included art house productions with many of France's leading directors.
However, Birkin and Gainsbourg continued to cooperate professionally, with Gainsbourg writing songs for her after their split. The songwriter, who struggled with alcoholism, died of a heart attack in 1991 at  the age of 62.
Birkin continued to pursue her music career after Gainsbourg's death, releasing ""A la Legere"" in 1998, writing the album ""Arabesque"" in 2002 and publishing a collection of live recordings, ""Jane at the Palace"" in 2009.
The actress also left her mark in the world of fashion. In 1984, French luxury label Hermes named one of its handbags after her.
It is said that in 1981 Birkin was on a flight next to the late Jean-Louise Dumas, then CEO of Hermes. Birkin had tried to put her luggage in the overhead compartment and famously complained that she had yet to find a purse big enough to hold all of a woman's belongings. This prompted Dumas to prototype a bag that would become the iconic Birkin.
In 2015, Birkin asked Hermes to drop her name from the bag after animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals alerted her to the cruel farming practices of crocodiles for their leather. She later relented after Hermes investigated the practices and found them to be an ""isolated irregularity.""
""My best publicity comes from the Vatican,"" composer Serge Gainsbourg once said. His song ""Je t'aime,"" which he performed together with Jane Birkin in 1969, stirred an uproar not only in Rome. Their erotic number was even outlawed in many countries and German broadcasters refused to play the song at times. At the time, songs about sex were often indexed.

The Hollywood writers have been on strike since early May.
The historic double strike has brought the US TV and movie industry to a halt. The last time the two unions were on strike simultaneously was in 1960, when actor — and later US president — Ronald Reagan led the protests.
The unions' demands include establishing a system of residual payments from streaming platforms, as well as protections against the use of content generated by artificial intelligence.
TV shows that have already been affected by the writers' strike include ""Andor,"" ""Stranger Things,"" ""The Last of Us,"" ""Yellowjackets,"" ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" ""Blade Runner 2099"" and ""The Mandalorian,"" as well late-night shows such as ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.""
Film and TV projects that have already completed their shooting and are now in postproduction are not directly affected, but other productions have already postponed their release dates, including the sequel to ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" and Disney's ""Blade"" remake, whose scripts were not completed before the writers' strike.
The Marvel film ""Captain America: Brave New World"" reportedly wrapped its shoot just before the actors' strike started — though reshoots are often part of the production process in such films, which is why the release date has already been pushed back.
Other productions of highly anticipated movies forced to pause due to the strike include ""Beetlejuice 2"" from  Tim Burton, Marvel Studios' ""Deadpool 3,"" Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator 2,"" the martial arts sequel ""Mortal Kombat 2,"" the Tom Cruise action movie ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part Two"" and ""Paddington in Peru,"" the third film in the beloved Paddington Bear franchise.
Many more projects have been affected by the walkout, including international film and television productions with US stars. 
According to strike rules, actors must not only stop all production work, from auditions to shooting, but are also barred from promoting their work on podcasts or at premieres.
The ""Oppenheimer"" cast prematurely left the London premiere of the film on Thursday, a few hours before the actors' strike officially started.
Next week's other big release, ""Barbie,"" held its UK premiere on Wednesday, where lead star Margot Robbie said on the red carpet that she was ""absolutely"" in support of the strike.
The ban on promotion will also have an impact San Diego's Comic-Con, and the red carpets at upcoming film festivals in Venice and Toronto will lack the glitz of Hollywood stars.
The Emmy Awards, which announced their nominations on Thursday, are considering postponing their ceremony on September 18.
No one knows how long it will take for the actors' and screenwriters' unions to strike a deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the trade association representing Hollywood studios and streaming platforms in collective bargaining negotiations with entertainment industry trade unions.
 A previous writers' strike in 2007 went on for 100 days, right into 2008. The screenwriters' guild longest strike, in 1988, lasted 153 days.
The last time the actors' union staged a major walkout was in 1980, and it lasted more than three months.
Experts think this latest fight could drag on for months.

https://www.dw.com/en/alex-popps-legacy-shines-as-german-women-head-to-world-cup/a-66226194,SOCCER,Alex Popp's legacy shines as German women head to World Cup 14.07.2023,"Everything appeared to be lining up for Alex Popp on the eve of the Euro 2022 final in Wembley. After years of injury setbacks, she was finally on Europe's biggest stage in front of 87,000 fans.
With six goals in five games, Popp's blistering form led Germany to another big showdown after a few years in international wilderness.
But after tweaking a muscle during extra shooting practice in her final training session, Popp's dream of glory slipped away once again.
""It was extremely hard to grasp that I probably couldn't play a European Championship final,"" she told DW. ""It took me a really long time to process it. There were a lot of questions — should I have trained at all, should I have taken that one more shot?""
Popp pulled herself out of the starting lineup shortly before kickoff. Even though her aerial prowess would have still caused chaos for England, she sacrificed her dream for the team.
It's one reason why she is so loved among fans and why she commands respect from teammates who describe her as an ""icon.""
This journey toward inspirational leader started at a very young age in Germany's Ruhrgebiet, where a football-mad region forged a football-obsessed future Germany captain.
""I felt like I never had any other choice but to play football,"" said Popp. ""I started extremely early, when I was 4. Right from birth, I felt like I was always on a football pitch or in a gym.""
Such is life for many in a region where Germany's fiercest derby, between Borussia Dortmund and Schalke, captivates national and international audiences.
Popp's hero growing up in the small town of Gevelsberg was Andreas Möller, whom she admired from the Westfalenstadion stands with her mother and brother in Dortmund colors.
""My father, no chance, he's a Schalke fan,"" said Popp, laughing. ""I was so proud the first time I stood in the stadium and saw the Yellow Wall, felt the atmosphere. That was an incredible experience.""
Football was automatically entrenched in her soul and soon seeped into her legs as she realized she was pretty good at the game.
At 16, Popp made two big moves that would shape her professional career — the first was enrolling in school at the Gesamtschule Berger Feld, run by none other than Schalke.
Here, alongside her studies, Popp trained as the only girl with talented Schalke youths like Joel Matip, Ralf Fährmann and Max Meyer, which she said was essential to her development.
""I have to say, it wasn't easy to make it work,"" she said. ""At first the boys were very skeptical and didn't really know how to deal with me. But fairly early on we played five versus two and they saw 'OK, she's got something'. It calmed down quickly after that.""
Just as crucially, Popp earned a contract with FCR Duisburg, a German powerhouse at the time. She was now training with World Cup winners such as Inka Grings, Simone Laudehr and Annike Krahn and arrived with the typical swagger and arrogance of a teenager.
""I was very cheeky when I was younger,"" said Popp with a smile. ""I moved to Duisburg and actually thought 'Hey, I'm here now and I'm more or less better than you'. But I was soon shown very quickly that I wasn't.""
""She was quite young, in her character too,"" recalled ex-Duisburg teammate Krahn. ""But you could see that she had a certain talent, you saw that quickly on the pitch. And you could tell that she would progress in the years to come.""
Popp won the UEFA Cup (now Champions League) and the German Cup in her first season at Duisburg. And in 2010, she made her name on the international stage, winning the U-20 World Cup with Germany after scoring an incredible 10 goals in six games.
""She was already somewhat of a leader at that time. I wouldn't say she was a natural-born leader, but it was beginning to emerge. And she also developed in that direction quickly,"" said Krahn.
Under the tutelage of Grings, Popp started to master the art of goal scoring and would soon cement her place as Germany's go-to striker.
It was in Wolfsburg, however, that Popp truly grew into the dominant striker and leader she is today. In 11 years, she's scored 152 goals and won seven Bundesliga titles, nine German Cups and two Champions League trophies.
In her first season in 2012-13, Wolfsburg won the treble after defeating heavy favorites Lyon in the Champions League final.

""Personally I thought Lyon played with a certain arrogance, which just motivated us even more,"" said Popp. ""And we did it in the end. None of us could believe it. And we couldn't believe we'd also won the treble. That was a feeling that can't be described.""
At the age of 22, Popp had won it all in club football. But then began a rough run of injuries. An injury aggravated in the Champions League final meant she missed Euro 2013, which Germany won. And she sat out Euro 2017 as well after injuring herself during pre-tournament preparations.
And although she did win Gold at the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics with Germany, injuries were threatening to curtail her international career, so much so that at times she contemplated retirement.
""I think you learn something new with every injury,"" said Krahn. ""You get to know your body better, you develop your personality differently, and value your time on the pitch differently.""
So when Popp finally got to play in that European Championship in 2022, there was a feeling of redemption in the air.
That fateful injury sustained in shooting practice, however, robbed her of her big moment. Germany lost 2-1 in extra time without their inspirational captain, even though she was their biggest fan on the side of the pitch.
""I think, with a bit of reflection, she can be very proud of what she achieved. And also proud of how she dealt with it,"" said Krahn.
Now, it's time to go again. And there is fire in Popp's belly as she looks to lead Germany back to the top of international football at the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.
""She shows that you should just keep at it, stay on your path and not let anything get you down. She's definitely inspired me a lot,"" said Kathrin Hendrich. ""Poppi is an icon. If you ask anyone in Germany which footballer comes to mind first, then she would be top of the list.""
That adulation makes Popp the star attraction whenever Germany trains or plays, but she's purely focused on leading her team back to the top of international football. She's said multiple times in the past weeks that Germany believe they can go all the way.
""I'm really looking forward to the World Cup. And I think we can play a big role in the title race,"" she said.
Germany face Morocco, Colombia and South Korea in Group H. Topping the group and navigating the round of 16 could line up a potential rematch against England in the quarterfinals.
There's little doubt Popp will have extra motivation to play in that showdown. It will be another chance to make up for lost time, and find redemption.
The 34-year-old is one of the biggest stars of women's football. The forward has won two FIFA Women's World Cup titles and an Olympic gold. Her daughter, Elena, arrived in 2020. ""As much as I love playing soccer, and doing that every single day, I now play for more than myself. I don't know if I would say I'm a different player. I just think that I'm more evolved,"" she told the LA Times.

https://www.dw.com/en/ales-pushkin-the-tragic-end-of-a-lukashenko-critic-in-belarus/a-66223784,POLITICS,Ales Pushkin: The tragic end of a Lukashenko critic in Belarus 13.07.2023,"Ales Pushkin, an artist and political prisoner from Belarus, died in the intensive care unit under ""unexplained circumstances,"" his wife Janina Demuch announced on Tuesday. Pushkin was serving a five-year sentence in prison No. 1 in the small city of Grodno in western Belarus.
Pushkin had an ulcer and did not receive timely medical treatment, independent Belarusian media reported, citing unnamed sources informed on the matter. He was arrested in March 2021 and, a year later, sentenced for desecrating state symbols and inciting hatred.
The reason? Pushkin had painted a portrait of Yevgeny Shikhar, the leader of the Belarusian anti-Soviet underground after World War II, and shown it at an exhibition.
Belarusian investigators considered this to be ""rehabilitation of Nazism,"" even though he created the painting back in 2014 and it had previously been displayed in Belarus and Russia.
The terms of Pushkin's incarceration were tightened in November 2022. Not long after, he was transferred from prison No. 22 in   Ivatsevichy in the Brest region to Grodno. Pushkin had a hard time from the beginning, said Aliaksandr Ivulin, a journalist and former political prisoner who was in the same jail as Pushkin.
He was ""too friendly,"" Ivulin said, even to the prison guards, who took away his notes and drawings without giving him a reason.
Once moved to prison No. 1, his exchange of letters with the Belarusian artist Lera Lasuk ended, DW has learned. After that, Pushkin was only allowed to write to his family. From the new prison, he sent drawings and described his daily life and his cellmates. He made sketches of larger works that he wanted to complete once he was released.
""We had some disagreements, but we were joined by our love of art and of Belarus. I value him for his bright, iconic pieces, for his courage and for standing up for his principles,"" said Lasuk.
Pushkin was a non-conformist painter, theatermaker, performer and curator. He staged one of his first performance pieces during Soviet rule in Belarus in 1989. And not on any day: He chose the 71st anniversary of the Belarusian People's Republic. The state's existence was proclaimed on March 25, 1918, under German protectorate, but ceased to exist shortly after when part of its territory was won by the Polish armed forces and the other part by the Soviet Red Army in the Polish-Soviet War of 1919 to 1921.
Pushkin began the anniversary with a march through Independence Avenue in Minsk, followed by about a hundred supporters carrying a paper stork and 71 white balloons. Pushkin and 35 other people were arrested, and the artist received a two-year suspended sentence.
Pushkin's most famous performance was ""Dung for the President"" in July 1999. On the fifth anniversary of Alexander Lukashenko's ascent to power, the artist transported a pile of manure to the presidential administration in Minsk, threw worthless ruble notes on top and added the country's constitution plus a portrait of the ruler for good measure. Then he stabbed everything with a pitchfork.
For this stunt, the artist was also given a two-year suspended sentence. Pushkin reenacted the performance at an exhibition in Kyiv on March 25, 2021. This appears to have prompted Belarusian authorities to charge him with ""desecration of state symbols.""
Pushkin also worked on the restoration of historical buildings and on church frescoes. His most important work, in his view, was the decoration of the new church of his home village Bobr, near Minsk.
In one of the frescoes, Pushkin depicted Lukashenko and the then-metropolitan (a leadership position in some Orthodox churches) of the unrecognized Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Filaret, among sinners, surrounded by forces of the Belarusian special police unit OMON. The fresco was later painted over.
Rights organizations in Belarus, like Viasna, the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights and Legal Initiative, considered Pushkin a political prisoner. The leader of the Belarusian democratic opposition movement, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who lives in exile in Lithuania, has blamed the artist's death on Lukashenko.
""Ales Pushkin was the embodiment of the indomitable spirit of the Belarusian people. He died as a political prisoner of the regime, and the responsibility lies with his jailor, Lukashenka & his cronies,"" she wrote on Twitter, using another spelling of the president's name.
""Ales used his art to fight for freedom and build a new Belarus without tyranny,"" she added. ""He dreamed of a free and democratic Belarus. Now we must continue his work and make his dream come true.""

Instead, it revealed itself to be a book on how to be,"" writes Rick Rubin about his approach to ""The Creative Act: A Way of Being.""
You can pretty much find a best-selling self-help book about anything these days, from decluttering your mind to your wardrobe. Sometimes self-improvement book themes seem so trite, it leaves you thinking — is this really what's going to make you transform your life?
But since the prolific US music producer is already seen by many in the industry as a guru, it only makes sense to have him share his wisdom with the masses. ""The Creative Act: A Way of Being"" brings creativity into a new realm of self-discovery. 
Rubin started his career in the 1980s as a 20-year-old university student, when he founded his record label, Def Jam, in his dorm room in New York.
After Russell Simmons joined the company, things took off. Rubin discovered the Beastie Boys, and convinced them to abandon punk and turn to rap.
Def Jam played a pivotal role in popularizing hip hop, by signing acts including LL Cool J, Run-DMC and Public Enemy, and later Jay-Z and Foxy Brown.
Rubin helped Aerosmith make a comeback in 1986, recording a remake of their 1975 song, ""Walk This Way,"" with the rap trio Run-DMC. 
Later, Rubin sold his shares in Def Jam for a three-digit million sum, moved to Los Angeles, started a new label, and also worked as a producer for artists signed to other record labels.
In the 1990s, the song-doctor with the long untamed beard produced the Red Hot Chili Peppers album ""Blood Sugar Sex Magik"" that shot the band into international popularity. Rubin's touch also allowed country music icon Johnny Cash to make a major comeback with his award-winning ""American Recordings"" album series. 
He helped the heavy metal band Metallica out of a musical crisis with the 2008 album ""Death Magnetic,"" and produced works with many more of the world's top stars. His CV also includes collaborations with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Mick Jagger, Eminem, Rage Against the Machine, U2, Ed Sheeran, Lady Gaga, Adele and many more.
Rubin has said in interviews that he doesn't even know how to play an instrument, nor does he have much of an idea about studio technology. To produce an album, he places importance on how he feels.
In his book, he puts it this way: ""When the work has five mistakes, it's not finished. But when a work has eight mistakes, it might be. Sometimes deciding a work is finished is more about surrender than victory.""
Rick Rubin is a spiritual man, drawing inspiration from Eastern philosophy and cosmic influences. The studio on his ranch in the hills of Malibu is called Shangri-La, named after the fictional paradise in the high Tibetan mountains in James Hilton's novel ""Lost Horizon.""
Rubin has enough knowledge and experience to write 10 books. It is said that some publishers hoped he'd spice up his book with anecdotes of big names he's worked with to make it more commercial.
But Rubin avoids name-dropping and he also doesn't think he has all the answers. In the preface, he advises readers to take on what helps them and leave the rest.  
Various obstacles, including self-doubt and everyday distractions, get in the way of living out our best creative selves, according to Rubin. He has developed his own strategies to deal with creative blocks and the pressure to exceed or at least match the success of the last album.
Despite all the hits, Rubin's portfolio is by no means limited to successful records. For him, as he states in his book,  success is measured neither by popularity nor by money, but internally.
In the case of a creative block, Rubin recommends visualizing a completely different audience for a song that's being worked on, or simply writing fewer lyrics, because sometimes letting go is the best way to stick to a project. Sometimes he simply turns off the lights in the studio to change the atmosphere.
Nevertheless, creativity also requires a certain level of discipline for which Rubin lays down some ground rules, even though he later in the book contradicts himself by writing that artistic creation is based on disregarding rules, letting them go and subverting them.
Some of the wisdom he shares in ""The Creative Act"" might appear too simplistic, including truisms such as, ""The better you feel, the better things go.""
Other parts of the book give more substantial advice, though they often echo words of wisdom already heard elsewhere: ""Creativity can just be a relationship with yourself. No one else needs to be in the equation,"" he writes. ""Sometimes the therapeutic value of making the work is the outcome. And that's enough.""
The producer, whose net worth is estimated at  $300 million, often emphasizes in the book that creativity shouldn't be about sales: ""Putting commercial concerns before personal taste is a losing battle.""
Anything can be a source of inspiration, he says, especially nature. Rubin recommends always walking through life attentively and trying things out without worrying about the meaning or a measurable result. It stands in contrast to society's capitalistic values.
Obviously, not every creative undertaking requires a fat bank account. Nevertheless, the challenge for ordinary people in implementing Rubin's lessons is likely to be the daily grind, which is not exactly known as a driving force for creativity. Creative contemplation is a luxury that won't pay the bills.
In one of last year's episodes of Rubin's podcast ""Broken Record,"" he talked with the lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Anthony Kiedis. They discussed the band's two latest albums, ""Unlimited Love"" and ""Return of the Dream Canteen,"" which were produced by Rubin. Released within a few months in 2022, they received generally positive reviews.
Both producer and singer seemed very pleased with the results. They talked about recording in Hawaii, where they were able to work undisturbed for months during the pandemic lockdown. Every day, Kiedis rode his bike through heavenly landscapes to work with Rubin.
Kiedis shared that he would not have been able to do it without escaping the daily grind, big-city traffic and other distractions.
Perhaps palm trees are not a prerequisite for creativity. But they don't hurt either.

The most recent biopic, released June 23, is about the life of Elvis Presley, played by Austin Butler. The main focus is on the complicated relationship with his shady manager, Colonel Tom Parker (Tom Hanks). Electrifying music and stage scenes thanks to director Baz Luhrmann, and Butler's outstanding portrayal of the King of Rock 'n' Roll, make the film a must-see.

https://www.dw.com/en/mission-impossible-tom-cruise-and-other-stunt-performing-stars/a-66198263,FILM,'Mission: Impossible': Tom Cruise and other stunt-performing stars 13.07.2023,"The new mission echoes the world's current AI concerns: In ""Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,"" Tom Cruise plays agent Ethan Hunt for the seventh time, fighting against a computer program that has gotten out of control and is threatening to wipe out humanity.
The ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is a recipe for success for Hollywood. One of the aspects that makes the series so popular is that Tom Cruise performs many of the film stunts himself, without the aid of CGI or stunt doubles. That approach has turned him into an action megastar.
Unforgettable scenes in the previous movies include Tom Cruise climbing up the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, or hanging from a plane as it takes off.
A highlight of the new film combines a motorcycle stunt and a parachute jump.
Like the ""John Wick"" films with Keanu Reeves, the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise counters the trend of having blockbuster action scenes created exclusively through CGI.
Cruise is perhaps the most famous action star doing his own stunts today. But other actors, including older ones, also insist on filming dangerous sequences themselves in order to make the movie feel more authentic.
This includes Chinese martial arts legend Jackie Chan, who has insisted on doing practically all of his stunts himself since the 1970s.
His most notable performances are in ""Snake in the Eagle's Shadow"" (1978), ""Police Story"" and ""Police Story 2"" (1985 and 1988) and ""Armour of God"" (1986).
During the filming of the latter, Chan almost died while filming a relatively simple stunt. Jumping from a ledge onto a tree, he fell and crashed onto a rock, breaking a few ribs and cracking his skull.
In her Oscar-winning role in ""Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" 60-year-old Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh portrays a laundromat owner who in an alternate universe is also a famous martial arts movie star — inspired by the actress' own career.
Yeoh, who is also among the stars renowned for performing stunts herself, played alongside Jackie Chan in action classics like ""Police Story 3: Supercop"" or ""Supercop 2."" She rose to international prominence with the 2000 martial arts film, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" in which she also did her own stunts.
Canadian actor Keanu Reeves doesn't shy away from getting his hands dirty in action-packed scenes either. In films like ""Speed"" (1994), ""Matrix"" (1999) or the ""John Wick"" series, he jumps out of moving cars and fights his opponents in nerve-wracking scenes.
Following the release of ""John Wick 3,"" Reeves confirmed in an interview that he did almost all of the stunt work himself: ""I do all of the action. I'm 90 percent of what's happening there. I'm maintaining the connection to the audience, and with the story.""
""Indiana Jones"" star Harrison Ford can't be left out of any list of actors performing their own stunts.
The 80-year-old actor has had an impressive film career spanning six decades. His most successful films include the ""Star Wars"" saga and the ""Indiana Jones"" series.
The opening scene of the first Indiana Jones movie,""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is particularly iconic, with Harrison Ford running away from a giant boulder that is chasing him. Even though the rock was a prop, it was still heavy enough to seriously injure the actor, who was not doubled in the scene.
Ford completely immersed himself in the role of daredevil archeologist Indiana Jones.
In the recently released ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"" he still took over many stunts himself, dislocating his shoulder while filming. But for real action stars, that's just part of the job.

https://www.dw.com/en/are-german-theaters-safe-places-to-work/a-66188293,CULTURE,Are German theaters safe places to work? 12.07.2023,"Berlin's Maxim Gorki Theater has a reputation as the home of alternative, political theater in the German capital. Recent productions have focused on the fight for women's freedom in Iran and brought together a group of artists ""in exile.""
But in 2021, a cloud descended on the famous theater, when some of those in power and executive director Shermin Langhoff faced allegations of bullying and misuse of power — of creating what German magazine Der Spiegel called a ""climate of fear.""
The theater, along with other German publicly funded stages, promised to take the allegations seriously and put change into effect if necessary.
But recent research by German public broadcaster ARD shows that 90% of those who responded to an anonymous survey — apparently including former and current employees of Maxim Gorki Theater — claimed to have experienced abuse. In most cases the allegations were of verbal abuse, but several cases of alleged physical and sexual abuses were also reported.
Theater bosses have questioned the representative nature of the survey, given that it was conducted anonymously and without independent fact checking. But according to the biggest union of German theater workers, the GDBA (Guild of the German Stage), the problems the survey highlights are very real.
""We take the survey very seriously. To be clear: It is not a scientific study. The survey itself also explicitly presents its results as non-representative. But that does not make it any less meaningful,"" trade union general secretary Lauren Schubbe told DW.
""The (ARD subsidiary) RBB team's research shows that hundreds of theater professionals are willing to take the time and feel the need to share their experiences of abuse of power in theaters. It has produced 400 detailed accounts of specific cases, each one of which is one too many.""
He mentioned the #MeToo movement and the conditions that emerged through the COVID pandemic as reasons why people may now be more willing to speak out.
""However, we do not conclude from this that there was less abuse of power in theaters in the past,"" he added. ""On the contrary, there have already been the first tentative successes and measures to curb it.""
In reaction to the #MeToo wave of scandals, several theaters have introduced codes of conduct over the course of the past few years. But measuring how effective these codes of conduct are is not an exact science.
""This is a situation that cannot be tolerated,"" Claudia Schmitz, the director of the Deutscher Bühnenverein, an organization that represents 430 German theaters, said in a statement. ""The question is how to proceed, and my answer is that the path that the stages have been taking since 2018 must be consistently continued.""
Her solution referred to the values-based code of conduct which many German theaters agreed to in 2018 and again in 2021.
Volksbühne, for example, one of Berlin's other major publicly-funded theaters, told DW that ""the staff council and the women's representative of the Volksbühne regularly invite employees to a meeting of the Code of Conduct working group. This is an open committee of Volksbühne employees that has set itself the task of promoting a harassment-free working environment.""
Claudia Schmitz from the Deutscher Bühnenverein is clear that such programs can work: ""It is not just a piece of paper from the association, but an expression of opinion from all members, including the theater directors and artistic directors, who say that we have a responsibility to ensure that the theater is a space free of fear and that we deal with power in a way that does not lead to discrimination or injury,"" Schmitz said. She also indicated that a fresh generation at the helm of certain theaters may help implement these codes of conduct.
Codes of conduct have also been brought in by organizations connected with German stars who have recently been embroiled in allegations of misconduct in other industries, including Till Lindemann of band Rammstein and actor, producer and director Till Schweiger.
But union representative Schubbe said that such codes of conduct are ""toothless"" unless they are ""backed up by concrete and binding measures such as counseling services, complaints procedures and sanction options.""
""In order to achieve fundamental improvements, we must also question what makes abuse of power in theaters structurally favorable and then also change these structures,"" he added.
One of the problems raised by respondents to the survey is related to the length of contracts. Contracts are regularly only renewed every few theater seasons, meaning that those whose visas and residency rights are linked to their jobs may be more vulnerable to abuse and less likely to speak out.
An ongoing dispute between the Bühnenverein, representing the employers, and the trade union, representing the employees, once again failed to reach any conclusions on the topic in June.
Like all performing arts industries, German theaters have struggled to bounce back since the pandemic and the ongoing cost of living crisis.
DW has been in contact with Maxim Gorki Theater about this report, who were unable to provide a comment owing to the theater's summer break.

https://www.dw.com/en/lgbtq-activism-seeking-queer-love-in-middle-eastern-history/a-66138244,SOCIETY,LGBTQ activism: Seeking queer love in Middle Eastern history 10.07.2023,"""When I'm trying to impress someone I'm into, I like to send them classical poems that celebrate male beauty,"" Fouad, a 26-year-old gay man, explained during a call with DW. “It’s proven to be very effective,"" he said, laughing.   
Fouad is from Lebanon, one of the few Arab countries where homosexuality is not explicitly illegal. But due to the government’s recent crackdown on the local LGBTQ community he chooses to maintain a low profile and won't share his full name.  
Fouad finds inspiration in classical poems by the 8th-century poet Abu Nawas, who was renowned for his homoerotic verses.  
Abu Nawas and many other classical Arab, Persian and Turkish poets explored same-sex desires centuries ago. But their legacy has been sidelined in the modern Middle East because homosexuality is a criminal offense in most countries in the region.  

The claim that same-sex relationships are not part of the Middle East’s indigenous culture finds support from many officials and religious leaders. One example is Ahmed al-Tayeb, the grand imam of Al-Azhar, the 1,000-year-old seat of Sunni learning in Cairo, Egypt. Al-Tayeb repeatedly calls homosexuality a Western cultural import.
But many LGBTQ activists hold the opposite view. They blame colonialism for spreading homophobia in the region.
In a video of her TED talk, Blair Imani, an African-American queer Muslim woman, criticizes the idea that Muslim societies have historically held rigid attitudes toward sexuality. ""When Muslims and Christians came into contact with each other, Muslims were known to be more sexually permissive [than Christians],"" she told her audience.  
However, the history of same-sex romance in the Middle East is complex and nuanced. 
Historical research shows that kings, commanders, judges, as well as ordinary individuals, displayed relative openness towards non-heterosexual desires. 
For instance, Muslim travelers visiting Europe in the mid-19th century found it noteworthy that European men did not court young men. In return, European travelers visiting pre-colonial Arab communities were shocked to see men openly expressing their attraction for boys. 
Records also indicate recognition of transgender individuals, with some medieval Arabic dictionaries and encyclopedias describing five or more categories of sexes. In a 2020 essay, Shireen Hamza, a researcher at Harvard University, describes these as ""woman, masculine woman, khuntha, effeminate man or man.""
A ""khuntha"" was somewhere between the genders. Hamza also writes about a judicial case where a Muslim judge in 16th-century Damascus permitted a transgender woman to marry a man who was in love with her. 
Still, historians are cautious about branding the pre-colonial Middle East as LGBTQ-tolerant. 
Sexual orientation was not seen as central to an individual's identity in Muslim societies. The medieval Arab world viewed sexual attraction in conflicting ways, Khaled el-Rouayheb, an historian at Harvard University, writes. Expressions of same-sex attraction were met with varying degrees of tolerance and intolerance, el-Rouayheb explains in his 2007 book, ""Before Homosexuality.""
For example, Islamic scholars distinguished between sexual intercourse between two men and the less physical expression of love for another man. The first was considered a sin, while the latter was a sign of refined sensibility, the ability to appreciate human beauty.
Attitudes towards same-sex attraction radically changed in the contemporary Middle East, with Western colonialism thought to have played an important role.  
France and Britain, each controlling major parts of the Arab world, introduced the first penal codes against homosexuality in the region. In Algeria for example, French colonial forces stipulated severe punishments for same-sex relationships, including imprisonment and forced labor. 
Their influence persisted long after they left their colonies. Nationalist projects adopted the colonial notion that regarded same-sex attraction as decadence or a form of mental illness. Islamist movements followed suit, criminalizing same-sex relations. As a result, poets like Abu Nawas, who had long been celebrated for their literary talent, became controversial and had their poetry censored.
The Arab world still has a blind spot about this, according to Samar Habib, a US-based novelist, and independent researcher. But the Arab LGBTQ community is now going through history to build a case against discrimination, she noted. ""This is how you create a body of resistance,"" Habib told DW. 
Persian and Arabic literature are used within LGBTQ activist circles to demonstrate that homophobia is not universal in Arabic and Persian histories and cultures, Habib said.
Mashrou Leila, a popular Lebanese indie-rock band, has produced dozens of songs about queer love, drawing on historical and traditional allusions and mentioning figures like Abu Nawas. The band's open support for the LGBTQ community faced backlash from some governments in the region, resulting in their prohibition in Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt, and ultimately leading them to disband in 2022. 
Similarly, the Middle Eastern LGBTQ community's heritage is increasingly taking center stage in visual arts and paintings. One popular example is  ""Habibi, les revolutions de l'amour"" (or Habibi, Love Revolution""), an art exhibition at the Paris-based Arab World Institute, that delves into Middle Eastern queer culture, interweaving traditional elements and historical references from Arab and Persian cultures.  
Social media is also witnessing an increase in posts highlighting same-sex love in the literature and history of Muslim-majority societies, with some users suggesting that Islamic law has a lot of space for interpretations that could incorporate LGBTQ rights. 

The Middle Eastern LGBTQ community faces a double-edged challenge, Aya Labanieh, a researcher at Columbia University in New York, told DW. ""One side is the domestic repression, which brands their identity as an imported one, foreign to Islamic society and culture. The second is the Islamophobic narratives that treat them as tokens and use their grievances to portray a dark picture of Muslim societies."" Consequently, queer activists are increasingly emphasizing the indigenous aspects of their identity, she noted.  
However, the past should not be glamorized either, Labanieh warns. ""A critical review, that also considers modern values like equality and rights, is necessary,"" she said.  
With the help of his father, Fouad began reading classical Arabic poetry at a young age. It later served as a refuge from trauma. ""I know many gays and lesbians who grow up hating themselves because they have been led to believe that there is something wrong with them,"" he said. ""I didn't experience that because as a teenager I could see geniuses like Abu Nawas had the same desires I did."" 
Before the interview ends, Fouad recites his favorite verses by Abu Nawas, saying they hold a message for everyone: ""Let go of the costumes and ethics that have been destroyed over time, left to the wind and rain, given to inevitable decay. Be among those who live life in pleasures and risks.""

https://www.dw.com/en/japan-tattoo-artists-want-to-wash-off-criminal-connection/a-66177883,CULTURE,Japan: Tattoo artists want to wash off criminal connection 10.07.2023,"Japan's Bunshin Tattoo Museum in Yokohama is dedicated to the work of Yoshihito Nakano, who is better known in the body art world as Horiyoshi III, a master of traditional Japanese tattooing.
The museum is presided over by Horiyoshi's wife, Mayumi Nakano. Wearing a sleeveless shirt that reveals entwined flower tattoos in vivid reds, greens and yellows from her wrists to her shoulders, she confides that she received her first tattoo when she was 20. It was at the hands of her husband. 
""Tattoos are misunderstood in Japan,"" she tells DW, surrounded by stencils of intricate tattoo designs and pictures of his satisfied clients.
""Tattoos have always been associated with the underworld gangs, but I had hoped that would change over time. Even though there is no stigma attached to tattoos in other countries, Japanese society is not ready to change,"" says Nakano.
Now 77, Horiyoshi has said in interviews that he first became mesmerized by tattoos at the age of 11 or 12 after he saw a yakuza member with a traditional full body tattoo at his local public bathhouse. He earned the title Horiyoshi III, after working as an apprentice for the legendary tattoo master Shodai Horiyoshi of Yokohama.
The winner of countless awards for his work, Horiyoshi used to do the outlines of his designs by hand until the 1990s, when he started using electric machines. Colors and shading are still added with the traditional ""tebori"" technique, which uses a slender bamboo or metal rod with needles attached to the tip.
As with most Japanese tattoo artists, Horiyoshi's designs are variations of iridescent ""koi"" carp, dragons, tigers, snakes, peony flowers and maple leaves. Others are inspired by Buddhist deities or creatures from mythology. Bright pink cherry blossoms are also popular designs.
In an interview with The Japan Times newspaper, Horiyoshi once said ""The creatures I draw come alive on somebody's skin.""
However, there is no doubt that the vast majority of Japanese perceive tattoos as a mark of criminality. And that has not washed off over time. 
In ancient times, the indigenous people of Hokkaido, the Ainu, practiced tattooing with ink made from the indigo plant. The people in the islands to the far south of mainland Japan, then the Ryukyu Kingdom but now incorporated into Japan as Okinawa Prefecture, also applied skin art inspired by their environment and culture.
During the Edo period, between 1603 and 1867, rule over the nation became more centralized and the punishment for certain types of crimes was tattooing.
Thieves were tattooed and a murderer had a mark permanently added to his or her face. Unsurprisingly, tattoos became synonymous with criminals, even though there was the parallel development of decorative tattoos and the emergence of a distinctive artistic genre. 
Tattoos were outlawed entirely in the early years of the Meiji period, which began in 1868. It was believed that elaborate markings would shock or offend foreigners as Japan opened its borders and sent political and trade missions abroad.
An underground tattooing industry thrived, however, with foreigners particularly keen to obtain Japanese-style skin art. 
The British royal family was particularly interested in Japanese tattoos, with Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh having a writhing dragon inked on his right forearm in Tokyo in 1869. Similarly, Prince Albert and George, Prince of Wales, were sailors aboard HMS Bacchante and both were tattooed during a visit in 1881. 
Tattooing became legal once again in 1948, but it was unable to shake its criminal connotations, especially as tens of thousands of men became members of rival yakuza gangs in the difficult decades following World War II. 
Given that association, companies have long refused to employ anyone with a tattoo simply out of concern that customers or business partners will assume the firm has links to Japan's criminal underworld.
Equally, anyone with a tattoo is likely to be banned from a public swimming pool or a ""sento"" or ""onsen"" public bath. People with visible tattoos get a wide berth on beaches.  
However, despite the Japanese public's refusal to embrace tattoos, there are signs that the government's attitude is changing. Concerned at falling recruitment rates, Japan's Defense Ministry has indicated that it is planning to alter its regulations to let men or women with a tattoo to join the armed forces. 

""In Japan, tattoos are still very much a niche subculture associated with people in music, art or fashion,"" said Kyle Cleveland, a professor of Japanese culture at the Tokyo campus of Temple University. ""But it is important to distinguish between the historic roots and the links with the yakuza and the tattoos that are being worn today, especially by young people,"" he told DW.
There was a debate in Japanese society before the Tokyo Olympic Games over athletes from all over the world competing with visible tattoos, Cleveland said, which continues today as foreign tourists flock to Japan. But these are distinct from the tattoos that still mark out the underworld, he added. 
The tattoos that gang members wear are ""deeply symbolic and are designed to indicate membership"" of a criminal group, Cleveland said.
On the other hand, designs that are more common elsewhere, such as playful designs of flowers or animals, a favorite quote or image, are extremely individualistic, Cleveland points out, and often mark a life transition, such as a marriage, birth or death. 
Japanese society, at present, negatively conflates the two, he added, making it hard for tattoos to gain traction. 
In the Bunshin Tattoo Museum, Mayumi Nakano is not convinced change is on the horizon in Japan, even as tattoos remain popular elsewhere around the world. 
On a table stands a framed picture of David Bowie when he visited Horiyoshi III's studio in about 1990. 
""He was a real gentleman,"" she says. ""And he understood.""

https://www.dw.com/en/how-the-nazis-destroyed-berlins-thriving-fashion-industry/a-66172345,CULTURE,How the Nazis destroyed Berlin's thriving fashion industry 10.07.2023,"Even though Berlin Fashion Week  takes place twice every year, in January and now from July 10-13, the German city doesn't exactly hold the title of the capital of fashion. 
That's why even Berliners are surprised when they find out that their city used to be a thriving fashion hub before World War II. And it was mainly thanks to Jewish entrepreneurs who were pioneers of modern fashion in Berlin.
The clothing industry took off in Berlin in the 1830s. Industrial sewing machines introduced in the 1850s were a game changer: A shirt could be made in one hour instead of eight.
Amid this industrialization process, Germany's social and political context allowed Jewish entrepreneurs to set the tone. 
For centuries, Jewish people living in Germany had been suffering from legal restrictions that affected their ability to make a livelihood and pushed most of them into poverty. Many were peddlers trading in haberdashery and second-hand clothes, while wealthy Jews traded in fine fabrics, explains Uwe Westphal, a freelance journalist and author of ""Fashion Metropolis Berlin 1836 - 1939. The Story of the Rise and Destruction of the Jewish Fashion Industry.""
Westphal, who has dedicated almost 40 years to researching, lecturing and writing about the forgotten Jewish fashion industry in Berlin, points out that the Industrial Revolution in the mid-19th century was followed by the foundation of the German Empire in 1871, which enshrined new rights for Jews in its constitution, allowing the German Jewish population  to thrive.
In 1871, there were just over 800,000 inhabitants in Berlin. By the 1920s, the German capital became a metropolis with a population of over four million, 4% of which were Jewish.
Jews flocked from rural areas to the big city to look for opportunities. ""Amongst them were tailors, seamstresses and entrepreneurs such as David Leib Levin, who came from Köningsberg. He opened a factory for women's coats, and in 1840 was one of the first to use fixed prices for his wares,"" says Westphal.
Fashion trends from Paris, especially haute couture, were too expensive for the middle classes and white-collar workers, who were nevertheless increasingly interested in looking fashionable. So the Jewish entrepreneurs ""came up with the idea of producing cheap fashionable clothing according to standardized measures,"" explains Westphal. ""The demand was there, and the industry grew rapidly.""
Berlin's fashion industry reached its height in the roaring 20s, with more than 2,700 fashion companies predominantly owned by Jewish families. Names such as the Manheimer brothers, David Leib Levin, Nathan Israel and Hermann Gerson were synonymous with the new and growing trend of ready-to-wear fashion. 
Jewish entrepreneurs quickly adapted to the new needs of the industrial era: ""They had a feeling for what people liked and they had international connections to fabric producers,"" Westphal says.
The garments were sold in glamorous department stores, which were mainly owned by Jewish families too.
Berlin's fashion industry also enjoyed international success and exported to the US, the Netherlands, England, Scandinavia and Argentina. Berlin offered cheap, stylish and high-quality day-to-day clothing. The ideas for designs were copied straight off from the Parisian couture shows. Business was booming.
Antisemitism and envy of the Jews' success in the industry existed from early on. But with Hitler's rise to power in 1933, the Jewish-owned businesses suffered massive blows, starting with the boycott against Jewish stores established on April 1 that same year.
The companies of Jewish fashion manufacturers were then systematically taken over by members of the Nazi party: ""Jews were soon forbidden to take out bank loans. For the clothing companies, this was a disaster. You couldn't have fashion shows without bank guarantees,"" explains Westphal, which is why Jews were forced into making Nazi party members partners in their companies to have access to funds, and finally transferring ownership at ridiculously low prices. 
In the November pogroms of 1938, groups of Nazi supporters stormed hundreds of companies on Hausvogteiplatz in the Berlin district of Mitte, which was the city's center of Jewish fashion. They destroyed everything they could get their hands on: ""Of the 2,700 Jewish fashion companies, only 24 were left, and they too were confiscated by 1940 at the latest,"" says Westphal.
According to Westphal, the Nazis' main interest was the real estate around Hausvogteiplatz, because the party was looking for new offices.
Later, forced laborers worked in fashion workshops set near concentration camps.  
Josef Neckermann and Hugo Boss are just two prominent names among several owners of companies who profited greatly from the Nazi forced hostile takeover of Jewish businesses. ""They oversaw production of clothing and military uniforms,"" points out Westphal. 
Berlin fashion designers in the 1950s and 60s were content to have no Jewish competition. But by then, West Germany's fashion industry had moved from Berlin to Düsseldorf and Munich, due to the division of the city. The East German state had no real interest in fashion. By the 70s, Germany had became a minor player in fashion, Westphal explains.
""Everything that fashion once was, especially in the 1920s — fashion schools, the overarching culture between fashion, architecture, the Bauhaus, music, the film industry and the visual arts in general — all of that was completely destroyed,"" says Westphal.
""What I find scary is that since 1945, nobody wants to remember this fashion culture. There's no commemoration of the many Jewish fashion designers. This stands in stark contrast to many German companies that were deeply involved in the Nazi state and have tried to make good since then,"" says the expert. 
In the early 90s, Westphal's frustration led to campaigning for a memorial at Hausvogteiplatz with the support of the Jewish community in Berlin. In 2000, the memorial was inaugurated with funding by the Berlin government.
Berlin's traditional Jewish fashion industry is long gone, but as part of the upcoming Days of Jewish Culture festival, a fashion show of contemporary Jewish and Israeli designers will take place on September 7. According to Westphal, it is the first Jewish fashion show in the German capital since 1939.

https://www.dw.com/en/should-soviet-monuments-be-dismantled-or-preserved/a-65949228,CULTURE,Should Soviet monuments be dismantled or preserved? 09.07.2023,"For some, Soviet monuments symbolize the Red Army's occupation and the Stalinist regime's repression; for others, they commemorate the USSR's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.
Russia's full scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 once again fueled the debate in different Eastern European countries, including in Latvia and Poland, where imposing Soviet monuments, such as the Victory Monument in Riga, were hastily dismantled.
In Bulgaria, however, public opinion is strongly divided on what should be done with the communist-era monuments. One of the reasons for this division is the lack of historical reappraisal of the communist past. As a result, a large part of the population still romanticizes this period.
At the center of the controversy is a memorial complex known as the Monument to the Soviet Army, right in the middle of the Bulgarian capital, Sofia.
Over the past decade, the association ""Initiative for Dismantling the Soviet Army Monument"" has been campaigning to have it removed from the city center.
The monument was built in 1954, 10 years after the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria, during a period of suppression of all resistance against the Bulgarian communist regime.
""Following the invasion of the Red Army, a communist regime was established in Bulgaria. This monument was created under an unfree regime, at a time when occupiers called themselves liberators,"" says Marta Georgieva from the Initiative for Dismantling the Soviet Army Monument. The association aims to increase the population's awareness for their history through their actions. 
Marta Georgieva also sees parallels between what happened in Bulgaria at the time and what is happening in Ukraine today: ""An army simply invades a country and declares itself a liberator when it wins the war."" 
During the Second World War, from 1941 to 1944, Bulgaria was on the side of the Axis powers, but did not send soldiers to the Eastern Front and refused to declare war on the Soviet Union.
In August 1944, Bulgaria terminated its pact with Nazi-Germany and declared neutrality. However, Bulgaria's offer of an armistice was rejected by Moscow and the Soviet Union declared war on Sofia. Within the first three months after the Red Army's invasion of Bulgaria on September 9, 1944, a communist regime was installed, and between 18,000 and 30,000 people — including clergy, journalists, former ministers and landowners — were murdered.   
But people in Bulgaria know too little about this dark chapter of their history. It's a gap that needs to be filled — and getting rid of the monument is part of that process, according to Marta Georgieva and her team. 
""We want this square to be depoliticized, because this monument divides us as a society,"" says Kuper Saparev, another member of the initiative. ""Because of the monument, we cannot use the square, it doesn't look to the future, but rather serves as criminal propaganda of the past and causes a lot of tension."" 
As early as 1993, the city council had decided to dismantle the monument. But since then, various institutions have been dodging responsibility for its removal.
""We've proven that this is not a cultural monument, and the authorities have confirmed that it's not a soldiers' memorial,"" says Marta Georgieva.
Not everybody supports the idea of dismantling the monument.
In fact, there are many people who believe it should rather be preserved: ""This is a joint memorial that must remind us that so many people died in this heinous, bloody and ruthless war — people who never wanted the war. Their memory must be kept alive,"" says an older women holding a picture of a relative who died in the Second World War. She is among a group of people gathered in front of the monument in Sofia at a commemorative event held on May 9, also known as Victory Day. Every year, the date marking the end of World War II is celebrated in different former communist-led countries.
In the eyes of those who commemorate Victory Day and wave Russian flags in the center of EU-member state Bulgaria, the monument serves as a symbol of the fight against fascism — a fight they feel is still ongoing, as different people told DW at the commemorative event, with some believing the ""West"" is the actual aggressor in the current war against Ukraine. 
Putin's propaganda narrative falls on fertile ground in Bulgaria, a country that has never completely escaped Russian influence. The country has not yet come to terms with its past. There is too little historical reappraisal, and too much disinformation. The horrors of the communist era were barely discussed for a long time, allowing problematic interpretations of the past to spread. 
A third option for the monument would be to turn it into a museum or relocate it to an existing institution, such as Sofia's Museum of Art from the Socialist Period, which displays various portrayals of Lenin, Che Guevara, Bulgarian communist leader Georgi Dimitrov and many other leaders from the communist past. 
""During that time, art had to serve propaganda. It became a tool of political power and ideology. The Communist Party melded with the state, and this one-party system controlled every sphere of public, political and cultural life. Art was not excluded from these processes,"" says curator Nikolai Ushtavaliiski. 
Ushtavaliiski has been director of the museum since 2011 and has followed the debate over the Soviet Army monument in Sofia with interest. But as the monument might not fit in the museum's football pitch-sized park, the curator points out that there is another location that is also being considered for it.   
The monument could be dismantled and relocated to the city of Dimitrovgrad, 220 kilometers (137 miles) from Sofia, he says. ""The interesting aspect there is that this city was founded in the early years of socialism. It was built out of nothing. Dimitrovgrad became a symbol for the construction of a new, socialist society in Bulgaria,"" points out Ushtavaliiski, who therefore feels that since ""Dimitrovgrad itself is a monument to socialism, a monument like the one in Sofia, which honors a foreign army, could find an appropriate place there.""

https://www.dw.com/en/netherlands-returns-stolen-artifacts-to-indonesia-sri-lanka/a-66143295,HISTORY,"Netherlands returns stolen artifacts to Indonesia, Sri Lanka 06.07.2023","The Dutch government has decided to return some 478 pieces of stolen art and cultural artifacts to the former colonies of Indonesia and Sri Lanka.
Most of these works are highly valuable and culturally significant, the Ministry of Culture said on Thursday in The Hague. 
It is a ""historic moment"" said State Secretary Gunay Uslu, adding that objects are being returned that ""should never have been in the Netherlands.""
The decision to return the objects was made after considering the recommendations by a government-appointed commission last year, which looked into illegal Dutch colonial acquisitions now being displayed in museums in the Netherlands. 
The commission was set up based on a request by Indonesia to return the art pieces and natural history collections from its former colonial ruler.
Some of the objects to be handed back include the so-called ""Lombok treasure"" — a collection of hundreds of precious stones, gold and silver objects, looted by the Dutch colonial army from Indonesia's island of Lombok in 1894. A part of this treasure was returned to Indonesia in 1977.
The cannon of Kandy, another highlight from the looted pieces, will also be returned to Sri Lanka. The ceremonial weapon is made of bronze, silver and gold, inlaid with rubies.
The barrel, decorated with the symbols of the King of Kandy, is believed to have fallen into Dutch hands in 1765.
Since 1800, the piece has been in the collection of the Rijksmuseum, the national museum of art and history.
A ceremony has been planned this week to officialy hand over the looted artifacts to Indonesia. 

The announcement by the Dutch government comes after the king's apology for the sufferings of hundreds of thousands of people under slavery. 
On Satuarday, King Willem-Alexander asked for forgiveness on the 150th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the Netherlands, which was one of the largest colonial powers from the 17th century onwards. 
Earlier this year, the Berlin Museum announced that it is ready to return hundreds of human skulls to the former German colony of East Africa. 
In 2021, France said it would return statues and royal thrones taken from the West African nation of Benin.
Last year, Belgium returned a gold-capped tooth belonging to the Congolese independence hero Patrice Lumumba.

https://www.dw.com/en/two-rediscovered-rembrandt-portraits-sell-for-11-million-at-auction/a-66111972,ARTS,Two rediscovered Rembrandt portraits sell for €11 million at auction 06.07.2023,"Almost 200 years ago, a British family bought two oil portraits by the 17th century Dutch master Rembrandt at a Christie's auction. Since then, the paintings have remained tucked away from the public eye, and were completely forgotten by scholars.
The portraits were among the highlights of Christie's July 6 Old Masters sale, part of the auction house's Classic Week. They were sold for 9.5 million British pounds (€11.1 million, $12 million), surpassing Christie's estimates, set between 5-8 million pounds.
 

The 20-centimeter-high oval paintings are Rembrandt's smallest known portraits. The rare and intimate portrayals depict an elderly plumber named Jan Willemsz van der Pluym and his wife, Jaapgen Carels. 
By 1635, the year the works were painted, Rembrandt had already been living in Amsterdam for a few years, and the successful artist was renowned for his large portraits commissioned by wealthy families.
The van der Pluyms were an affluent family who owned a garden next to that of Rembrandt's mother in Leiden, the painter's hometown. 
There were also family ties between the portrayed couple and the painter: one of the seven children in the van der Pluym family was married to Rembrandt's first cousin. Born from this union, the artist Karel van der Pluym is also believed to have studied under Rembrandt between 1645-1648.
An old friend of Rembrandt's, Lievens captured the painter known for his impressive self-portraiture. The two artists, friends since childhood, shared a studio in Amsterdam until 1631, when Lievens began to travel for his career. Rembrandt, in contrast, never went abroad, although he is said to have been inspired by the Italian masters




The portraits remained in the ownership of the van der Pluym family until 1760, when they were sold at an auction in Amsterdam. They then passed through various prestigious collections of European counts and barons before being auctioned at Christie's in 1824. 
The works were described in their listing at the time as: ""Rembrandt — very spirited and finely colored.""
Henry Pettifer, Christie's international deputy chairman of old master paintings, found the paintings during a valuation of the British family's art collection.
""The family liked the pictures but were never certain that they were by Rembrandt and never really looked into that,"" Pettifer told The Washington Post. ""They have been quietly sitting in this collection, effectively hidden away from any attention at all.""
""I was really staggered to discover that the pictures had never really been researched and never been addressed in any of the literature on Rembrandt over the course of 200 years,"" Pettifer told press agency AFP.
After discovering the portraits, authentication began using forensic work and help from art experts, including Amsterdam's renowned Rijksmuseum that holds 22 works by Rembrandt — the largest collection of his paintings in the world. 
Experts researched the line of ownership of the paintings and checked Rembrandt's signatures. After nearly two years of analysis, they concluded that the portraits were indeed Rembrandt works.
The newly discovered Rembrandts have been described by Pettifer as ""one of the most exciting discoveries we have made in the old masters' field in recent years.""
This is not the first time Christie's has made headlines for auctioning Rembrandt's rediscovered works.
In 2009, the auction house sold ""Portrait of a man, half-length, with his arms akimbo."" Painted in 1658, the work had been unseen in public for nearly 40 years and sold for 20.2 million pounds, which at the time was a record auction price for the 17th-century artist.
In 2016, Christie's negotiated a first-of-its-kind deal to sell two Rembrandt portraits from the Rothschild Collection to the Louvre Museum in Paris and  the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The coveted portraits had not been on display since 1956 and were also unknown works by the Dutch master.

https://www.dw.com/en/instagram-threads-10-million-sign-up-for-twitter-rival/a-66130805,TECHNOLOGY,Instagram Threads: 10 million sign up for Twitter rival 06.07.2023,"Tech giant Meta officially launched Threads on Wednesday, a rival to Twitter, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg reporting more than 10 million sign-ups in its first seven hours.
In his inaugural post on the app, Zuckerberg wrote, ""Let's do this. Welcome to Threads,"" accompanied by a fire emoji. 
Threads resembles Twitter in its format, allowing users to share short text posts, like, repost and reply to content. It does not have direct messaging capabilities.
Meta's blog post revealed that posts on Threads can be up to 500 characters long and include links, photos and videos up to five minutes in duration.
Although Threads launched as a standalone app, users can log in using their Instagram credentials and follow the same accounts, making it a seamless addition for Instagram's massive user base of over 2 billion monthly active users.
The app has not displayed any advertisements as of now.
Dubbed as the ""Twitter-killer app"" and ""Twitter's standalone rival,"" Threads is accessible in over 100 countries through both Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store, as mentioned in the blog post.
However, the launch in the European Union has been delayed over data privacy concerns.
Industry analysts say investors could be excited about Threads' potential due to its integration with Instagram, which may provide a built-in user base and advertising opportunities.
""It's as simple as that: if an Instagram user with a large number of followers such as Kardashian or a Bieber or a Messi begins posting on Threads regularly, a new platform could quickly thrive,"" strategic financial analyst Brian Wieser said on Substack.
On Wednesday, Meta's stock rose by 3% prior to the launch, surpassing the gains of competing tech companies, despite a slight downturn in the broader market. After attracting millions of users on Threads, Meta Platforms rose 1.8% on Thursday.
The arrival of Threads coincides with an ongoing exchange of jabs between Zuckerberg and Musk, with both even threatening to engage in a mixed martial arts cage match in Las Vegas.
The timing is favorable for Meta to deliver a blow to Twitter as months of tumultuous decision-making by Musk have plagued the social media platform.
Last October, Elon Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion, but the company's value has since plummeted due to advertiser exodus, substantial layoffs and content moderation controversies. Twitter's latest move involves restricting the number of tweets users can read per day.

Zuckerberg addressed Twitter's challenges in a Threads post, stating, ""I think there should be a public conversations app with 1 billion+ people on it. Twitter has had the opportunity to do this but hasn't nailed it. Hopefully, we will.""
The integration with Instagram incorporates various privacy considerations. Instagram users who sign up for Threads automatically have a badge displayed on their Instagram profile, but they can choose to hide it. The app also provides options for different privacy settings.
Prominent brands such as Billboard, HBO, NPR and Netflix swiftly established accounts on Threads, as did celebrities like Shakira, Kim Kardashian and chef Gordon Ramsey.
Responding to a user who predicted Twitter's demise shortly after the Threads launch, Zuckerberg advised patience, stating, ""We're only in the opening moments of the first round here.""

https://www.dw.com/en/david-adjaye-star-architect-accused-of-sexual-misconduct/a-66123815,CULTURE,David Adjaye: Star architect accused of sexual misconduct 05.07.2023,"Famed British-Ghanaian architect David Adjaye has been accused of sexual misconduct, according to a report by the Financial Times published on July 4. 
Accused by three women, all former employees, Adjaye has stepped back from a number of roles, while denying the allegations.
Adjaye was slated to help create a new Holocaust Memorial and Learning Center in the United Kingdom, and was a design advocate for the City of London. He has stepped down from both roles.
His commission to design a new national cathedral in Accra, Ghana has also now been called into question, as well as a museum of West African art in Benin City, Nigeria. The latter, known as the Edo Museum of West African Art, was set to house some of the Benin Bronzes that Germany returned to Nigeria in 2021.
The three women who have accused Adjaye were all employees of his firm. The claims were wide-ranging, encompassing ""different forms of exploitation — from alleged sexual assault and sexual harassment by him to a toxic work culture,"" according to their statement. The three women were not named.
The accusers have said the incidents, which allegedly took place in 2018 and 2019, have ""gone unchecked for years."" One incident allegedly took place in an airport bathroom in Johannesburg.
""I absolutely reject any claims of sexual misconduct, abuse or criminal wrongdoing,"" Adjaye told DW in a statement. ""These allegations are untrue, distressing for me and my family and run counter to everything I stand for.""
""I am ashamed to say that I entered into relationships which though entirely consensual, blurred the boundaries between my professional and personal lives. I am deeply sorry,"" he added. ""To restore trust and accountability, I will be immediately seeking professional help in order to learn from these mistakes to ensure that they never happen again.""
In addition to his roles with the British Holocaust memorial, Adjaye was previously honored with a knighthood and a gold medal by the Royal Institute of British Architects.
He also designed the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C.,  which former President Barack Obama referred to as: ""Genius, pure and simple.""
Adjaye's design for a museum to house the Benin Bronzes is particularly important in German political circles. Many of the historical items, despite having been officially handed over to Nigeria in 2021, are still housed in Berlin, on loan from Nigeria until the completion of the museum.

https://www.dw.com/en/david-bowies-journey-through-the-soviet-union-in-pictures/a-66068208,CULTURE,David Bowie's journey through the Soviet Union in pictures 04.07.2023,"David Bowie had just become a genuine global rock star. In 1972, he had his major international breakthrough with the album ""The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,"" and the world tour in support of the record continued until 1973.
The final date of the tour took place in Yokohama, Japan. Bowie, who suffered from a fear of flying, decided to take an unconventional route back home to England: going from Japan to Siberia on the passenger ship SS Felix Dzerzhinsky, then a week-long rail journey on the Trans-Siberian Railway, followed by further train connections through Poland, Germany and France. 
Now the late rock star's unusual trip through what was then the USSR is the subject of an exhibition titled ""David Bowie in the Soviet Union"" at the Wende Museum in Culver City, California. The Wende is an art museum, cultural center and archive of the Cold War, which, according to its website, ""explores social, political, and cultural change."" The photos in the exhibition are by Geoff MacCormack, a member of Bowie's band and a childhood friend.
MacCormack and Bowie met in the 1950s while playing in the London suburb of Bromley, where they both grew up, and they fast became inseparable.
In a video interview published on the Wende Museum website, MacCormack recalls growing up with Bowie, their time together at school, in the Cub Scouts and the church choir — and their trip through the Soviet Union. MacCormack describes vividly how the two boys fell under the spell of rock 'n' roll, calling it ""a force of nature"" that ""blew us away.""
They shared that love of music into adulthood. So when Bowie was about to embark on the 1972/73 tour, he recruited MacCormack as a backing vocalist, percussionist and dancer. ""He phoned me up and told me I was joining his band; he didn't ask me,"" MacCormack tells Joes Segal, curator of the Wende Museum, in the interview.
Aside from music, MacCormack's great passion is photography. And thanks to the closeness he shared with Bowie, he was able to capture images of the rock star on that train journey that others couldn't: a Bowie relaxed, lost in thought, focused, and excited by all the new experiences the trip brought them.
Traveling as they did allowed the two to really engage with the country and its people. There were repeated drinking sessions with soldiers, sailors and tourists; and the bleary mornings-after were captured by MacCormack's lens. He also recalls singing along with Bowie to an ever-present cassette of ""cheesy"" Russian cover versions of Beatles songs. 
One of the highlights of the journey was their two-day stop in Moscow, where they visited the Kremlin and the socialist showpiece department store GUM — and avidly watched the traditional May Day Parade.
The non-profit Los Angeles radio station dublab has created a playlist especially for the exhibition. It features songs from the time of that trip, as well as Bowie's once and future collaborators, including Mott the Hoople, Lou Reed, Brian Eno and Queen.
""This mix offers a glimpse into what he most likely was being influenced by at that moment, and later went on to define work such as 'Low' and 'Station to Station.' With a heavy dose of Krautrock, a foot in experimental music, and a solid presence in the so-called 'glam-rock' scene of that era,"" writes Alejandro Cohen, executive director of dublab, on the museum website.
The exhibition of MacCormack's photos is completed by Bowie's own 16mm film ""The Long Way Home,"" which captures several elements of the journey, including the visit to the Moscow May Day parade.
The photos on show are also collected in Geoff MacCormack's current book, ""David Bowie: Rock 'n' Roll with Me,"" published this year.
The exhibition ""David Bowie in the Soviet Union"" at the Wende Museum in Culver City, USA runs through October 22, 2023.

https://www.dw.com/en/sudan-conflict-what-the-gold-of-the-grandmothers-symbolizes/a-66099502,ARTS,Sudan conflict: What the 'gold of the grandmothers' symbolizes 03.07.2023,"At first glance, the painting shows colorful geometric squares. On closer inspection, they are houses of Sudan's capital city Khartoum — before they were destroyed.
Another artwork, this one a photograph, shows people in discussion, seated on plastic chairs under a large bridge.
And yet another installation shows the floor plan of a apartment building that has been squatted in, traced on the floor with adhesive tape, while photos hanging above it recall the lives of the refugee residents.
The seven contemporary artists from Sudan participating in the exhibition ""The gold of the grandmothers,"" currently on show at the Mouches Volantes art space in Cologne, use very different images, forms and motifs to represent the situation in their homeland. 
""Gold is more than just a precious metal in Sudan,"" explains Larissa-Diana Fuhrmann, who curated the show with her Sudanese colleague Rahiem Shadad. 
Gold is a highly-charged symbol in the African country, representing family tradition and identity. Husbands give their wives gold, which they can then pass on for several generations.
""If a woman has sold her gold, then her life has reached a low point,"" Fuhrmann adds. In other words, these are the people for whom misfortune is inescapable.
Now, all of Sudan has sold its gold. Since mid-April, weapons have once again become the main currency in the northeast African country.
The power struggle between rival generals — the leader of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, and the de facto head of state and army, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan — has turned into a war that is dragging Sudan, as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently lamented, ""into the abyss,"" and at a rapid pace.
According to UN Refugee Aid, more than 500,000 people have fled to neighboring countries, while more than two million people have been displaced within the country. 
""With the show, we want to draw more attention to the situation in Sudan again,"" says Fuhrmann, ""We're making a sign of solidarity to support the artists who are in exile or still on the ground.""
It's a goal shared by the project's supporters and funders — the Khartoum Downtown Gallery, the (currently closed) Goethe-Institut Sudan, the Goethe-Institut in Exile and the Goethe-Institut Bonn.
The exhibition features works by Amna Elhassan, who was also recently invited to put on a large solo show at Frankfurt's Schirn Gallery, along with art by Khalid Adelrahman, Reem Aljeally, Ala Kheir, Hashim Nasr, Waleed Mohammed and Mohammed Ohaj.
Some of the artists are making their first appearance here in Germany, for some it's even the first time in Europe. Most of them are now working from Cairo, Egypt, where they fled from the armed conflict.
""Unfortunately, media interest in the conflict is already waning again,"" warns Goethe-Institut representative Raoul Cyril Humpert.
DW has launched a new, Arabic-language radio program, ""Sudan Now,"" broadcast 30 minutes a day to the region.
""The situation of the people has come to a dramatic head,"" says Fuhrmann, who herself lived in Sudan for several years and is still in daily contact with friends in the country since the outbreak of the fighting.
Cultural treasures have been destroyed. The scene of brutal fighting for the first time included the long-spared capital, Khartoum. ""Rapid Support Forces fighters are entering homes and stealing residents' gold,"" Fuhrmann says. She speaks of a ""new level of violence.""
An improvised-looking pencil drawing by artist and architect Reem Aljeally, a student of the more famous Amna Elhassan, sums up the situation in her country: It shows a hand reaching into a wide-open backpack. It is filled with things that are currently needed to survive in Sudan: food, drink — and gold.
The exhibition ""The gold of the grandmothers"" runs from June 30 to July 21, 2023 in the art space Mouches Volantes in Cologne.

https://www.dw.com/en/marina-abramovic-peeling-potatoes-at-the-museum-folkwang/a-66082324,CULTURE,Marina Abramovic: Peeling potatoes at the Museum Folkwang 02.07.2023,"I am sitting at a large table in the Museum Folkwang peeling potatoes, together with Aleksandar Timotic, a 31-year-old opera singer from Serbia. He was selected to take part in the interdisciplinary performance course with  Marina Abramovic for a year. The world-famous artist joined the Folkwang University of the Arts in 2022 as Pina Bausch's first guest professor. A mountain of potatoes is piled up in front of us.
Timotic has time, as well as a potato peeler. He will sit at this table for six hours a day until July 9, peeling potatoes and singing opera arias (a self-contained piece for solo voice, usually accompanied by orchestra). He invites the audience at the Museum Folkwang to sit with him, listen and take up the potato peeler themselves.
""Are you hungry?"" is the name of the performance, which Timotic also describes as a gift of love to the audience.
He doesn't know yet whether he will last the six hours, he says. But Marina Abramovic has taught him to believe in himself. For a year, the globally renowned, New York-based artist taught the students via numerous Zoom conferences, but also during personal meetings to prepare the performances.












Abramovic put her students through a tough schooling, including a one-week ""Cleaning the House"" workshop in Greece.
""Cleaning the house"" is to endure physical privations as a means get to know oneself better. This training camp lasted seven days.
""Five days of it, there is no eating, talking is forbidden. Instead we do physical exercises to understand what time is, what presence means, and afterwards we worked on what can now be seen here as a result,"" explained Abramovic.
The six hours that her students now perform every day at the Museum Folkwang in Essen is not comparable to her own dedication, however.
Abramovic became famous for sitting on a chair for 600 hours for her retrospective ""The Artist is Present,"" at New York's Museum of Modern Art in 2010. For over three months, she invited people to take turns sitting opposite her while staring into her eyes without speaking or making physical contact.
The 76-year-old Abramovic herself can only watch the performances live on screen. For health reasons, she is currently unable to travel. Full of pride, she told how she tried to convey the expansion of the concept of art, the involvement of the audience, discipline and self-conquest to the students of the Folkwang University of the Arts.
The results will be presented to the public for the first time at the Museum Folkwang at the end of the fourth and final phase of work, from June 30 to July 9.
""In such long-term performances you can't pretend, you become vulnerable,"" she said. ""This creates a very emotional dialogue with the audience, which is something unique. And that's what the art students are showing now.""
A short time later, I am sitting on a chair again staring at a green wall. Behind me, Marija Radovanovic, dressed in a solemn green satin dress, is playing her violin.
""I wanted to create an opportunity for people to just sit there, without a mobile phone, just looking at a wall, resting their eyes,"" the performer explains.
She learned of art and sitting and contemplating at the ""Cleaning the House"" workshop. ""I would like people to sit in the chair longer here too and just listen, look and think,"" she says.
A classically trained violinist, Radavanovic was born in Belgrade in 2001. In her performance, she also reflects on the pressure of being a musician.
""Especially string players, when they don't do something well they always want to punish themselves, because perfectionism is so strong in this profession, including me,"" she says.
Like Radovanovic, most of the other performers do not come from the visual arts, but are singer, directors, dancers or photographers. Abramovic has taught them each a universal principle, which is to always test one's limits.

https://www.dw.com/en/juicy-red-sweet-sexy-strawberries-tempt-tongues-inspire-art/a-66037177,CULTURE,"Juicy, red, sweet & sexy: Strawberries tempt tongues, inspire art 02.07.2023","""Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields,"" begins the legendary 1967 song by The Beatles,  ""Strawberry Fields Forever.""
The refrain of Britain's most famous pop band continues to resonate whenever the word ""strawberry"" is mentioned. 
While officially credited to the Beatles' co-foundering duo John Lennon and Paul McCartney , singer and guitarist John Lennon wrote the song as a nostalgic tribute to the gardens of Strawberry Field, a Salvation Army charity children's home in Liverpool, near where Lennon played as a child.
Beginning in late 1966, the Beatles spent weeks in the studio, creating various versions of the track, culminating in a combo of them all: experimenting in alternating tempos, mood and musical keys. Cello, brass, flutes and the Indian swarmandal (a harp, or plucked box zither) were thrown into the mix. 
The song was released as a flipside to the band's ""Penny Lane"" vinyl take.
""Strawberry Fields Forever"" confounded band critics and fans alike but would ultimately shape the emerging psychedelic rock genre. Its accompanying promotional film is considered a pioneer in the music video medium getting off the ground at the time.
Originally writing the song on a film set in Almeria, Spain in September-October 1966, Lennon was allegedly influenced by his experiences with the hallucinogenic drug LSD while penning ""Strawberry Fields Forever."" Likewise, the line ""Nothing is real"" reflects the concept of illusion conveyed in the Hindu teachings Lennon was reading at the time.
According to music magazine Rolling Stone, Lennon considered ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" to be his greatest work.
Following Lennon's murder in New York City in December 1980, a tribute to the Beatles' co-founder was created in the Big Apple's Central Park – the Strawberry Fields Memorial – not far from the Dakota Building, where Lennon resided with his wife and artist, Yoko Ono, and where the songwriter was killed.
Meanwhile, the strawberry has also emerged as a sensuous and sometimes erotic symbol in art and pop culture. 
Take the 1990 film ""Pretty Woman"" starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, in which client Edward (Gere) offers up champagne and strawberries to call girl Vivian (Roberts) in a provocative scene in a swanky hotel. Vivian indulges in a sumptuous bite, yet retorts that this art of seduction won't work on her. She's too smart for that.
Why is it that the strawberry can be taken for sexual innuendo? What is it about the fruit that is so alluring?
The strawberry as a sexy symbol goes back to the Romans, Maitri Chand, a Mumbai-based psychologist and marriage therapist, told Cosmopolitan magazine in February 2023. 
""Strawberries as fruit have been historically associated with Venus, the goddess for love, sex, beauty, and fertility. They were also offered to people who were getting married as a gift to increase sexual pleasure."" This was due to their bright red color, intoxicating taste and tempting fragrance.
Wild strawberries are mentioned in the works of ancient Romans and praised as a gift of the gods. Poet Ovid distinguished between the ground tree strawberry, while fellow poet Virgil offered a warning to children picking strawberries to beware of serpents lurking in the grass.
Fast-forward to the late 16th and early 17th centuries, and you'll find the strawberry symbollically invoked throughout the works of William Shakespeare.
In the 19th century, the fruit featured in fairy tales by the German Brothers Grimm, including ""The Three Little Men in the Woods"" and ""The Hazel Branch.""
Charles Baudelaire, in his poem ""Les metamorphoses du vampire,"" describes a woman's mouth as ""red as strawberries."" 
German poet Paul Zech's 1930 ""Ich bin so wild nach deinem Erdbeermund"" (I'm so wild about your strawberry mouth), on the other hand, was a more pornographic verse about things below the beltline. The image has inspired songs by bands such as Franz Ferdinand, as well as providing the title to famous German actor Klaus Kinski's autobiography.
Alpine strawberries featured in religious paintings beginning in the late 1300s, and were often associated with the Virgin Mary and Baby Jesus. 
These include ""Madonna Among the Strawberries,"" painted around 1420, and the 15th century ""Madonna with Wild Strawberry,” where the fruit and its flower paradoxically symbolize both maternity and virginity.
The motif of the strawberry is found in paintings by artists ranging from Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai to Russian Zinaida Serebriakova, to Auguste Renoir and Marc Chagall.
British artist Lucian Freud created this 1950s work, aptly titled ""Strawberries,” as a gift to Ann Rothermere, who was Freud's patron and friend. It reflects both his fascination with the Old Masters, as well as the intensity of the strawberry imagery.
Equally riveting is the triptych oil painting on oak panel ""The Garden of Earthy Delights” by Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch, who lived from approximately 1450 to 1516.
The viewer detects the strawberry as the pinnacle in a surrealistic castle, while tiny people sit in a circle holding up the gigantic red fruit as several naked subjects are ensconced within an open strawberry.
The work typically relates themes if sensuality, desire and ""earthly delights” to the strwaberry, which is housed in Madrid's Museo Nacional del Prado.
People had been eating the much smaller, wild strawberries for thousands of years (and not just red ones, but white and yellow sorts as well), often for what were considered medicinal purposes. 
However, strawberries were not earnestly cultivated until the 1300s in Europe.
By the early 1700s, as world exploration and colonization expanded, travelers brought back plant and animal samples to Europe from all over the world. In the US, for instance, Native Americans had been enjoying strawberries for centuries.
It was a stroke of luck that strawberry samples that French naval engineer Amedee-Francois Frezier had transplanted to France from an expedition to Chile in 1712 were later crossbred with a variety brought back from Virginia, USA. This gave birth to a hybrid that would lay the foundation for the much larger, plump, heart-shaped garden strawberry we know and love today.
In May 2023, German environmental activists from the Campact group petitioned strawberry cultivation practices in Huelva, Spain, saying that strawberry farms close to the Donana national park had been illegally diverting water in order to irrigate their crops all year round. The environmentalists called on German supermarkets to stop selling these ""drought strawberries.""
Campact's petition stated that ""illegal water theft"" was threatening the ""fragile ecosystem"" of Donana national park.
Huelva, where the park is located, typically produces around 30% of the EU's crop.
The region is the largest exporter of strawberries in the world, a large volume of which goes to Germany.
Yet the love affair with the strawberry — which is a member of the rose family, high in vitamin C and is not actually a berry, but what botanists call a ""false fruit"" — is not likely to end anytime soon.
Legend has it that, in the French countryside, people served up cold strawberry soup as an aphrodisiac to newlyweds.
Old folklore also says that if two people break a strawberry in half and share it with each other, they will fall in love.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-2-teens-ecstasy-deaths-prompt-debate/a-66081319,SOCIETY,Germany: 2 teens' ecstasy deaths prompt debate 30.06.2023,"The two teenagers whose deaths have shaken Germany were only 13- and 15-years-old. They are believed to have taken drugs seeking to experience a 'high.' The suspected cause in both cases — which occurred within the space of only a few days — was an overdose of the drug methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as ecstasy (tablet form) or molly (crystal form).
Deaths following ecstasy use have happened before: The death of a young American woman following an ecstasy overdose in Berlin's famous Berghain nightclub in 2017 also attracted a lot of attention.
As tragic as every single death is, according to statistics from Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), ecstasy is in last place when it comes to deaths caused by illegal drugs. From 2020 until 2022, BKA statisticians recorded 27 cases.
Ecstasy is the third-most consumed illegal drug in Germany, coming in behind cannabis and amphetamines. According to the Epidemiological Survey of Substance Abuse in Germany (ESA), one out of every 100 people surveyed between the ages of 18 and 64 had consumed ecstasy in the previous 12 months.
The drug information website drugcom.de, which is run by Germany's Federal Center for Health Education (BZgA), strongly warns of the dangers of taking ecstasy. It points to deaths caused by ecstasy use as ""predominantly the result of overheating and the subsequent kidney or liver failure.""
The drugcom site makes clear, however, why partygoers in particular reach for the synthetic drug. ""Ecstasy has the stimulating effects of its parent substance amphetamine: people who take it feel alert and enabled."" Drugcom lists ""feelings of happiness and love"" or ""the feeling of closeness to other people,"" among the ""pleasantly perceived effects"" of the drug. Ideal for dancing the night away in clubs.
The dosage is what can make the difference between a poison and a medicine: this week, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published guidelines for research into psychedelic drugs, including ecstasy. The substance has for years already been used to successfully treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in military veterans. However, its administration is controlled, with safe dosages and without mixing it with other substances, which can be dangerous.
People who obtain the drug illegally do not have this security. In its latest report, released in mid-June, the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) noted that ""the overall strength of tablets available on the retail marketplace still remains high by historical standards.""
The European summer is the festival season. According to news agency reports, pills with the same imprint as those suspected of having killed the two girls — ""Blue Punisher"" — have already appeared at the popular music and arts festival Fusion, currently being held (June 28 to July 2) in the Mecklenburg Lake District northwest of Berlin. Partygoers have been warned. In Berlin, the new edition of the ""Love Parade"" event is scheduled to take place on July 8, with potentially hundreds of thousands of revelers, including massive levels of ecstasy consumption. Most would not know what exactly they are taking.
Since the beginning of June, people in Berlin intending to take drugs they bought illegally have been able to have the substances tested for free. After years of discussions and preparations, the so-called ""Drug Checking"" has begun. During this process, ingredients are analyzed for impurities. Results are typically available within three days.
""If we had already had blanket drug checking and it was widely communicated, that might perhaps have prevented the tragic accidents,"" toxicology and drug expert Fabian Pitter Steinmetz said, referring to the recent deaths of the two teenagers.
In Berlin, the demand for drug tests was so high during the first weeks of the program that many tests could not be conducted. The initial results: A third of the substances submitted so far either exceeded the expected dosage or were contaminated.
At least four other German federal states want to follow Berlin's example and introduce free testing of drugs. That could be possible via a new law, which should enable such initiatives to be launched nationwide in the future. The law has already been approved by the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, but still needs to be passed by the Bundesrat upper house.
Toxicologist Steinmetz also views drug checking as an opportunity to gain insights into the drug scene — above all, access to drug users. ""As a typical social worker or drug counselor, you never usually meet typical consumers of recreational drugs,"" Steinmetz told DW. ""The majority of the people who take these party drugs on weekends do not have a problematic consumption habit. Despite this, some guidance would also help them to avoid problems in the future and to minimize risks.""

https://www.dw.com/en/have-chinas-security-laws-changed-hong-kong-forever/a-66081635,POLITICS,Have China's security laws changed Hong Kong forever? 30.06.2023,"Three years after the controversial national security law came into effect in Hong Kong, previously known for its high level of autonomy and civil liberty, the city looks and feels very different.
Since 2020, more than 100 people have been arrested and imprisoned under national security charges, several pro-democracy political parties and large civic organizations have disbanded, and books and movies considered sensitive have been censored.
In the latest case, Hong Kong's Department of Justice attempted to ban a popular protest song from being circulated online.
Hong Kong's Beijing-aligned authorities maintain the law has brought ""stability"" back to the territory following the months-long citywide protest in 2019.
Some Hong Kong activists abroad, however, told DW the law has ""completely destroyed"" all forms of freedom and most civil liberties.
""We've lost our freedom in the parliament, we've lost our freedom in the judiciary, we have lost the freedom in choosing the chief executive, all forms of protests are now criminalized, and even soft expressions like movies and arts are now banned under the law,” said Ted Hui, a former pro-democracy legislator in Hong Kong who now lives in exile in Australia.

The dramatic changes that sent shock waves across Hong Kong began with the arrest and detention of prominent political and civil society figures, including 47 pro-democracy activists and prominent media leaders like Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai.
The crackdown expanded to other realms of civil society, including the forced closure of pro-democracy media outlets such as Apple Daily and the Stand News, and the removal of books on sensitive topics like the Tiananmen Square Massacre.
""This crackdown is a secondary-level autocratization that targets civil society and infiltrates everyday life,"" said Maggie Shum, a political scientist at Behrend College at Pennsylvania State University (Penn State). 
Kenneth Chan, an expert in politics at Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU), told DW that activities such as commemorating the Tiananmen Massacre or raising funds for NGOs or political groups have been banned.
""Hong Kong authorities have introduced new red lines to further strengthen control over all aspects of the city,"" said Chan.
Despite widespread criticism of the law, Hong Kong's justice minister Paul Lam said in a recent interview that the law hasn't affected citizens' freedom of assembly.
Last month, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee also refused to clarify whether attending June 4th commemoration events would violate the law or not. ""Everybody should act in accordance with the law and think of what they do, so as to be ready to face the consequences,"" Lee said during a regular press briefing.
With rights and freedoms that used to be guaranteed under the ""One Country, Two Systems"" vanishing rapidly in Hong Kong, Chan from HKBU said the current process is Hong Kong's ""second return"" to China.
In 1997, Hong Kong was handed over back to China by the United Kingdom. 
According to Chan, key institutions in Hong Kong are being stacked with pro-Beijing members, while the city's judicial system, which has long been known for its independence, is coming under increasing pressure.
""We are losing checks and balances and democratic guardrails that formerly existed in Hong Kong, and instead, there are more top-down networks,"" he told DW.
In 2021, Hong Kong approved amendments to its electoral system that allow pro-Beijing institutions to appoint most of the legislators while requiring all candidates to go through a vetting process controlled by a pro-government committee.
In April, the Hong Kong government announced that the electoral overhaul would be extended to the district council, where most seats are chosen through direct election.
On the judicial front, the law has allowed national security cases to be heard by government-appointed judges. The legislative council passed an amendment in May to grant the Hong Kong government the power to ban overseas lawyers from handling national security cases.
Shum from Penn State said China's ""hard-line campaign"" to crush any sign of dissent in Hong Kong has been ""very successful.""
""The Hong Kong government is now saying they want to plug the legal holes that exist in the law by passing Article 23 in the Basic Law,"" she told DW, adding that such a move would stamp out any form of collective actions to regain control in Hong Kong.
Last week, Chief Executive Lee told a local media outlet that Article 23 would be enacted in 2023 or 2024 at the latest.
""With this legislation, I hope the entire process will consist of careful and thorough considerations, resulting in a successful law,"" he told Hong Kong China News Agency.
The Hong Kong diaspora community has also become targets of crackdowns under the law. In April, a 23-year-old university student, who normally studies in Japan, was arrested over posts she shared on social media, which Hong Kong police described as ""inciting Hong Kong independence.""

Exiled Hong Kong activist Hui told DW that the incident has sparked widespread fear within the diaspora community, as overseas Hong Kongers begin to realize the potential risk of being arrested when they return to the semi-autonomous city.
""Nowadays, when Hong Kong people talk about returning to the city, they will talk about the potential risk of being arrested or having their passports confiscated by authorities,"" he said, adding that most Hong Kong people abroad will adopt precautions such as bringing spare phones when they are returning to the city.
Despite some overseas organizations' efforts to help sustain the resistance in Hong Kong, Shum from Penn State said the national security law is aimed at severing ties between the diaspora community and Hong Kong.
""I feel that in the long run, Hong Kong is going to become more isolated,"" she told DW.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-hostility-toward-muslims-is-widespread/a-66069446,SOCIETY,Germany: Hostility toward Muslims is widespread 29.06.2023,"A hostile attitude toward Muslims is widespread in large sections of German society. Its manifestations are an everyday reality. One in two people in Germany agrees with anti-Muslim statements.
These are the findings published this Thursday (June 29) by the Independent Expert Panel on Hostility against Muslims (UEM) in its final report, ""Islamophobia — A German Balance Sheet.""
The expert council was appointed after the racist attack in Hanau in 2020 and commissioned to conduct the study.
In more than 400 pages, the nine authors describe society based on scientific studies, police crime statistics and documentation of anti-Muslim incidents by anti-discrimination agencies, counseling centers and NGOs.

The UEM defines Islamophobia as ""the attribution of sweeping, largely unchangeable, backward and threatening characteristics to Muslims and people perceived as Muslim."" In this way, ""consciously or unconsciously, a foreignness or even hostility"" is constructed, which leads to multilayered social exclusion and discrimination processes, up to and including the use of violence.
Since 2017, explicitly Islamophobic crimes have been recorded separately in police crime statistics. Since then, 700 to 1,000 cases of insults, incitement and threats, damage to property and dangerous bodily harm have been recorded each year.
The report further indicated that across German society, Muslims are perceived [by non-Muslims] as ""lacking the ability to integrate"" and having tendency to consciously distance themselves and avoid contact with people of other faiths.
Muslim women who wear a headscarf report that they are often the target of public hostility. And there is widespread prejudice against Muslim men, who are believed to have an affinity for violence, extremism and patriarchal values. The researchers say that the equation of Muslim piety with fundamentalism is particularly problematic. There is even a willingness to advocate restrictions on Muslims' fundamental rights in the area of religious freedom and to deny them the right to equal participation.
The study also looks at Germany's political parties. In the Bundestag, the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) has ""a manifestly anti-Muslim program."" In the biggest opposition block — the center-right bloc of Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and regional Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) — ""latent hostility toward Muslims can be seen in the inconsistent recognition of Islam as part of the German nation or culture. The ruling center-left Social Democrats (SPD), Greens and the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) fail to fight institutional racism consistently. The post-communist Left Party is a notable exception.
Federal Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) described the report's findings as ""bitter."" She pointed out that among the approximately 5.5 million people of the Muslim faith and culture, most are German citizens.
""Muslim life is a natural part of Germany. We want all people in our diverse society to have the same opportunities and rights,"" Faeser said.
The experts make numerous recommendations: First, that all people and organizations in the country show solidarity. They suggest the appointment of a federal commissioner for combating hostility toward Muslims and recommend that a permanent council of experts be set up. They also say there should be more investment in establishing and expanding institutions that register and document complaints.
The experts recommend that the German government develop a strategy to promote the participation of people ""with Muslim identity references"" in all state institutions — with binding targets, and an investment into targeted public relations campaigns. There should be further training for teachers, educators and police officers, as well as for employees in the judiciary, administration, media and cultural institutions.
According to the recommendations, schools should be required to address the issue of hostility toward Muslims. The Conference of Culture Ministers calls on experts to ""revise curricula and textbooks across subjects"" to remove anti-Muslim content.
The UEM also sees deficits in the arts and culture scene. A comprehensive analysis of the portrayal of Islam in German-language movies, for example, shows that nearly 90% of them show a negative bias.
""The focus is on stories about terrorist attacks, radicalization, wars and women's oppression, narrowing the cinematic range of Islam themes to a few conflict and crisis topics,"" the report says, while the diversity of Muslim lifestyles remains largely invisible in German-language productions.
The German Islam Conference, which financed the work of the UEM, will now consider the final report of the expert panel, and a specialist conference is planned for the fall.

https://www.dw.com/en/arnold-schwarzenegger-biography-hits-the-shelves/a-62657028,CULTURE,Arnold Schwarzenegger biography hits the shelves 29.06.2023,"""Arnold,"" a new two-volume biography of Arnold Schwarzenegger by Dian Hanson, tells the life of the Austrian-born star in four parts: as an athlete, actor, American and activist.
To be published by Taschen Verlag on July 7,  the biography of the Hollywood star was presented to the public for the first time on June 28 at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles.
The work will be available in three editions, all limited, with exclusive interviews and never-before-published pictures.
While the collector's edition is the most affordable version at  €1,250 ($1,364), the 100 copies of the Annie Leibovitz Art Edition will sell for €12,500 each.
Only 1947 copies of the various editions will be sold in total, to celebrate the year Arnold Schwarzenegger was born.
Arnie, as he is affectionately known, was born on July 30, 1947, in Thal in the Austrian region of Styria. As a child, he was active in sports, including soccer, boxing and swimming.
At age 15, he first entered a weightlifting studio. Over the next few years, the young Schwarzenegger would spend most of his time fine-tuning his muscles.
""You have to train each muscle individually. It's like the precise work of a sculptor who works on marble with a hammer and chisel — not exactly like Rodin, but similar,"" Schwarzenneger told the German weekly Die Zeit in 2012.
In 1967, he became the youngest Mr. Universe. Starting in 1970, he earned the Mr. Olympia title — the most important bodybuilding award — six times in a row. He readily admits that he took steroids, adding that they weren't banned at the time.
When Schwarzenegger immigrated to the US in 1968, his impressive appearance soon caught the attention of the film industry. Known under his stage name, Arnold Strong, he got his first role in 1969 in ""Hercules in New York.""
At the same time, Schwarzenegger also found his way into the art scene and got to know Pop Art icon Andy Warhol. ""He was fascinated by my energy and my strength,"" the bodybuilder told Die Zeit. ""I worked as a model for him, and he introduced me to other artists like Jamie Wyeth and Laraine Newman.""
Schwarzenegger also recalled how Warhol introduced him to producers, fundraisers and actors like James Caan, Woody Allen and other influential people like Jackie Kennedy. Years later, Schwarzenegger would become part of the Kennedy family himself when he married Maria Shriver, the niece of former US President John F. Kennedy, in 1986.
Now well-connected, his film career took off in 1977. Schwarzenegger surprised critics by winning a Golden Globe for Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture for his bodybuilder docudrama ""Pumping Iron.""
In 1982, he became famous as ""Conan the Barbarian,"" and in 1984 he was offered the main role in a B-movie called ""The Terminator,"" which, in Schwarzenegger's own words, was ""a big challenge"" for him. Thanks to his convincing performance as the android killer, the low-budget production by director James Cameron quickly rose to cult status.
By then, Schwarzenegger was in high demand, and his earnings continued to rise. From the late 1980s until the early 1990s, he enjoyed a great deal of commercial success not only with action movies, but also with comedies like ""Twins"" and ""Kindergarten Cop"" alongside Danny DeVito.
Nevertheless, the hype had ebbed. After his third performance as ""The Terminator"" in 2003, Schwarzenegger said farewell to the film world and launched his third career, this time as a politician.
When he ran for governor in California in 2003, he brought along the sword he used to carry as ""Conan the Barbarian"" to Sacramento, presenting himself as the strong man the state needed to rescue it from heavy debt, while calling his political opponents wimps.
It took him a while, however, to get used to his new profession as governor. ""As an actor, you can rely on the screenplay, but a politician doesn't have one. Every day, every hour, it's incredible how many problems you're faced with — social welfare, poverty and overflowing jails. You wake up in the morning to 2,000 bush fires in California, or somebody is sitting in a prison cell waiting to be executed at midnight, and you get a call, saying, 'Governor, you could stop it,'"" he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in 2013.
Schwarzenegger, a Republican, is a supporter of the death penalty and turned down two pardon opportunities as governor before lethal injection was declared unconstitutional in California in 2006, effectively ending capital punishment in the state.
Following his two terms, he returned to familiar terrain and filmed yet another edition of ""Terminator"" in 2015.
A vocal critic of former President Donald Trump, Schwarzenegger took over the former president's casting show, ""The Apprentice,"" in January 2017, but dropped it after one season due to bad ratings.









But only one role has not been enough for the former politician for a long time. Above all, Arnold Schwarzenegger has made the fight against climate change his mission. In his speeches, such as at this year's Austrian World Summit, an annual climate conference in Vienna co-hosted by his Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative platform, he focuses on new technologies and urges a shift away from fossil fuels.
""We have blood on our hands,"" the ex-bodybuilder has said of Europe financing Moscow's war of aggression in Ukraine with its billions in payments to Russia for oil and gas imports.
He also doesn't mince words when criticizing politicians in his own country. In an emotional video released immediately after the storming of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Schwarzenegger called Trump a liar, a coup plotter and a failed leader.
""He will go down in history as the worst president ever,"" he said. He added, however, that America will come back stronger ""because we now understand what we have to lose.""
Austrian-born Schwarzenegger has come to represent the embodiment of the American dream like few Europeans before him. As ""Terminator"" (1984), he coined the legendary phrase ""I'll be back"" and continues to reinvent himself — including in print.

https://www.dw.com/en/india-struggles-with-quelling-ethnic-clashes-in-manipur/a-66059208,CONFLICTS,India struggles with quelling ethnic clashes in Manipur 28.06.2023,"Since early May, violence in India's northeastern state of Manipur between competing ethnic groups has left more than 130 people dead and led another 60,000 to flee their homes.
A recent spree of violence has left churches and temples damaged or destroyed, and lawmakers have also been attacked.
Two weeks ago, an office belonging to the minister of state for external affairs, RK Ranjan Singh, was vandalized, and a mob set his home in the capital, Imphal, on fire.
And last month, Vungzagin Valte, a third-time legislator from Manipur and a government adviser on tribal affairs, was attacked and is recovering from a head injury at a private hospital in Delhi.
The communal violence in Manipur erupted due to disagreements over access to educational, employment and other economic benefits.
The Meitei community, which accounts for over 50% of the state's 3.5 million residents, has demanded that it be recognized as a ""scheduled tribe."" The constitutionally defined status is a form of affirmative action intended to combat historical structural inequality and discrimination.
India reserves some government jobs, educational opportunities and elected seats for those categorized as ""scheduled tribes.""
The Meitei — a largely Hindu community — want access to the status. The Manipur High Court asked the government to consider the Meitei's demand.
In response, members of the predominately Christian Kuki and Naga tribes launched a protest against the possible extension of their benefits to the Meitei, who they believe are already the dominant community in the state.
The Kuki and Naga account for around 40% of Manipur's population and currently enjoy the scheduled tribe status, which gives them land-owning rights in the hills and forests that cover around 75% of Manipur.
Manipur's government is run by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Since the unrest began, hundreds of Indian civil society groups have joined in condemning the violence and urged Modi and the BJP to take action.
""Manipur is burning today in very large part due to the divisive politics played by the BJP. On them lies the onus to stop this ongoing civil war before more lives are lost,"" said a joint statement issued by the groups.
""Clearly, the role of BJP lies in using force and coercion to entrench its foothold in the state. Pretending to be an ally to both communities is only widening the chasm of historical tensions between them without any effort to facilitate a dialogue towards resolution,"" it added.
In June, the Indian government established a 51-member peace committee to address the violence in Manipur. However, the committee is proving to be a nonstarter, as organizations representing the ethnic groups have said they will not take part.
Its most prominent member, theater personality Ratan Thiyam, has said he won't be part of the committee, telling the Indian Express newspaper that his name was placed on the panel without his consent.
""There is so much violence and we are yet to hear a word from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We need political will and political power. So many people are dying even today. Unless the government comes to the picture, the situation will continue to be alarming. I have never seen such a situation,"" Thiyam said, as reported in Indian media.
Meanwhile in Manipur, both ethnic groups accuse state security forces of choosing sides.
In Manipur's valley country, predominately populated by Meitei, Kukis allege the state government and the police have been abetting Meitei mobs. In turn, Meiteis living in the hill county accuse the central government of going soft on Kuki militants.
Reports have also surfaced that the state police constabularies have provided security for Meitei militant groups to carry out attacks on Kuki villages in the foothills.
Suhas Chakma, director of Rights and Risks Analysis Group, an independent think-tank based in New Delhi, told DW that the BJP government should remove the chief minister of Manipur and deploy the Indian army to control the violence.
""What is essential is there should be serious dialogue for peace-building by appointing a group of non-partisan interlocutors, preferably from the northeastern region,"" said Chakma. ""However, no dialogue can be successful unless the modicum of measures to install a trustworthy state government is taken in the first place.""
Pradip Phanjoubam, editor of the Imphal Review of Arts and Politics, told DW that the deteriorating situation marks a failure of basic governance.
""The return of normalcy must be the priority and this initiative should begin from the leadership at the very top. Many now talk of an ethnic cleansing happening, and this may actually happen if nothing is done,"" he said.

https://www.dw.com/en/klimts-lady-with-a-fan-sells-for-over-100-million/a-66035875,CULTURE,Klimt's 'Lady with a Fan' sells for over $100 million 27.06.2023,"The last portrait Austrian artist Gustav Klimt painted before he died was sold at auction on Tuesday, fetching over $108 million (€98.5 million), according to Sotheby's auction house.
Bidding on the masterpiece far exceeded Sotheby's price estimate of $80 million.
Kilmt's untimely death at the age of 55, brought on by the influenza pandemic of 1918, meant that several of his works remained unfinished. The last one he did manage to complete, however, has become a collector's item.
""Dame mit Fächer"" (""Lady with a Fan""), a painting of an unnamed woman, was still on an easel in Klimt's studio when the artist succumbed to a stroke and pneumonia.
The prized item went under the hammer at Sotheby's Modern & Contemporary Evening Auction in London on Tuesday. Other artworks for sale the same evening included pieces by Pablo Picasso and Claude Monet, but both were  dwarfed in price by Klimt's portrait.
Even before the hammer fell, the estimated price tag made the work ""the most valuable ever to have been offered at auction in Europe,"" according to Sotheby's.
Other Klimt works have sold for more, however, including his 1907 painting, ""Water Serpents II,"" which reportedly went for $170 million in 2015 in a private sale.

""It shows Klimt at the very height of his creative prowess, drawing on imagery from Asia, of which he was obsessed,"" Helena Newman, chairman of Sotheby's Europe and worldwide head of impressionist and modern art, told the news agency Reuters.
Newman highlighted depictions of a phoenix, lotus flower and other elements in the painting, adding: ""It's very rare for a Klimt painting of this quality and caliber of a portrait of a woman to come to auction.""
The Sotheby's website is no less effusive about Klimt and his work.
""Gustav Klimt’s beguiling representations of women have made him the most celebrated painter of the female portrait in the early twentieth century. Klimt’s women constitute the most important group of works in his oeuvre and are among the truly iconic images of Modern Art.""
Last offered for sale in 1994, the painting is one of a small number of Klimt's portraits in private collections, according to Sotheby's.
Klimt's primary subject was the female body, however his portrayal of beauty and eroticism has not been without controversy. The paintings he completed around 1900 for the ceiling of the Great Hall of the University of Vienna were criticized for being pornographic.
University officials took offence at the amount of naked skin on show in Klimt's works, leading him to eventually withdraw from the project entirely.
Klimt never accepted public contracts again, and insisted on only painting for private clients.
A painting that had vanished in 1997 was discovered in the walls of the very gallery it was stolen from in 2019. The painting's disappearance had been one of the art world's biggest mysteries. ""Portrait of a Lady"" is a later work by the Austrian art nouveau master.

https://www.dw.com/en/international-african-american-museum-opens-on-historic-site/a-66014104,CULTURE,International African American Museum opens on historic site 26.06.2023,"The new International African American Museum (IAAM) was purposely built on pillars as a means of reconciling the trauma of the site's deep ties to slavery.
The vast institution was constructed on the former Gadsden's Wharf, a pier in Charleston Harbor in South Carolina where about 40% of all enslaved Africans set foot on American soil. It was one of the largest slave ports in the world.
From the concept to planning and finally the opening ceremony on June 22, completing this important cultural space took 20 years — due in part to funding issues, the pandemic and structural problems.
IAAM opens to the public on June 27, 2023.
The International African American Museum does not present a chronology of events but is designed to ""simultaneously hold the sensations of trauma and joy,"" explained museum director, Tonya Matthews.










Permanent exhibits, dozens of artifacts and more than 30 works of art honor the many thousands of Africans who were forced to leave their homes under barbaric conditions. At the same time, IAAM showcases the significant and important impact people of African background have on all aspects of contemporary US life.
""It's acknowledging that there were communities and civilizations and people that we were taken from,"" Matthews told CNN. ""It's also acknowledging that once we got to where we were, we also began to build communities and civilizations.""
The exhibition spaces in the $120 million (€109 million) museum feature both historic tribal and contemporary art, reflecting the work of many generations of artists.
In one room in the museum, black walls are engraved with African names like Wogue, Seesah and Eriyah, along with the person's age. Some slaves were just toddlers when they were forced to make the perilous journey from West Africa crammed into a ship's hold. Many did not survive the grueling journey.
One room over, names are also engraved on walls such as Linda, David and Hardtimes, even if these were the names the slaves were given upon arrival. The names were found in the freight and sales records kept at Gadsden's Wharf, which was built in the 1760s by then-Governor, Christopher Gadsden.
An estimated 100,000 slaves are said to have arrived there. Accessible to all, monuments dedicated to the slaves who landed there and those who did not survive the crossing have been set up at the historic wharf.
The Center for Family History is a special highlight. It provides a much needed resource for African-American families: Using sales contracts, property records and other records, people can trace their family history over several generations.
Specialized databases and experienced genealogists are available to help track down the names and histories of relatives. Some searches turn up long-hidden evidence of successful ancestral resistance that has awakened new pride in many a family tree.

https://www.dw.com/en/india-how-rohingya-children-are-learning-their-language/a-66035845,SOCIETY,India: How Rohingya children are learning their language 26.06.2023,"Ayesha Siddique, an 11-year-old Rohingya girl, rushed into her classroom. She picked up a broom, swept the floor and laid out a plastic mat in front of the small white board.   
Siddique's family fled Myanmar soon after she was born to escape the widespread discrimination and persecution of the Rohingya, a Muslim minority group in the Southeast Asian nation. They spent a few years in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar refugee camp before moving to India in 2019.
The young girl currently lives in a refugee camp in Faridabad, on the outskirts of the Indian capital, Delhi.
""My grandparents often describe Burma as a beautiful land with mountains,"" Siddique said, referring to the country now known as Myanmar. ""They told me about the trees behind our house, too. One day, I want to write a song about this in my own language.""
For the past month, Maulvi Mohammad Ismail, himself a Rohingya asylum seeker, began teaching children like Siddique how to read and write in their mother tongue.
In 2013, Ismail's family also fled to Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar, which is currently home to at least 1 million Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar. After five years, he and his family made their way to India.
They settled in the Faridabad camp, along with 50 other Rohingya families. The camp is located inside a garbage dump and most of the men work as ragpickers.

The people in the camp speak to each other in Rohingya. They're also fluent in Bengali and Hindi. However, most of them do not know how to read or write the script known as the Hanifi Rohingya.
The script was included in a 2019 upgrade to the Unicode Standard, a global encoding system that changes written script into digital characters and numbers.
The same year, Rohingya living in Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh started a WhatsApp group called the Rohingya Zubaan Online Academy. Ismail joined the group, downloaded the script, and spent a month learning the alphabet.
Last month, he set up a small classroom made of woven bamboo walls and a cardboard roof where he started teaching around 30 children between the ages of five and 15 how to read and write the language.
""When we fled Burma, we left with nothing but our clothes. The only things we carried with us from our home are memories and our language. It is important we learn and teach this to our children,"" he said.
Sabber Kyaw Min, founder and director of the Rohingya Human Rights Initiative in India, explained why it was so important that children learn the language.
""We as a community do not have much documentation. Our children must learn to write our language and then our stories, which will become our history. These stories should be translated and read. There is dignity in this,"" he told DW.
""Through these stories we can hopefully demand justice some day,"" he added. 
The Rohingya language remained an oral tradition until the 1980s when Mohammad Hanif, an Islamic scholar, developed a script based on Arabic letters and a set of decimal numbers.
The Hanifi Rohingya language is an eastern Indo-Aryan language. In Myanmar, it is spoken not only by the Rohingya community but also by certain Hindu and Buddhist groups.
Although the script of the Rohingya language was written in late 1980s, due to a military crackdown, violence and an internet shutdown, most of the population could not access it.
""What happens in any genocide is the systematic erasure of a cultural identity which had to be preserved,"" said Shehzar Doja, founder and editor of the Luxembourg Review. He is also the co-editor of the book, ""I am Rohingya: Poetry from the camps and beyond.""
The erasure of Rohingya culture began in 1964, when Myanmar's then military dictator, Aye Ne Win, excluded the Rohingya language from Burmese Broadcasting Service.
In 1982, the military government enacted the Citizenship Law, which excluded the Rohingya people from the list of recognized ethnic groups in the country.
From 1989 onward, the military junta undertook the mission of wiping away any traces of Rohingya cultural history. Restrictions were placed on practicing community traditions and the Rohingya population were violently evicted from their homes.
In 2017, Myanmar unleashed a violent military crackdown in what many describe as a genocide against the Rohingya Muslims in the country. This led to a mass exodus, with more than a million Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh and other countries.
Mayyu Ali, currently residing in Canada, is a Rohingya poet and author of ""Exodus: Between Genocide and Me.""
Ali himself learned the language in 2013 while working at a research center in Myanmar which had access to the internet.
""As a poet, it is very important for me to tell my own story in my own language. It is one the most powerful things to me,"" he told DW.

Ali was among the thousands of Rohingyas who fled to Bangladesh. While living in Cox's Bazar, he began The Art Garden Rohingya, a website which now brings together hundreds of Rohingya writers, poets and artists.
The platform, launched in 2019, also documents and preserves ancient Rohingya folktales, proverbs and riddles. They're published in Rohingya, Burmese and English.
Ali also explained that another factor contributing to the slow erasure of the language is that after fleeing, most of the Rohingya focus on quick assimilation into their host countries.
""While I was in Cox's Bazar, I saw my own friends trying to adapt to Bangladeshi culture and speak like locals as soon as possible,"" he said.
Reefa Akhtar, 10, and Abdul Shukur, 12, are two children studying Rohingya language in Ismail's class. When asked if they ever want to go home, both siblings immediately said, ""yes.""
However, Akhtar was quick to add, ""but I also don't want to go back to a place which makes my father sad even if he thinks about it for a minute.""
India is currently home to an estimated 40,000 Rohingya Muslims who escaped persecution in Myanmar.
Close to 20,000 of them are registered with the UN High Commission for Refugees, according to Human Rights Watch.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-prosecutors-confirm-last-generation-wiretaps/a-66025732,LAW AND JUSTICE,German prosecutors confirm Last Generation wiretaps 25.06.2023,"Munich investigators have been tapping various communications by the Last Generation climate activist group, Munich's public prosecutor confirmed on Sunday, following media reports about the surveillance.
This includes phones, emails, and voicemails linked to the group or some of its members, the prosecutor told German news agency dpa on Sunday. 
Bavarian authorities are currently investigating the group on the preliminary suspicion of forming or supporting a criminal organization. The investigation follows Last Generation's campaign of public climate-related protests, often involving either blocking traffic on roads or throwing liquids or paint on works of art, and more recently on buildings, private planes, and private boats.
Munich-based daily newspaper the Süddeutsche Zeitung first broke the story earlier in the week, saying the process had begun last October. It said the phone lines monitored included the climate activist group's press hotline. 
A spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Munich told DPA that journalists had not been targeted, ""however they were affected by the measures because of phone calls made to the monitored phone numbers."" He also said issues like the freedom of the press had ""of course"" been ""appropriately weighted"" when deciding whether to permit the wiretaps.
In some cases, the cell phones of members of the group were also monitored, as were email accounts, as well as the GPS location data on mobile phones.
This weekend, Last Generation issued a statement calling the monitoring unnecessary and dismissing criminal investigations against the group as baseless. 
""We protest giving our names and showing our faces, publish our plans, and accept the legal consequences,"" the group wrote on Twitter. ""Nevertheless Bavaria's LKA [regional criminal investigative police] protocols our telephone calls, emails and tracks our movements. Even our press phone line was spied on. That is absurd!"" 
The group's spokeswoman Carla Hinrichs also said on her personal social media account that details of personal calls, like comforting a friend after a breakup or telling parents personal news, were now being noted down in a public prosecutor's casefiles. ""That's my reality,"" she said. 
Lars Castelluci, a member of the Bundestag parliament with the Social Democrats (SPD), tried to argue both sides of the coin speaking to the Tagesspiegel newspaper about the issue on Saturday. 
""The concerns about a radicalization of the climate movement are to be taken seriously,"" he said. ""But the investigation into the possible formation of a criminal group should not be an invitation to enact measures that are themselves liable to radicalize the suspects."" 
Meanwhile, the leader of the post-communist Left Party, Dietmar Bartsch, alleged that the entire case against the group was an election campaign stunt emanating from the conservative state government in Bavaria. 
Bartsch called the wiretapping ""disporportionate"" and said it ""shows that it is wrong to politically influence our prosecutors' offices. They are being misused for the purposes of an inappropriate election campaign.""
Bavaria's next state elections take place on October 8. 

Bavaria's prosecutors launched criminal investigations into the group, including police raids against some members, last month. This received a mixed response in public, with some calling it an overreaction and others welcoming the move. 
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser recently said 580 potential criminal offenses had been attributed to the group or its members since the start of 2022, many related either to coercion (in this case usually in the form of delaying people on the roads by blocking their path) or to vandalism or damage to property.
Faeser, who is from the left-leaning SPD, had defended the police action against the group. She argues that some of Last Generation's protest actions had been disproportionate and even risked alienating people from the ecologist cause. 
Since the investigation has been launched, Last Generation has altered its protesting tactics to focus on less publicly disruptive targets — rarely gluing themselves to the roads or entering art galleries of late.
Instead, they have been spraying paint on public or commercial buildings, or on smaller private aircraft and boats, saying this is an effort to cause less disruption to ordinary people and more to more prolific carbon emitters in society.

https://www.dw.com/en/plastic-world-art-for-the-throwaway-society/a-66011549,ARTS,'Plastic World': Art for the throwaway society 25.06.2023,"Sneakers, dentures, computers — plastic is everywhere. Like a chameleon, it can go undetected, adapt to its surroundings, become invisible. And, of course, it's also used in the arts.
The virtually rotproof material's boom in the arts scene came in the 1960s, but it had already inspired avant-garde movements in Paris decades earlier.
The first sculpture made of plastic was created in 1916 by Russian sculptor Naum Gabo: ""Tete No.2"" (""Constructed Head No.2"") a cubist head made of rhodoid, a cellulose acetate plastic used to make dolls and billiard balls.
But not all plastics are the same. When Plexiglas, also known as acrylic, came out in the 1930s, new possibilities emerged, including for artists.
Bauhaus and other artistic movements of the era experimented with transparency and reflections.
The artists of the Zero group, including Otto Piene and Heinz Mack, benefited from the possibilities this new plastic offered in the late 1950s, experimenting with plastic films to produce their light sculptures. Any material was fine for his art, said Mack. But when designers also started using plastic for furniture in pop colors, he lost interest.
Plastic — whether hard or flexible, transparent, opaque, patterned, smooth, delicate or bursting with color — then appeared in various art forms and movements, including in pop art.
John de Andrea's 1978 female plastic nude sculpture ""Woman Leaning against the Wall"" is so realistic you want to reach out and touch her to confirm it's just a sculpture.
The boundaries between art and fashion blurred. Thomas Bayrle, an artist from the German city of Frankfurt, worked with a fashion studio to design plastic coats that were later sold at the Kaufhof department store chain for 25.50 Deutsche Marks (about €12, or $13).
Niki de Saint Phalle, famous for her gigantic ""Nanas,"" also gave in to the pull of plastic. In 1968 she created inflatable balloon Nanas. As beach toys, people could take them along on a vacation.
French Nouveau Realisme artists such as Christo & Jeanne-Claude, Cesar and Arman, were among the first to create artworks criticizing plastic as a symbol of consumerism and the throwaway society.
Arman created trash objects called ""Poubelles"" (Trash cans) in which he squeezed lots of plastic trash into a display case. ""As a witness to this society, I have always been intensely concerned with the pseudo-biological cycle of production, consumption and destruction,"" Arman said in 1973, adding that he was long been troubled by the fact that ""one of the most obvious concrete consequences of this cycle is to flood our world with junk and surplus rejects."" His words sound downright visionary today.
Arman's colorful hodgepodge of ""Poubelles"" was intended to contrast with the enthusiastic use of plastic in pop art. For example, US artist Claes Oldenburg created XXL soft sculptures meant to represent everyday objects. He used rigid polyurethane foam, a new material that came onto the market in the 1960s and excited the art world.
Lynda Benglis, another US sculptor, was on a different path, expanding the boundaries between painting and sculpture by ""painting"" with latex and pigments. Her sculptural ""Pools"" have an undulating, organic form that almost seems to be alive because of the flow and movement of the plastic. Benglis also created a series of works in molded polyurethane foam and plasticized paper.
The sculptures of Berlin-based artist Berta Fischer, born in 1973, are all about transparency and lightness. She creates ephemeral installations out of plastic foils, nylon threads or acrylic glass, with brightly colored, reflective or transparent surfaces that appear to be classy and cheap at the same time.
The ""Plastic World"" exhibition at Frankfurt's Schirn Kunsthalle museum, which runs until October 1, 2023, presents art ranging from the euphoria of pop culture to the futuristic influence of the space age and the trash works of Nouveau Realisme to contemporary eco-critical works.
The exhibition shows the allure of plastic and its drawbacks, emphasizing how ambivalent the material can be. Plastic is a curse and a blessing; it is indestructible, just like the concept of art itself.

https://www.dw.com/en/yoga-instructor-sets-out-to-decolonize-yoga-in-germany/a-65660389,CULTURE,Yoga instructor sets out to decolonize yoga in Germany 21.06.2023,"""Something is wrong here,"" Sangeeta Lerner thought to herself when she walked into a German yoga studio for the first time about a decade ago. Lerner had just moved from India to Berlin and wanted to get back to practicing yoga.
But her thoughts floundered in the Berlin studio: Why is the yoga instructor so fit? Why is the room decorated with a mix of Buddhist and Hindu gods that belong in a temple? And why was there superficial techno music playing during the final relaxation phase known as the shavasana?
""Everything was so sterile and fancy. Everyone had gym clothes on, while I had come in comfy clothes. The yoga teacher walked around the room correcting the asanas (or postures),"" Lerner recalls. She was irritated that she felt disconnected from the teacher and the other practitioners, since yoga stands for a sense of community. Lerner thought she was doing something wrong, that she was not flexible enough and that she needed more practice.
Today, ten years later, the 44-year-old knows she's not doing anything wrong, just like the approximately three million Germans who practice yoga regularly. Because it's not about right or wrong — it's about awareness.
""Yoga is not a sport, it doesn't matter what kind of body you have. Yoga is healing work — accessible to everyone. And for that, there must be spaces where everyone can feel welcome,"" Sangeeta Lerner tells DW.
Originating from India, yoga is closely linked to Hindu philosophy and practice. In western societies however, yoga is often taken out of context and commercialized.
Lerner sees this as cultural appropriation. Under British rule yoga was forbidden. Now sacred symbols and practices are unconsciously appropriated and dissociated from their Indian origins.
Sometimes everyday life doesn't provide enough opportunities to laugh, so laughing yoga makes up for that. The course starts with a rather artificial laughing exercise consisting of ""hohoho"" and ""hahaha."" Real giggling is supposed to automatically ensue. Laughing yoga, which eases tensions and strengthens the immune system, is the easiest form of yoga — and is a good option for beginners.




Yoga, as it is taught in the west, is mostly limited to the physical aspect of asanas or postures. There are also some bizarre forms such as beer yoga, yoga with goats or yoga on a stand-up paddleboard, which often includes the chanting of ""om."" Western yoga studios mostly mix esoteric ideas, far eastern philosophy and western psychology. Buddha is mixed haphazardly with religious songs of Shakti and Shiva which are Hindu gods.
""I'm not a Buddhist,"" Lerner explains, ""but these spiritual symbols are very meaningful to people in Asia.""
She observes how cultures are imitated yet not integrated in western yoga studios. It reminds her more of a kind of art performance. ""That's when colonial supremacy comes into play. You take something from a culture and make it work for you.""
Sangeeta Lerner was born and raised in Mumbai, India. The family didn't have much money, lived in a small apartment, and yet Lerner found her mother in particular to be a happy person. 
""My mother always gave everything. She welcomed everyone to our home and when she was out, she always had cookies for the street dogs. That was yoga for me. Not just physical exercise. My mother was very spiritual without being dogmatic. We all felt how good it was for her to give to others."" This feeling, she says, is what she misses in Germany and now wants to pass on herself as a yoga teacher.
Lerner used to work as a copywriter in the advertising industry. Among others, she worked for three years in Bahrain. This is where she met her future German husband, who worked in marketing. ""When I gave presentations, the men never gave me credit for my ideas. That's when I realized that as an Indian woman, I have no power in this country.""
She had always been someone who fought against social injustices, she says. To deal with all the chaos around her, including discrimination in her own country, she long sought answers in yoga.
Yoga is an Indian practice believed to be about 3,000 years old. The word yoga derives from Sanskrit and broadly means ""to unite."" It is an interplay of body, mind and breath, combining physical exercises, breathing techniques, meditation and ethical principles. So, it's no surprise to Lerner that yoga has become an export hit. ""It just works,"" she says with a knowing smile. ""Anyone who decides to become a yoga teacher isn't doing it to make money or become famous. They've realized it's a powerful practice that brings you closer to your soul."" It was also the reason why she turned her back on the advertising industry.
The global yoga industry generates €35 billion (almost $38 billion) from classes, retreats, yoga gear, books, magazines and scented sticks, according to market research firm Allied Market Research.
Yoga in the west is often advertised by predominantly slender, white people. This reinforces stereotypical ideas and excludes people who do not conform to this beauty norm.
Yogini Sangeeta Lerner bought her first yoga mat in Germany. After numerous further training courses, she gathered the courage to offer her own yoga classes. However, not in a yoga studio, but in a family center and in a midwife's practice.
She shows up wearing loose colorful pants and a blouse. Again and again, she directs her attention to the breathing, and asanas happen as if in passing. She keeps the exercises simple without contortions. A meditative state is quickly attained.
Although people worldwide follow the spiritual practice and appreciate it, the Berlin-based yoga teacher is annoyed that it doesn't help to prevent prejudices against Indians.
""I still get the stereotypes of cows in the street or snake charmers,"" she says. Her two children also have had racist experiences, she says. ""India is a big country and we also have many political problems. But instead of talking about it, we keep getting pigeonholed.""
To change that, Sangeeta Lerner has been giving Decolonize Yoga workshops throughout Germany for the past two years where they learn how to teach yoga without being culturally appropriative. Both experienced yoga teachers and beginners attend these two-day workshops.
""Are you taking yoga away from us now?"" is one of the questions Lerner often hears. ""Of course not!"" is her answer. As someone who grew up with it, she mainly wants to create awareness of its complexity and pass on its cultural roots.
""We all live in toxic cultures, whether in Germany or India,"" Lerner says. Her aim is to bring yoga out of the privileged, commercialized environment and into the mainstream. She has already succeeded on a small scale. She is nicknamed the 'Mayor of the Schillerkiez' in her neighborhood, Berlin's Neukölln district, where everyone knows and greets her. There's a sense of community, just like she learned from her mother.

https://www.dw.com/en/10-things-about-the-titanic-you-probably-didnt-know/a-61368562,CULTURE,10 things about the Titanic you probably didn't know 21.06.2023,"Many myths and legends have circled around the Titanic up to this day, contributing to an ongoing fascination for the wreck. For decades, it has also drawn wealthy tourists to travel to the remains of the liner for themselves — an expedition that is not only expensive, but also dangerous, and now a submersible vessel carrying five people has gone missing.

The RMS Titanic was supposed to be a triumph of engineering. Built in Belfast, the ship was the largest in the world in its day. In 1912, the luxury liner set out on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England to New York City. People had clamored to reserve places onboard.
The prices of first-class tickets varied, with the cheapest costing 30 pounds, the equivalent of about €4,000 ($4,330) today. Many of the guests could certainly afford it — wealthy passengers included real estate mogul and hotel owner John Jacob Astor, one of the richest men in the world at the time, as well as businessman Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress. They all wanted to make history as the first passengers on the Titanic.
Others saw the crossing as a chance to find a better life in North America. Little did anyone know, the Titanic would never reach its final destination. On the night of April 14, 1912, the steamer hit an iceberg, and the maiden voyage ended in disaster.
Here are 10 facts about the Titanic you might have missed.
On the fateful night of April 14, sailor Frederick Fleet was on lookout duty. He was an experienced sailor who had been sailing since the age of 12. It is said to have been bitterly cold in the crow's nest that night when Fleet saw a dark mass in the water — the first spotting of the iceberg — and reported the danger to his superiors. The first officer responded promptly, but it was too late.
Fleet survived the disaster and later stated for the record that he had not had binoculars. The binoculars were in a locked cabinet, and the keys had been left with an officer who was not onboard the ship. Part of the crew had been replaced shortly before the first Atlantic crossing, and this officer was among those replaced. He must have forgotten to leave the key on the ship.
Once the Titanic hit the iceberg and it was clear the ship would sink, chaos reigned, and the air was filled with fear and the screams of passengers scrambling to board lifeboats.
The liner's musicians, however, decided to play on the deck of the luxury liner. For more than two hours after the collision, the band was still trying to calm down the frightened people onboard. All eight musicians lost their lives in the accident. This moving gesture by the band can be seen in director James Cameron's 1997 cult film ""Titanic.""
None of the engineers on the Titanic survived. Captain Edward John Smith is said to have encouraged his crew with the words, ""Be British, boys, be British.""
Other men, including from the first class, also preferred to die with honor. Businessman Benjamin Guggenheim is reported to have said, ""We've dressed up in our best and are prepared to go down like gentlemen."" Real estate mogul John Jacob Astor also is said to have wryly remarked, ""I asked for ice, but now this is ridiculous."" He helped a young woman and a child emigrant into a lifeboat.
Of the approximately 2,240 passengers, only 700 survived the disaster.
The sea that night had a temperature of around 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit), a temperature in which a person could normally only survive for a maximum of 15 minutes.
Charles Joughin, the chief baker on the Titanic, is one of the most famous survivors of the disaster. Although he was chosen as the captain of one of the lifeboats, he decided to give up his place since there were already sailors on the lifeboat to steer it.
Joughin went down with the sinking ship but drank so much alcohol beforehand that he no longer felt the cold of the water in which he floated. After spending two hours swimming in the water, he was pulled onto an overturned lifeboat and was eventually picked up by a rescue ship.
The love story of Rose and Jack featured in James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is pure fiction. But there were lovers on the Titanic who suffered a tragic end.
One example is the co-owner of the American department store Macy's and his wife: Isidor and Ida Straus. They had spent the winter in Europe and were on their way back home to New York. Both were offered a seat in a lifeboat, but Isidor refused — as long as children and women were still on the sinking ship, he did not want to get on.
His wife Ida, in turn, did not want to be rescued without her husband and is reported to have said, ""I will not be separated from my husband. As we have lived, so will we die, together."" Several plaques commemorate the couple who chose to share death, including one at Macy's department store in New York City.
The ship should have had 32 lifeboats, and while the initial designer planned for this, the shipping company was convinced that the liner was safe and that having more lifeboats would just needlessly take up space on the decks. On a ship like this, comfort was of the utmost importance.
The company actually did not violate any safety laws, because according to the regulations of the time, the number of boats was based on the weight of the ship, not on the number of passengers. It was a fatal calculation. With the 16 lifeboats and four folding boats that were onboard, only 700 people could be rescued.
Perhaps before naming the steamer Titanic, the White Star Line shipping company should have read author Morgan Robertson's book ""Futility,"" published in 1898.
The novel told the story of a large and luxurious ship called the Titan that hits an iceberg while sailing between the US and England — just like the Titanic in real life.
Many individuals set out to find the sunken Titanic, but it was not until 73 years after the disaster, in 1985, that underwater archaeologist Robert Ballard succeeded in locating the wreck in the North Atlantic and photographing it for the first time. He financed this endeavor by agreeing to search for the remains of two sunken submarines in a secret US Navy mission. He then had 12 days in which he was allowed to use Navy equipment to find the Titanic.
At a depth of 3,800 meters (12,470 feet), in eternal darkness, he found the wreck of the former luxury liner. The find came just in time, as microbes had already settled onto the shipwreck and begun decomposing the Titanic piece by piece; it will eventually become dust. Scientists suspect that the wreck will be gone by 2030. Yet the legend will certainly remain.
The best-known film adaptation of the Titanic story is probably James Cameron's 1997 box-office hit. The film is considered one of the most successful films in movie history — it won 11 Oscars.
But there were also other film adaptations. The first was made in 1912, the same year the steamer went down. It was entitled ""Saved From the Titanic,"" and the main role was played by a survivor of the disaster.
A Titanic film was also made in Germany during World War II, but the Nazis used this film version as a propaganda tool against the US and the United Kingdom.
Since 1912, many passenger ships have cruised the Atlantic, and the Titanic has long since been overtaken in size by countless other vessels. The largest cruise ship, launched in 2022, is called Wonder of the Seas. It has a width of 66 meters (216 feet), compared to the Titanic's 28 meters. There is also a clear difference in height: the Wonder of the Seas measures 72.5 meters and the Titanic just 53 meters.

He would never have dreamed that this ""everyday music"" would one day become pieces for eternity.
To commemorate Bach's 300th anniversary as church cantor, the cantatas were the focus of the Leipzig Bach Festival, which was held from June 8-18. 
Under the motto ""Bach for Future,"" more than 70,000 visitors from 56 countries came — a new international record for the festival, which scores points for its original venues from Bach's time. ""The more international the festival, the younger the audience,"" Bach festival director Michael Maul told DW. ""I am therefore not worried about the future of his music. Bach is present all over the world and attracts people to Leipzig like never before.""
To close the festival, Bach's acclaimed Mass in B minor was heard in St. Thomas Church, performed by the Bach Collegium Japan, under the direction of Masaaki Suzuki.
In 2015, Bach's personal handwritten manuscript of the mass held by the Berlin State Library was included in the UNESCO's Memory of the World Register, a project to protect and preserve culturally significant documents and manuscripts.
Johann Sebastian Bach came to Leipzig at the age of 38 as the new Thomaskantor and municipal music director. He not only composed church cantatas for Sunday services, but also directed the ""Thomanerchor"" (St. Thomas Boys' choir), which was founded in 121 and remains one of the most famous boys' choirs in Germany. Bach also oversaw the maintenance of the instruments and played at weddings and funeral services.
In his first year of office, Bach invested much energy into his cantatas.
At the Bach Festival, four of the best Bach connoisseurs performed favorite cantatas with their ensembles, including conductors Philippe Herreweghe and Ton Koopman, who are known for historical performance practice and whose concerts can be heard on the ""DW Classical Music"" YouTube channel.
In his music, Johann Sebastian Bach created new musical forms with unfamiliar instruments and artful sound mixtures, which today are often described as atmospheric or celestial. The composer placed particular emphasis on setting the texts and biblical words of his cantatas in a musically expressive manner.
""The cantatas are perhaps Bach's most complex and difficult music to access,"" says artistic director Michael Maul. Even for Germans, he says, there are language barriers with the cumbersome baroque texts. Moreover, people are no longer as God-fearing as they were in Bach's time. ""Nevertheless, Bach is received across denominational, cultural and geographical boundaries.""
Contemporaries at the time did not yet recognize Bach's genius. ""Bach is so much more difficult to play than the music of his contemporaries. It is also more complex to grasp that people back then may simply have been overwhelmed,"" Maul says.
Bach is also said to have expected too much of his Thomaner boys at times. He complained to the council about the caliber of the boys who had been chosen, and after a few years — also because of other differences with the city council — he increasingly turned to secular music.
He created instructional pieces such as ""The Art of Fugue"" (1751) and composed well-known works such as the ""Goldberg Variations"" (published in 1741), which the Armenian pianist Sergei Babayan played from memory with virtuoso precision at the Bach Festival.
The St. Thomas Boys Choir was in particularly high demand this year. For the opening concert, it not only performed Bach's inaugural cantata ""Die Elenden sollen essen"" (""The miserable shall eat""), but also a world premiere by conductor, clarinetist and composer Jörg Widmann, who took the cantata form as a basis to speak about war and the hope for peace.
For Thomaskantor Andreas Reize, looking back, it was the biggest challenge of the 300th anniversary celebration. ""We went beyond the limits of what we could do in the premiere, but it was an incredible experience,"" Reize says. ""It was very difficult to sing, incredible for the orchestra to play, and also for me to conduct.""
The Thomaner were awarded the Bach Medal for their services to the works of Johann Sebastian Bach.
Among the noted guests at St. Thomas Church for the ""Boys' Choir Summit"" was English rock legend Sting, a reputed Bach lover. Bach festival director Michael Maul also happens to know that every now and then, Sting plays a few bars of Bach on his guitar.
Johann Sebastian Bach's inauguration in Leipzig will be celebrated throughout this year.
For example, the St. Thomas Boys' Choir will participate in weekly Sunday services, at which the same musical programs will be heard as in Bach's day.
The Bach Museum will be showing the special exhibition ""Bühne frei für Johann Sebastian Bach!"" (""Make way for Johann Sebastian Bach!"") until March 2024. Divided into three successive parts, the exhibition will focus on Bach's church music, his music for keyboard instruments, and how subsequent generations have dealt with his music.
Under the motto ""Choral Total,"" the Bach Festival 2024 (June 7-16) will host Bach ensembles from around the world to sing Bach's choral cantatas from his second year in office as Thomaskantor (1724/25). In addition to German and European choirs, ensembles from the US, Japan and Malaysia, among others, are expected. There will also be a festival choir, to which singers from all over the world can register.

https://www.dw.com/en/how-the-sound-of-music-changed-prehistoric-societies/a-65939873,SCIENCE,How the sound of music changed prehistoric societies 19.06.2023,"Between 10,000 and 12,000 years ago, Stone Age humans started transitioning from hunter-gatherer to town-dwelling farming societies.
Human culture changed forever, with art, music and rituals at the heart of the shift, offering new ways to bind people together in shared religion and purpose.
But while symbolic cave paintings and ornamental jewelry survived for us to see for ourselves, music and dance faded away.
Now, archaeologists in Israel have discovered a set of 12,000-year-old Paleolithic musical instruments from the Natufian people. The flutes mimic the sound of falcon calls and could have been used in spiritual music rituals.
Replicas of the flutes offer insight into what they sounded like. Spoiler alert, it might set your teeth on edge.
""It was really nice when we first heard it — it's a sound from 12,000 years ago,"" study lead author Laurent Davin, an archaeologist at the French Research Center in Jerusalem, Israel, told DW.
Living 15,000 to 10,000 years ago, the ancient Natufian people were at the forefront of humanity's shift to agriculture.
Early humans had been following the seasons and hunting stock for hundreds of thousands of years, but the Natufians were some of the first people to show sedentary traits, staying in one place to form farming and herding societies.
""They lived in open-air settlements but also used caves for specific, most probably cultic/public activities. This is the first society to have solid, stone-based architecture, and not less important, the first graveyards, with special treatment of the dead,"" said Anna Belfer-Cohen, a Paleolithic archaeologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel.
Archaeological evidenceshows Natufians buried leaders and shamans in elaborate gravesites rich with offerings of eagle's wings and other animal remains. This special, ritualistic treatment of the dead and their graves would become one of the most important developments in human culture — religion and spirituality.
Researchers believe that music and art allowed the voices of the dead and animal spirits to be heard and re-heard through rituals passed through generations.
Over time, their stories became mythologized, blending with tales of genesis and heroism as well as music and artistic symbolism used to metaphorize the deeds and characters of great people.
Some even became gods that bound societies together around central authoritative figures.
""I am sure music played a dominant role in the life of the people from the very beginning, even when the findings relevant to this are unfortunately rare,"" said Belfer-Cohen.
While the cultural importance of music was well-established in Stone Age society, Davin's study, published in Scientific Reports, offers the first concrete evidence that Natufians were musical.
Excavations at Eynan-Mallaha near the Sea of Galilee unearthed over 1,100 bird bones from the settlement dating between 10,730 and 9,760 BCE. Davin and his team reanalyzed the bones, finding many were actually ""aerophones"", or small, flute-like instruments. 
While not the oldest instruments ( 40,000-year-old-flutes were once found in Germany), they are the oldest found in the Levant.
The Natufian flutes were all made of wing bones of small birds like the Eurasian Teal, Eurasian Coot and ducks and mallards. The flutes are tiny — 6 centimeters (2.3 inches) long and 1 centimeter wide. Each flute has between one and four finger holes as well as a mouthpiece.
Curious what the instruments sounded like, Davin and his team reproduced three of the instruments made from the wing bones of two female mallards.
The tone produced is a high-pitched note that sounds almost like a bird of prey. Speculating the flutes could have been used to imitate bird calls, the team played the instrument and analyzed the sound. They found that the sounds produced by the replica flute were remarkably similar to the calls of kestrels and sparrowhawks.
""It was a complete match. So the idea is that the flutes were made to imitate the calls of falcons,"" said Davin.
The authors think the use of small bird bones was deliberate. Though more difficult to play, narrower diameter wing bones produced the required high-pitched sound.
""They could have used bones from bigger bones, but they didn't, probably because they knew the thinner the bone, the higher the pitch of the tone. They probably had some knowledge of acoustics,"" Davin told DW.
The Natufian flutes all had traces of contact wear around the finger holes, indicating people had played the instruments. But what were the flutes used for? Davin and his team can only speculate, but it's possible the flutes were used in rituals with spiritual or quasi-religious meaning.
Davin points to contemporary evidence of the symbolic meaning of birds.
The Plains Indians in North America, for example, held communal religious ceremonies in which they blew similar whistles made from eagle bones decorated with feathers. Similarly, Kaluli people in Papua New Guinea wear the feathers of rainforest birds which are considered to be spirits.
""The plains Indians want to communicate with eagles to take their strength. The relationship is symbolic,"" said Davin.
Another idea is the flutes were used for hunting falcons, or even hunting with falcons using falconry.
""These are people who were also hunters. Another function of the flutes offered by the authors is that they could have been used to trap or hunt birds — maybe not for their flesh but for their feathers and claws,"" said Belfer-Cohen.
It's clear that animals had tremendous spiritual importance for early Neolithic and Palaeolithic societies. Music and art were used to metaphorize the spirits of animals, the hope being to call upon their strength, both in life and death.
""People were dependent upon their immediate surroundings and special ties with the natural world around them. Association with animals could be observed in the Paleolithic most obviously through the art produced, like what humans depicted on the walls in the times of the Upper Paleolithic on the walls of the Franco-Cantabrian regions (France and Spain),"" said Belfer-Cohen.
And we still see the roots of these animal metaphors today in the flags of countries and sports teams with eagles and lions, in the pseudoscience of zodiac signs written in daily newspapers and in descriptions of people as cheeky monkeys or sly foxes.

The survivor said that McGregor ""violently"" assaulted her in the bathroom during a match between the Miami Heat and the Denver Nuggets that took place last Friday, reported ESPN and TMZ Sports who cited letters from the woman's attorney.
The NBA and the Miami Heat have opened investigations into the allegations against the UFC champion.
McGregor allegedly ""aggressively kissed"" the woman before attempting to force her into multiple sexual acts.
The survivor has provided the Miami police with the clothing she wore that night and a report was filed, said her attorney Ariel Mitchell.
In a statement released by McGregor's attorney Barbara Llanes on behalf of the Irishman he called the allegations ""false"" and said that he ""will not be intimidated.""
The Miami Heat said that they are conducting a ""full investigation."" The NBA also said that they're looking into the allegations and working with the Heat to gather information.
McGregor's conduct at Friday's game had already come under scrutiny after an incident during the match's timeout hour.
The mixed martial artist punched a Miami Heat mascot after the mascot appeared on court for a pre-planned promotional gimmick. The employee who posed as the mascot was taken to the hospital after the attack.
McGregor is one of the biggest stars on the mixed martial arts circuit.
He hasn't fought since 2021, after he injured his leg during a match. His last win was in January 2020.
Previously, McGregor has been accused of sexual assault four times but never convicted, reported ESPN. He has also been accused of getting violent, making racist comments and homophobic slurs.

https://www.dw.com/en/louvre-museum-exhibits-icons-from-ukraine/a-65897559,ARTS,Louvre museum exhibits icons from Ukraine 15.06.2023,"A new exhibition in the Parisian Louvre museum called ""The Origins of the Sacred Image"" will showcase five of 16 works that were rescued from war-torn Ukraine: four icons from the 6th and 7th century — encaustic paintings on wood from Saint Catherine’s Monastery on the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt — and one micro-mosaic icon from the late 13th or early 14th century from Constantinople, with a lavish gold frame.
Icons are portraits of holy persons in the Christian Orthodox faith. They are predominantly found in Eastern European churches. The oldest surviving examples date from the 6th-7th centuries, such as the icons that will be on display in the Louvre museum. They are considered major milestones in the history of art.
""Since the start of the war, like other museums, we have been concerned to see how we can support our Ukrainian colleagues. In the autumn, faced with the intensity of the conflict, we decided to carry out this rescue,"" Louvre president Laurence des Cars told press agency AFP. ""It's not much in a sea of sadness and desolation, but it's a symbol,"" she added.
She said the Louvre was particularly concerned by the risk of theft and illicit trafficking that could have affected artworks and relics if they had stayed in Ukraine. 
Eleven other works, ""among the most emblematic and most fragile"" from the Ukrainian collection, will be housed in the Louvre's reserves ""until the situation improves,"" according to the Paris museum.
The icons, representing both the foundations of Byzantine civilization and its innovative relationship to images, hold numerous mysteries yet to be unraveled. This is why the Louvre has created an international committee, consisting of Ukrainian scientists and renowned specialists in the field, to conduct in-depth analysis and study, shedding light on the significance of these works. 
The art treasures were brought to France via Poland and Germany on May 10 under military escort and with help of the International Alliance for the Protection of Heritage in Conflict Areas (ALIPH).
Earlier this month, a rocket landed near the Khanenko Museum, blowing out the windows. Since the beginning of the Russian invasion, its collection has been moved to safety and the building is currently empty.
Already in October 2022, the historic building and its interior decorations were damaged by a missile strike. The remaining artworks are now at risk from temperature variations caused by power cuts. 
The Bohdan and Varvara Khanenko Museum encompasses some 25,000 works of ancient art, Byzantine, European and Asian art. 
Its collection owes its origin to the vision and passion of Bohdan and Varvara Khanenko, two 19th-century Ukrainian entrepreneurs, art lovers and philanthropists.
The couple enriched their collection over the course of four decades, traveling around the world. They made their first purchases during their honeymoon in Italy in 1874. From the very start, their desire was to assemble an eclectic collection for themselves, driven by the ultimate goal of making it accessible to as many people as possible.
Having survived the First and Second World Wars, the Khanenko Museum is now experiencing the third war in its history.

https://www.dw.com/en/germany-fails-to-fully-confront-colonial-legacy-in-tanzania/a-65862738,POLITICS,Germany fails to fully confront colonial legacy in Tanzania 14.06.2023,"An impressive, yet painful reminder of the ups and downs of German-Tanzanian relations can be found in the Museum of Natural History in the German capital. The 150-million-year-old dinosaur skeleton — one of the tallest mounted dinosaur skeletons in the world — dominates the Berlin museum's central atrium.
In the early 1900s, German paleontologists and their African helpers excavated it near Tendaguru Hill, a region famous for its fossils, in the Lindi region in present-day Tanzania. The skeleton has thrilled school classes and visitors to Berlin since it was first displayed in 1937, but few are aware of its history.
The dinosaur is also on the travel list of Tanzanian historian Philemon Mtoi, who believes the skeleton came to Berlin illegally. ""This animal is not originated from Germany. So I think it should be displayed in its country of origin,"" Mtoi said, adding that it was one of the very special animals in the world.
""It will attract a lot of people. A lot of people are coming to see the display of this animal in the Berlin museum. It does not benefit the country where it was taken first.""
Since his childhood, Mtoi has heard discussions in his home country about the possible repatriation of fossils and other natural and cultural artifacts that Germany collected. 
These are ""very important discussions,"" Mtoi told DW. Such discussions are an ""opportunity to have a dialog which will end up in a positive way,"" he said. ""But if people don't discuss, the environment will be very hostile for these two parties.""
Germany has recently been trying to tackle this aspect of its colonial legacy.
Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock traveled to Nigeria last December to return Benin Bronzes to Nigeria. Britain colonized Nigeria until its independence on October 1, 1960. The 21 artifacts had been looted by British soldiers from the Kingdom of Benin, now in Nigeria, and were then sold to German museums. These are the first of 1,130 Benin Bronzes that Germany promised to return.
The German colonial government also ""stole the skeletons of thousands of the dead from cemeteries in order to measure and collect them,"" a government website admits.
Around 200 skulls will be returned to Tanzania, as well as more than 900 to Rwanda, which along with Burundi and small parts of northern Mozambique, made up German East Africa.
Historian Jürgen Zimmerer, a professor at the University of Hamburg, said he finds it interesting that after ""decades of colonial amnesia and the refusal to take colonialism, colonial violence, colonial crimes and injustice seriously,"" Germany has changed its heart.
""But Germany focuses on the area of museums and art, it returns objects,"" he said. ""What it wants to avoid is recognizing the structural, racist nature of colonialism as such, because that raises very fundamental questions about reparations, about apologies.""
German politician Sevim Dagdelen, a member of the opposition Left Party, also thinks Germany should be doing more to examine its legacy in East Africa between 1885 und 1918.
""Anyone who, like Chancellor Olaf Scholz, proposes a new start in relations with African states mustn't try to sit out the political and legal processing of colonial crimes,"" she said.
Dagdelen and several other Left Party members recently submitted a parliamentary question about the reappraisal of colonial crimes in present-day Tanzania.
The government's response to the parliamentary question is quite concrete when it comes to artifacts: ""With regard to the repatriation of human remains and the return of cultural property, there are offers of negotiations, and the German government is in favor of a dialogue with the Tanzanian government in this regard.""
One of Dagdelen's central questions, however, remains unanswered. She had asked whether German colonial troops' bloody suppression of the Maji Maji rebellion in southeastern Tanganyika could be described as genocide from today's perspective.
A precedent for this is Germany's official acknowledgment in 2021 that it committed genocide during its colonial occupation of Namibia when it massacred the Herero and Nama peoples in the early 1900s.
Between 1905 and 1907, the Germans quashed the Maji Maji uprising ""with extreme brutality, using scorched-earth tactics to starve localities into submission,"" according to the Oxford Research Encyclopedias.
It's thought that some 200,000 to 300,000 died from causes including battlefield deaths, livestock and food confiscation, and subsequent disease and malnutrition.
Some scholars have found strong evidence to support a claim of genocide in Germany's conduct in Tanzania.
While the German government admitted in its parliamentary answer to being aware of the nature of the Maji Maji crackdown, it dodged the question of genocide. Instead, it said it faces up to its ""moral and political responsibility"" and referred to ""trustful discussions"" with the Tanzanian government.
For Sevim Dagdelen, however, exploring whether a genocide took place is part of a constructive and goal-oriented dialogue. She also wants the government to learn from its mistakes in dealing with Namibia.
While both Germany and Namibia have made a joint declaration about the Herero and Nama genocide, the Namibian government is yet to ratify it. That's because the descendants of the genocide victims want direct reparations, rather than the €1.1 billion ($1.2 billion) promised to the Namibian government.
""From the beginning, the German government, in close coordination with the government of Tanzania, should also genuinely take into account the descendants of the victims or the communities particularly affected by the genocide and seek dialogue,"" Dagdelen said.
Historian Jürgen Zimmerer believes the German government is avoiding the issue because it is worried about setting a precedent.
""People are afraid of precedents when they officially acknowledge colonial violence in connection with reparations or apologies,"" he told DW, noting that there are demands for reparations from World War II. So the outcomes of ongoing debates on recognizing colonial injustice are being watched very closely.
""The German government thought it could sweep Namibia under the rug, [but] it can't do that,"" he said. ""And now, it wants to avoid a repeat of Namibia at all costs, in that it won't admit anything that in any way has similarities with Namibia — with the genocide back then — or could be construed in that way.""
The Left Party's parliamentary question also raises the reparations issue. The German government's answer: There has, so far, been no official demand from the Tanzanian government.
Tanzanian historian Mtoi, however, said he considers it inappropriate to wait for such demands to be made. Instead, Germany should make a clear signal of reconciliation, he said, because if Berlin hesitates now, it will strain relations for years.
Mtoi proposes a joint commission incorporating historians and academics from the former colonial countries.
""Germany is one of the strongest nations in the world,"" he said, and many countries look to it as an example. ""It is not bad to say sorry. It does not show that you are weak. It shows that you are responsible for the humanities in the world.""

https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-cultural-heritage-sites-damaged-after-dam-burst/a-65904943,CULTURE,Ukraine: Cultural heritage sites damaged after dam burst 14.06.2023,"Tens of thousands of people are directly affected by the floods following the breach of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine. Leaking oil threatens to cause serious damage to nature and animals as well. And, once again, cultural heritage sites and with them Ukraine's history are also at risk from the destruction, which many observers describe as a war crime.
Churches, monuments and museums are submerged all over the Kherson region. Archaeological sites dating back to the Scythians — a nomadic people who lived in the region in the 8th century BC — and a Greek settlement from around 400 BC have been damaged or irretrievably destroyed.
""The damage affects culturally and historically significant properties from different centuries,"" Kilian Heck, an art historian at the University of Greifswald, told DW. ""In terms of archaeological sites, Ukraine is one of the first places of discovery in the world."" The affected region in southern Ukraine had also become the center of Cossack culture in the 16th century and was also symbolically significant for the country's independence.
The extent of the damage is not yet clear, and information is scarce. Large parts of the flooded region are occupied by Russian troops, the Dnipro river marks the front line between Russian and Ukrainian soldiers.

According to official Ukrainian information, a museum honoring writer and humorist Ostap Vyshnya, which was not restored until 2020, and the Kherson Art Museum, named after painter Oleksii Shovkunenko, remain flooded as well.
In the flooded town of Oleshky, the former residence of folk artist Polina Rayko had been damaged by the water as well. The artist had begun painting only at the age of 69. She painted frescoes on the walls of her house and the building is one of Ukraine's official cultural heritage sites.
 
""The situation is unprecedented,"" says Kilian Heck, who helped initiate the Ukraine Art Aid Center after the Russian invasion last year. The network of art historians and museum experts organizes aid shipments with packaging materials, generators or dehumidification equipment to protect works of art in Ukraine from the consequences of the war.
A certain routine was established during the war. Kilian Heck explains: ""We rehearsed routines like: pack the works up, put them in the basement or evacuate them.""
The flood, on the other hand, is a completely new challenge: ""There are hardly any means of responding appropriately in terms of conservation. It's a new form destruction of cultural assets.""
In frequent Zoom meetings, German art historians exchange information with colleagues from Ukraine. Colleagues from the flooded areas had recently reported corpses floating in the water, which had been washed out of the cemeteries by the masses of water. Animal carcasses floating in the water, as well as contamination, also raised concerns about epidemics.
""The most important thing right now is to provide water filters,"" says Kilian Heck.

The dam and hydroelectric plant near Kachowka were destroyed on June 6, with Ukraine and Russia blaming each other. Ukrainian authorities have called on the International Criminal Court in The Hague to investigate the destruction of the dam. The reservoir stored about 18 billion cubic meters of water. Authorities in the Kherson region reported that 600 square kilometers of land had been flooded — about the size of Chicago.

The pass can be spent on a variety of cultural activities of their choice, including museum visits, films, theater and concerts. But will they choose pop music or opera?
Holders can also spend the money on physical objects like records and books, and even on musical instruments — although the money must be spent ""locally,"" excluding non-German streaming and subscription services.
The funding, which has cost the German government €100 million, will initially apply to around 750,000 people. Anyone who turns 18 in 2023 and is a registered resident of Germany is eligible for the program.
With the initiative, which will be launched on June 14, the federal government aims to encourage young people to experience culture locally: ""We want to open the way to culture,"" Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and Media Claudia Roth said. The ""KulturPass"" is also intended to support the cultural sector, which continues to suffer the effects of the pandemic.
When she announced the move last November, Roth described the voucher as the ""equivalent of a birthday present"" for those who will turn 18 in 2023.
""The 'Kulturpass' is a great opportunity for 18-year-olds to make the most of the rich and diverse cultural life in our country,"" Roth told the German news agency dpa, adding that it was important to offer this to ""the 18-year-olds of today and thus to win them over in the longer term.""
Berlin is one of the few cities in the world that has a total of three opera houses! Thankfully, there's no phantom — or else he'd be rather busy. The reason for this unique situation is that for decades, Berlin, like the whole of Germany, was divided between East and West. Today, you can hear performances at the Berlin State Opera, the Deutsche Oper or Komische Oper.










When the plans were first announced, some critics feared the money could profit internet giants, until it became clear that large online retailers such as Amazon, streaming services such as Netflix or music platforms like Spotify, would be excluded from the ""KulturPass.""
Cultural providers need to register to be part of the scheme. More than 700 cultural events and organizations have joined the initiative so far. The eligible institutions and businesses that are not yet part of the program have been urged to sign up.
The German scheme follows an example set by several other European countries.
In 2016, Italy launched the ""18app,"" which offered €500 to 18-year-olds for cultural activities, which was seen by many as a success. But since her election in 2022, right-wing populist Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has threatened to scrap the app. She has announced new schemes based on ""merit"" and family income, but the popularity of the ""18app"" scheme has made it difficult to get rid of — and any change has now been postponed until 2024. 
France launched a program in which €300 was handed out to 18-year-olds in 2021. It allowed French youth to spend the voucher on activities as well as French streaming platforms, musical instruments and books. But much to the frustration of many champions of French classical arts and culture, according to The New York Times, 75% of the purchases in 2021 were of books, of which two-thirds were the Japanese comic form manga.
Spain, launching their own €400-scheme in 2022, attempted to find a compromise by placing a cap on how much could be spent on each type of service. For example, only €100 can be spent on physical objects and only €200 on live event tickets. 
German officials say they have been directly inspired by other European schemes, though they shied away from putting a Spain-like cap on the scheme. Some commentators have said that Germany's €200 will not go very far compared to other European countries, while others welcome any opportunity for youth the engage with the cultural scene.

The children were traveling with their mother from the Amazonian village of Araracuara to the town of San Jose del Guaviare when the plane went down.
The Cessna single-engine propeller plane was carrying three adults and the four children when the pilot declared an emergency due to engine failure. None of the adults survived.
After wandering alone for more than a month, the Huitoto Indigenous children — ages 13, nine, five, and one — were rescued and airlifted out of the Amazon on Friday, and were recovering two days later in a military hospital in the capital Bogota.
The siblings are expected to remain for at least two weeks in a hospital receiving treatment after their rescue, but some are already speaking and wanting to do more more than lie in bed, relatives said. 
When rescuers reached the kids, the first words they uttered were ""I'm hungry"" and ""my mom is dead,"" members of the rescue group said in a televised interview Sunday.
Members of the group, themselves members of the Indigenous population, recounted the first moments after meeting the children.
""The eldest daughter, Lesly, with the little one in her arms, ran towards me. Lesly said: 'I'm hungry,'"" said Nicolas Ordonez Gomes, one of the search and rescue crew. ""One of the two boys was lying down. He got up and said to me: 'My mom is dead.'""
Henry Guerrero, an Indigenous man who was part of the search group, told reporters that the children were found with two small bags containing some clothes, a towel, a flashlight, two cellphones, a music box and a soda bottle. He said they used the bottle to collect water in the jungle.

Manuel Miller Ranoque, the father of the children, speaking to the press on Sunday outside the hospital, said that his wife had been severely injured in the crash, but that she did not die until four days later, with her children beside her.
""The one thing that (13-year-old Lesly) has cleared up for me is that, in fact, her mother was alive for four days,"" Ranoque told reporters. Magdalena Mucutuy, the children's mother, was an Indigenous leader herself.
""Before she died, their mom told them something like, 'You guys get out of here. You guys are going to see the kind of man your dad is, and he's going to show you the same kind of great love that I have shown you,'"" Ranoque said.
Authorities and family members have said the siblings ate cassava flour and seeds. Their familiarity with some of the rainforest's fruits were also key to staying alive.
They ate seeds, fruits, roots and plants that they identified as edible from their upbringing in the Amazon region, Luis Acosta of the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia said.
""The survival of the children is a sign of the knowledge and relationship with the natural environment that is taught starting in the mother's womb,"" he added.


Army chief Helder Giraldo said rescuers had covered over 2,600 kilometers in total to locate the children. ""Something that seemed impossible was achieved,"" Giraldo said on Twitter. In addition to jaguars, snakes and other predators, the area is also home to armed drug smuggling groups.
""It was a successful amalgam of indigenous knowledge and military art,"" General Pedro Sanchez, who led the search operations, said.  In this mission ""failing or giving up was not an option,"" Sanchez said. His men, the most highly trained in the Colombian army, had accomplished ""the impossible,"" he added.
According to Sanchez, the children were found 5 kilometers away from the crash site in a small forest clearing. He said rescue teams had passed within 20 to 50 meters of where the children were found on a couple of occasions but had missed them.
Two weeks after the crash, on May 16, a search team found the plane in a thick patch of the rainforest and recovered the bodies of the three adults on board, but the small children were nowhere to be found.
Soldiers on helicopters dropped boxes of food into the jungle, hoping that it would help sustain the children.
Planes flying over the area fired flares to help search crews on the ground at night, and rescuers used speakers that blasted a message recorded by the siblings' grandmother telling them to stay in one place. The Colombian government, which is trying to end internal conflicts in the country, has praised the joint work of the military and Indigenous communities to find the children.

https://www.dw.com/en/bach-festival-2023-classical-music-goes-cosmic/a-65888840,MUSIC,Bach Festival 2023: Classical music goes cosmic 12.06.2023,"For 38-year-old composer Johann Sebastian Bach, his 1723 appointment as musical director (Thomaskantor) in the St. Thomas Church in Leipzig must have seemed like a huge step. What Bach could not know is that, three centuries later, his music would reach beyond Earth's atmosphere.
Almost exactly 300 years since he started working in the city, Leipzig is celebrating the composer with their annual Bach Festival. The 2023 festival opened with ""Earth Chaconne"" — a 15-minute film from the  astronauts of the International Space Station showing a spectacular view of the Earth, played along with the famous Chaconne from Bach's Partita for Violin No. 2 in D minor.
Bach worked in Leipzig for the last 27 years of his life. During this time, he composed works that remain some of the most influential and important of all time — including the Passions, the B minor Mass, the ""Art of the Fugue"" and also the great cantata cycles that are the focus of this year's Bach Festival, or Bachfest.
""This Bachfest is special because everything is under the banner of this anniversary,"" Michael Maul, director of the Bachfest Leipzig, told DW. ""'Bach for Future' is the motto we came up with because we wanted to show not only that we are looking to the future, but because we want to make it clear that the works Bach composed here in Leipzig back then, 300 years ago, are actually so strong that they are still 'for future' today.""
The ambitious composer astonished his contemporaries with his first cantata cycle. Over the course of a year, he transformed traditional musical forms many times over and creatively developed the genre of church cantata. And in this time he was extremely prolific: He composed a new work for performance every single Sunday.
""Bach is just number one,"" Dutch conductor and Bach expert Ton Koopman explained at the Bachfest's opening press conference. ""If there is such a thing in heaven as a regulars' table of the greatest composers of all time, at which Mozart, Wagner, Verdi and all the others also sit, the colleagues have certainly chosen Bach as 'chairman,'"" Koopman, himself a living Bach legend, added in a DW interview.
Alongside Philippe Herreweghe and other stars of the scene, Koopmann will present his favorite cantatas at the Bach Festival.
When asked about the relevance of the Bach for Future motto, festival director Michael Maul explained: ""Bach's music will be presented in new contexts. With outstanding debutants, fresh formats and many a surprising adaptation and reinterpretation of familiar works.""
A commitment to Bach's visions of the future was already made at the opening concert in St. Thomas Church. Bach's cantata ""Die Elenden sollen essen"" (""The Wretched Shall Eat""), with which choirmaster Bach introduced himself to the people of Leipzig on the first Sunday after Trinity Sunday in 1723, was performed here once more.
To complement it, a new work was commissioned for performance in the St. Thomas Church: In his cantata for soloists, choir, organ and orchestra, contemporary composer Jörg Widmann takes the baroque form of the cantata and gives it new spirit.
""Bach was extremely contemporary in his works and also radically topical,"" Widmann told DW. ""In his inaugural cantata, 'Die Elenden sollen essen,' he takes up one of the most topical themes of his time — grave poverty. And so I, too, have chosen a theme that cannot be bypassed today — war.""
Widmann begins with the famous 18th-century anti-war song, ""Es ist Krieg!"" (""It is war!"") by Matthias Claudius, and weaves an intense text-music work into the 20th century, with the powerful final words of the famous Hitler-opponent Dietrich Bonhoeffer, written shortly before the theologian's execution by the Nazis: ""This is the end — for me, the beginning of life.""
 For Widmann, this confidence is not a reason to do nothing, but quite the opposite.
""It may sound naïve, but I firmly believe that we can and must use music to help stop the disaster into which our world is sinking,"" Widmann explained. ""Bach saw it no differently in his time and would see it the same way today, I'm sure.""

The program features nearly five dozen concerts and other events over 11 festival days, June 8-18, at more than 20 venues across the city.
But if that is still not enough, Bach fans can also head to Leipzig's handsome marketplace. Under a bright summer sky, and with free admission, young and experienced Bach musicians from all over — from violin virtuoso Daniel Hope and star pianist Lang Lang to the heavy metal band ""Son of a Bach"" — will perform throughout the festival.
Lang Lang told the audience his appearance in Leipzig was a ""dream come true."" He said he had never felt so close to the greatest genius of music as here, in Leipzig.
Lang Lang enchanted the audience with fragments of the famous Goldberg Variations, played with a depth and intimacy that could hardly be surpassed.
Bach is a composer who speaks directly to the heart, from the past to the present — and the future.

https://www.dw.com/en/lee-miller-from-muse-to-war-photographer/a-65846772,CULTURE,Lee Miller: From muse to war photographer 11.06.2023,"Born in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1907, Elizabeth ""Lee"" Miller showed an early interest in the arts and Europe, moving to Paris at age 18 to study lighting, costume and design at a theater school. A year later, she moved to New York City, studying theater, drawing and painting.
Soon after, she became one of the most sought-after models in New York, purely by accident, when Conde Montrose Nast, the publisher of Vogue magazine, saved her from getting run over by a car. But Miller quickly tired of modeling, and was far more interested in taking photographs herself.
In 1929, Miller returned to Paris, where she became the student, muse, lover and collaborator of the artist and photographer Man Ray. Together, they made the technique of solarization — used here in this portrait of Miller made by Ray — one of their aesthetic trademarks. Miller set up her own photographic studio and established herself as an artist.
After leaving Man Ray, Miller married her first husband, Egyptian businessman Aziz Eloui Bey, in 1934 and moved with him to Cairo. There, she applied her surrealism-trained eye to photographing the natural landscape of Egypt, resulting in some of her best-known artworks like this photo, ""Portrait of Space.""
In 1937, Miller returned to Paris, where she met her second husband, the British surrealist painter Roland Penrose, with whom she later had a son. The couple settled in London, and with the outbreak of the Second World War, Miller decided to put her photographic skills to use as a war correspondent for Vogue magazine.
She traveled through England and Europe and was at the frontlines, the only woman photographer granted permission to travel independently in the war zones. The photos she took during this period merged photojournalism with art, as her surrealist sensibilities informed the framing of her shots.
 
Miller was also praised for picking out small moments that a man might have missed. One of her most famous photos shows her bathing in Hitler's bathtub in Munich on the same day the Nazi dictator committed suicide in Berlin. She was billeted in Hitler's Munich apartment after documenting the liberated Dachau concentration camp.
Miller was motivated by empathy more than a desire to aestheticize, and her photos of the death and destruction und human suffering she witnessed retain their shocking power more than seven decades later. 
Lee Miller shared close friendships with several of her fellow artists, including Pablo Picasso. She took nearly 1,000 photos of him during the four decades they knew each other, and he painted her six times. Miller’s son, Antony Penrose, has written a children’s book about his childhood experiences with the artist, titled ""The Boy Who Bit Picasso."" This photograph by Miller of the two was taken at Picasso’s studio in Paris shortly after the liberation of the city by Allied forces.

Miller remained deeply affected by what she saw and documented during the war, and suffered from depression and alcoholism after returning to England. She eventually gave up photography, turning her creativity to cooking gourmet meals for her friends and family.
Lee Miller died of cancer at the age of 70 in 1977. Her trailblazing influence and legacy, both as an artist and a war reporter, have earned her an important place in the history of 20th-century photography. The Bucerius Kunst Forum in Hamburg is now dedicating a retrospective to this remarkable photographer.

https://www.dw.com/en/rammstein-tour-goes-on-despite-accusations-against-lindemann/a-65849755,MUSIC,Rammstein tour goes on despite accusations against Lindemann 07.06.2023,"Despite the accusations of sexual misconduct against singer Till Lindemann, Rammstein's European tour continues.
On Wednesday, Rammstein is set to perform the first of four concerts in Munich, while the allegations continue to swirl over the band's lead singer.
The public prosecutor's office has yet to officially investigate the band and its frontman.

According to numerous statements reported in German media by those affected, Lindemann is said to have ""ordered"" young women from the audience to come backstage to have sex with him.
Some of the women say they were drugged. The selection of the young women was carried out by the self-proclaimed ""casting director"" Alena Makeeva, who ""invited"" the girls to the alleged pre- or after-show party, and who has since parted company with the band, Die Welt reported this week.
In addition, the band's management has hired a law firm to investigate the allegations. And it has announced an awareness concept for the four Munich concerts, a spokesman for Olympiapark München GmbH said.
Accordingly, six employees are to be on the lookout for unusual situations in the stadium in conjunction with security. In addition, there is to be a safe-space area where those affected can withdraw.
There are already consequences for the upcoming concerts. The so-called ""Row Zero,"" the security area directly in front of the stage, has been abandoned. For the past four years, small groups of mostly very young, often conspicuously dressed women, have been seen there on the right and left edges of the stage.
After-show parties have also been dispensed with and no selfies with Lindemann will be taking place.
Johnny Depp is set to be honored for his life's work at the San Sebastian International film Festival, despite allegations of domestic violence. A court has been dealing with allegations made by his ex-wife, Amber Heard, since July 2020. Critics argue Depp should not be honored for his career as long as the case is ongoing.










Politicians have also voiced their thoughts on the recent developments and are calling for an increased security concept for such events.
""Patriarchal behavior and sexual assaults have no place in the music industry, as in art and culture in general and everywhere else,"" German Minister of Culture Claudia Roth (from the Green Party) told the German news agency DPA, while applauding the courage of many young women who have spoken openly about their traumatic experiences.
Lisa Paus, German Federal Minister for Family Affairs, has demanded concrete changes from the music industry.
""Sexual assaults occur in all walks of life,"" Paus said. ""At festivals or concerts, a great many people come together in one place; plus; there is often alcohol and drugs involved, which lowers the inhibition threshold for perpetrators and can leave victims disoriented.""
This is not new, she said, but there needs to be talk about how to better protect young people in particular.
She invited the music industry to join the ""Together against Sexism"" alliance, a broad coalition of politics, business, administration, media, culture and civil society.

The Federal Association of the Concert and Event Industry (BDKV) expressed its openness to change. The association is in talks with the ministry ""to jointly advance this important process,"" a spokesperson said.
Till Lindemann himself remains silent and has deleted his Instagram profile.
The band Rammstein did release a collective statement on social media this week, asking not to be judged.

""This journey has been marked by sweat and tears, but also by many moments of happiness and communion — this success is the success of us all,"" Marthe Wandou, from Cameroon's Far North region, told DW.
Wandou is one of the three prizewinners representing the 1st National Women's Convention for Peace in Cameroon's 80 member organizations. The German Africa Foundation organizes the annual award.
The foundation has been committed to strengthening relations between Germany and Africa for 45 years. Since 1993, the foundation has awarded the German Africa Prize to outstanding personalities from the continent who have made exceptional contributions to democracy, peace, human rights, arts and culture, economic development, science and society.
The 1st National Women's Convention for Peace is the largest and most far-reaching network of women's organizations focusing on peace in Cameroon.
It was established in January 2021 and consists of 80 groups that represent the 10 regions of Cameroon, as well as up to 25 distinct social categories of women.
""This is a great recognition for the work of women peace builders,"" said Esther Omam, from Cameroon's Southwest region.
""The members of the platform are happy to accept this act of recognition on behalf of all the women of Cameroon, ""those living in conflict zones and those committed to building peace at all levels and in all senses,"" she said.
Women have been significantly affected by the security crises in four of Cameroon's 10 regions. 
The largest gathering of its kind in Cameroon's history, it brought together more than 1,800 women from all 10 regions and 58 departments: young girls, older women, academics, athletes, soldiers, artists and scientists.
The women called for an immediate cease-fire, a resumption of dialogue between the government and separatists in the English-speaking regions of Cameroon, a place for women at the negotiating table, the strengthening of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration centers and the creation of psychosocial support centers for war victims in conflict regions.
""Together, we have built an alliance that is stronger, louder and more numerous than those who profit from war,"" Sally Mboumien, a prizewinner from the North-West region, told DW.
""We are ready to dialogue, ready to mediate, ready to support initiatives,"" Mboumien said, ""and to contribute our efforts to end these crises.""
The women have been rewarded for their tireless work advocating peace.
""The jury has decided to award this year's German Africa Prize to the 1st National Women's Convention for Peace for its significant contribution to conflict resolution in four different regions of the country,"" said Sabine Odhiambo, secretary-general of the German Africa Foundation.

Odhiambo said the organization was awarded for its pioneering work in facilitating dialogue for peace and reconciliation and for increasing women's participation in conflict resolution in Cameroon. 
""The work and courage demonstrated by the convention, despite the personal dangers it faced, are a true source of inspiration, not only for women in conflict situations in Cameroon, but throughout Africa and the world,"" she said.
Last year, the German Africa Prize was won by Sikhulile Moyo and Tulio de Oliveira, two scientists in South Africa who discovered the COVID-19 omicron variant.

https://www.dw.com/en/picassos-buste-de-femme-fetches-34-million-in-germany/a-65824444,ARTS,Picasso's 'Buste de Femme' fetches €3.4 million in Germany 05.06.2023,"In 1971, two years before his death, Pablo Picasso created the painting ""Buste de Femme."" Art historians identified the woman in the painting as Picasso's second wife, Jacqueline Roque.
Now, that painting has garnered €3.4 million ($3.65 million): on Monday, it was sold at the the Cologne auction house Van Ham in Cologne.
The work was originally expected to fetch between €1.5 to 2.4 million ($1.6 to 2.6 million). But even at €3.4 million, it was still a bargain compared to the record-breaking $179.4 million dollars (some €160 million euros) paid for Picasso's ""The Women of Algiers"" in 2015. 
The auction house launched a PR campaign to try to drive up the price of ""Buste de Femme,"" displaying the work in Berlin, Munich and Hamburg before the auction. According to Van Ham, it was the first time in nearly 25 years that a major work by Picasso went up for auction in Germany. 
The painting of Roque was originally from her estate, but was auctioned on behalf of a German private collector.
Picasso and Roque met in 1953, and Roque, who was born in France in 1927, was more than 40 years younger than the Spanish-born artist. They married following the death of the painter's first wife, Olga Khokhlova.

Picasso depicted Roque, with her thick dark hair and classically Mediterranean facial features, more often any of his numerous mistresses or his other wife.
None of her predecessors devoted their lives as fully to Picasso as Roque did. She moved back to France in 1954 and was at his side almost constantly until his death on April 8, 1973, which left her utterly bereft.
Emaciated and severely depressed, she took her own life 13 years later. Roque had worshipped Picasso and called him her ""sun."" At the time of her suicide, Roque was 59 years old.
 







2023 marks the 50th anniversary of Pablo Picasso's death, and museums around the world are paying tribute with exhibitions. But the celebrations have also increasingly focused on the Spanish-born artist's relationships with his wives and mistresses.
Only now — in the wake of the #MeToo movement and a new wave of self-assertion among women — is new focus being paid to the ways in which Picasso exploited his power and influence with women. 
The artist himself made no secret of that: he once said he divided women into goddesses and doormats, and almost all of the women in his life underwent this shift at some point. But now, on the occasion of the landmark year, new books and exhibitions are drawing attention to it as well. As a result, some art connoisseurs viewing Picasso differently. 
This article was originally written in German and published on June 5, 2023. It was updated on June 6, 2023 to reflect the auction price.

https://www.dw.com/en/why-the-laugh-of-the-medusa-remains-influential-today/a-65785050,LITERATURE,Why 'The Laugh of the Medusa' remains influential today 05.06.2023,"Helene Cixous' call is clear: ""Woman must write her self.""
Even if some of the post-structuralist and theoretical references in ""The Laugh of the Medusa"" can feel challenging for unversed readers, the essay by the French feminist author is filled with striking, empowering quotes.
It remains essential reading, especially for any young woman hoping to become an author: ""Write, let no one hold you back, let nothing stop you: not man; not the imbecilic capitalist machinery, in which publishing houses are the crafty, obsequious relayers of imperatives handed down by an economy that works against us and off our backs; and not yourself.""
Born on June 5, 1937, in French Algeria to Jewish parents, Cixous became known for her experimental writing style, covering many genres: theater, literary and feminist theory, art criticism, autobiography and poetic fiction.
In 1974, Cixous established Europe's first center for women's studies at the University of Paris VIII, a public and experimental university which she also co-founded as a direct response to the French student riots of May 1968.
The essayist, novelist and playwright has published over 70 works and is seen as a strong contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature. 
Her most influential article remains ""The Laugh of the Medusa,"" which was originally published in French under the title ""Le Rire de la Meduse"" in 1975, and was translated into English by Paula Cohen and Keith Cohen in 1976.
Even though the literary landscape has considerably evolved since the 1970s, with more women authors being published and gaining recognition in recent years, ""The Laugh of the Medusa"" is an important reminder that over millennia, our Western cultural heritage has been defined through the male perspective.
Cixous argues that woman's abasement has been defined by how we have been ""colonized"" by ""phallogocentric"" thinking. The author builds on ideas developed by fellow Algerian-born French philosopher Jacques Derrida (1930-2004). He was the one who coined the term ""phallogocentrism,"" which refers to the focus given to the masculine point of view through language.
While she rejects our culture's imposed patriarchal narratives, Cixous' essay is equally filled with juicy phallic references, such as: ""The act of writing is equivalent to masculine masturbation (and so the woman who writes cuts herself out a paper penis).""
For the feminist author, there is a direct connection between freeing woman's writing and the liberation of their personal sexuality, as both woman's writing and masturbation were too long associated with shame; they could only be done in secret, and accompanied by a feeling of guilt.
The essay refers to the Greek myth of Medusa, a monster with venomous snakes for hair, whose gaze turned men to stone.
For Cixous, men's narrative portrayals of Medusa — a symbol of seduction and power — turned her into a symbol of the threat of castration. Medusa represented their fear of female desire.
""My text was an update of Greek mythology. There is no better example to describe the position of women and the murderous battle men take up against women. Medusa was one of three Gorgons [powerful, winged daemons], the daughters of Phorkys and Keto. She was the only mortal among them. Men were afraid of her. When they looked at her, they turned to stone,"" Cixous told DW in December 2022, referring to her famous essay.
""But why did she have such great power over men? Because she saw the men. The latter did not have the time to see her,"" she added.
""Men do not want to see women and they put veils over them so that they become invisible, like phantoms. It is terrible to what extent women have been veiled, even in daily life,"" Cixous said in the DW interview focusing on women's protests in Iran. ""Yet women are not objects, not veiled dolls. They are radiant. They are beautiful. My Medusa has traveled around the world. Right now she is obviously in Iran.""

The feminist author was initially hesitant to speak on behalf of women fighting for their rights in Iran:
""Of course, I ask myself whether I can legitimately comment on this. After all, I'm not in Iran and I'm not risking my life like the people there. But she was encouraged to do so by fellow feminists: ""My Iranian friends told me, why don't you do something? Speak! If you speak, the local people will hear. It is important for me to say, I heard you.""
Meanwhile, Medusa has been widely adopted by feminists and the #MeToo movement as a symbol of rage and the protector of women's secrets.
Cixous has also revisited her own text in a 2010 republication of the French original with a new foreword, exploring the idea of Medusa as a queer body, which is another reason why the essay remains widely quoted to this day.
""You only have to look at the Medusa straight on to see her,"" writes Cixous. ""And she's not deadly. She's beautiful and she's laughing.""

https://www.dw.com/en/india-train-crash-is-enough-being-done-to-make-travel-safe/a-65819612,POLITICS,India train crash: Is enough being done to make travel safe? 04.06.2023,"With the death toll now at 300 and over 1,000 injured, the tragic accident in Balasore, eastern Odisha has once again focused attention on the issue of railway safety in India.
The crash was one of the country's deadliest train accidents in decades, and occurred at a time when the government has been trying to make rail travel a pleasurable, and, more importantly, safe experience.
Such crashes are far from unprecedented in India. In 1999, a collision between two trains in West Bengal killed 285 people, and in 2010, 145 died in the same state when a passenger train derailed and was hit by a cargo train. More recently, in 2016, 160 people died when a passenger train traveling between the cities of Indore and Patna slipped off its tracks.
For the last few years, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been trying to stimulate its rail modernization push by introducing high-speed, automated trains in one of the largest and busiest rail networks in the world. This includes a plan to have 100% electrification of the railways by 2024 and make the network carbon-neutral by 2030.
Earlier this year, German engineering giant Siemens received a huge order to manufacture 1,200 electric trains, while Japanese expertise has been commissioned to provide technology and finance to assist in the construction of the first bullet train, a 508-kilometer (316-mile) link between Mumbai and Ahmedabad.
But experts have blamed crumbling infrastructure for causing numerous train accidents, raising questions about the money spent on train maintenance and track renewal.
Indian Railways, considered to be the lifeline of the nation with between 1.3 to 1.4 million employees, and carries around 23 million passengers and 3 million tons of freight every day. Over 21,000 trains work on a broad-gauge network of some 68,000 kilometers (42,000 miles).
However, according to an assessment by the government's comptroller and auditor general, 163 of the 217 ""consequential train accidents"" from 2017 to 2018 and 2020 to 2021 were caused by derailments, accounting for around 75% of accidents.
The report, submitted to parliament last December, said a major factor in these accidents was the lack of maintenance on railway tracks. Funds for track renewal had declined, the report said, and, in many cases, were not being fully utilized.
Fires, accidents at unmanned level crossings and collisions were the other causes of accidents cited by the report. What is more, concerns have been flagged on the acute shortage of manpower, especially in track safety, with many posts lying vacant in departments across the network.
Though the cause of the Odisha accident is still being investigated, officials have hinted that the likely reason was a signaling error that led the Chennai-bound Coromandel Express to fatally change tracks, causing it to ram into a stationary freight train.

""From the nature of the accident, it was caused by an error in the electronic signaling system that led a train to wrongly change tracks,"" a senior railway official, requesting anonymity, told DW. ""The passenger train entered another loop line and crashed into a goods train.""
""There was no anti-collision device on the train, as far as I know,"" Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal chief minister and a former railway minister, told the Indian media. ""Had the device been on the train, this would not have happened.""
The new anti-train collision system, named Kavach, causes trains to brake automatically, but it has only been operational on 2% of the vast rail network.
The Kavach system is designed to help train operators avoid signal passing and overspeeding while also providing support for train operations during adverse weather conditions such as dense fog. By automatically applying brakes when necessary, the system ensures better control over train speed.
""If the Modi government has effected a quantum increase in modernization and expansion of the rail network, with an unprecedented increase in capital expenditure, has investment in safety increased proportionately?"" said M K Venu, an economic analyst, speaking with DW.
The initial development of Kavach began in 2012 and was completed last year. But less than 5 billion Indian rupees (€56.5 million/$605 million) was allocated to install the system last year, when estimates suggested that a trillion rupees would have been necessary to cover the entire railway network. This year's budget has brought a windfall for railways, with $29 billion allocated for railway development, the highest ever.
Apparently realizing that the railways have a huge multiplier effect on the economy, the government is now planning to double lines more quickly, convert nearly the entire network to broad-gauge, introduce high-powered locomotives and complete electrification projects. All of these measures are expected to increase Indian Railways' line capacity.
India has also rolled out the high-speed, automated Vande Bharat trains, equipped with state-of-the-art passenger amenities that provide a faster and more convenient travel experience.
The government intends to introduce nearly 400 Vande Bharat trains during the next five years and manufacture hydrogen-powered, eco-friendly Vande Metro trains to replace old trains designed in the 1950s and '60s.
A lot more still needs to be done to upgrade the 65,000 kilometers (more than 40,300 miles) of tracks and install modern signaling equipment on the network. For now, the train accident in eastern Odisha is a stark reminder of the obstacles facing the government in delivering on its promise to make the railways more efficient, and safer.

This year's Biennale, at which architects from all over the world will congregate, presents 63 national pavilions in the old brick halls of the Arsenale, the former shipyard and naval base of the former Republic of Venice. 
This year's installment is dominated by climate change issues and a reappraisal of the colonial era. It's about questions of production, resources and representation, said chief curator Lesley Naa Norle Lokko at a press conference ahead of the event: ""It's about change.""
And change is much needed. According to UN predictions, the world's population will grow from its current 8 billion to 10 billion by 2050. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, the population could double. That's incredible, said Peter Cachola Schmal, architecture expert and director of the German Architecture Museum in Frankfurt. The fact is that these people will need — and want — a roof over their heads.
For this reason, Lokko has deliberately focused on the African continent. The Ghanaian-Scottish architect, university lecturer and bestselling novelist curated the show's central exhibition — and invited 55 offices from around the world, with many from Africa or having African roots.
The consequences of global warming, resource consumption and migration are especially visible on the continent, and it's where Lokko sees the greatest challenges for architecture. Africa is the continent with the world's youngest population and the fastest urbanization — with 4% annual growth that often happens at the expense of local ecosystems. All of this puts Africa at the forefront of climate change, said Lokko.
There is no doubt that Africa has a huge need for construction. The question is how to build in times of climate change: the construction and operation of buildings accounts for about 40% of climate-damaging emissions, according to the WWF. Cement production alone accounts for about 8% of greenhouse gases worldwide.
That poses a dilemma. ""What does it mean for the world's CO2 management if unimaginable quantities of cement are produced in Africa all at once?"" asked architecture expert Schmal in a DW interview. ""The future contradicts all our goals of saving the world from climate collapse."" 
There is also the very practical question: Who is going to build the 1 billion housing units needed to accommodate all the people flocking to the growing megacities? Who, if not China?
For years, China's strategy has been to build African infrastructure, said Schmal, adding that the ""Chinese can do it."" In China, they have shown they can produce infrastructure — housing, construction, transportation — for tens of millions of people within a few years, he said. ""They have the experience that we don't have,"" he argued. ""The West slept through that.""
Whether the Venice Architecture Biennale is a wake-up call remains to be seen. The show certainly presents as a showcase of ideas, curated for the first time by a woman who grew up in Africa and who likely has different perspective on global architecture.
Lokko, born in 1964, is widely traveled. She grew up in Accra, the capital of  Ghana, and moved to the United Kingdom to study Hebrew and Arabic at Oxford University. She then studied architecture in London, where she earned her doctorate. Over her decadeslong career, she has taught on four continents.
Lokko is also a bestselling author, having published novels over the past 20 years that set a political and moral bar for contemporary events, from ""Sundowners"" in 2003 to ""Soul Sisters"" in 2021. Many of her books explore the lives of Black women in all corners of the world.
The architect has two buzzwords for her colleagues concerning the debate about the future — decarbonization and decolonization, lowering CO2 emissions and overcoming the legacy of colonization respectively. Both are likely to be discussed at the Venice architecture show. As was the case at last year's documenta 15, the world's largest art exhibition based in the German city of Kassel, the voice of the Global South will also be heard loud and clear in Venice.
The future of the planet will be decided in Africa, said Peter Cachola Schmal. Living conditions for people in sub-Saharan Africa must be ""adequate,"" he warned, adding it would be wise to help support the effort. Otherwise, more refugees could be headed to Europe. ""The West must prepare,"" he said.
Sustainability is the focus of the German pavilion at the Biennale, under the motto ""Open for Maintenance — Open due to Reconstruction,"" jointly curated by Summacumfemmer, ARCH+ and Büro Juliane Greb. They took over the pavilion as designed by Berlin-based artist, Maria Eichhorn, for last year's International Art Exhibition. It exposes the basic structures of a building converted by the Nazis.
The winner of the architecture show's Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement was announced earlier this year: The prize goes to the Nigerian artist, designer and architect Demas Nwoko.

Philippe Pozzo di Borgo, the scion of an aristocratic Corsican family, was badly injured in a paragliding accident in 1993 and lost the use of all four limbs.
In his book, ""Le Second Souffle"" (""A Second Wind"") which was the basis for the film ""The Intouchables,"" he described how his friendship with his young Algerian carer, Abdel Yasmin Sellou, rescued him from a deep depression following the accident.
Before the accident, Pozzo di Borgo was the managing director of the champagne producer Pommery.
Eric Toledano, who co-directed the 2011 film with Olivier Nakache, said Pozzo di Borgo's death was a ""shock"" and a reason for ""great mourning.""
In a statement, the two directors said, ""By giving permission to have his story made into the film 'The Intouchables,' he changed our lives and the lives of many vulnerable and fragile people."" 
The actor who played the part of Sellou in the film and won a Cesar award for his performance, Omar Sy, wrote on Instagram that Pozzo di Borgo was  ""forever in our hearts.""
The film, in which Pozzo di Borgo was played by Francois Cluzet, is one of the most popular French films of all time and scored a marked success around the world, particularly in Germany, where it was screened under the title ""Ziemlich beste Freunde"" (""Pretty Much Best Friends"").
A US remake called ""The Upside"" was later released in 2017, starring Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart.

https://www.dw.com/en/you-cant-do-decolonization-without-healing/a-65790887,ARTS,'You can't do decolonization without healing' 02.06.2023,"Born in Cameroon in 1977, Bonaventure Soj Bejeng Ndikung has a post-doctorate in biophysics, but he never lost sight of his true passion: the arts.
He recently became the director of Berlin's Haus der Kulturen der Welt (House of the World's Cultures), a national exhibition center for international, multidisciplinary contemporary arts and a forum for social debates.
For Bonaventure Soj Bejeng Ndikung, art is ""the highest form of politics"" and, at the same time, a ""universal language understood by almost everyone.""
DW's Dirke Köpp interviewed the curator as the Haus der Kulturen der Welt reopens on June 2, after months of closure for maintenance work.
DW: You are the first African at the head of the Haus der Kulturen der Welt, a cultural institution of great renown. Do you think this is still worth mentioning or has Germany overcome the stereotypes that might have prevented such an appointment in the past?
The truth is that I am the only African who is the director of such an institution in Germany. That means it's not completely normal yet. Things can still be improved. We have to keep working on that and in a few years, I hope it won't be a rarity anymore.
Do you think that as an African, as a Cameroonian, your programming you have planned for the Haus der Kulturen der Welt is different from that which would be planned by a German director?
Of course. Because knowledge is embodied.
As a Cameroonian, as someone who grew up in Bamenda, as an African, I carry with me different knowledge, different philosophies, I speak different languages.
I think that the program we are going to propose will indeed be different.
And above all, it's not just about me, because I managed to form a team of almost 15 exhibition curators who come from different parts of the world, who will also bring different knowledge. They come from Asia, South America, Africa, the United States and Europe. And that, of course, will influence our program.
You are a specialist in biotechnology by training, but you nevertheless began to take an interest in art and culture at an early age. Did you first avoid becoming an art historian for financial reasons?
I've had an interest in art since my childhood. But when I came to Germany, it was clear that I couldn't study art history — because in my context, in Cameroon, it's not something that gives you work afterwards.
So how did you get into the arts?
Already in Cameroon, I was very close to the artists. This means that I started my art studies when I was maybe 17 or 18, when I went to Yaoundé to study. But afterwards, in Berlin, after my studies, we had the opportunity to meet artists and it started like that.
My father was an anthropologist and therefore, when I was little, there were quite a few books by writers like Aimé Césaire, Walter Rodney or Jomo Kenyatta, as well as many other publications, and especially the works of Léopold Sédar Senghor. So I have learned the post-colonial critical discourse already from my childhood.
You are sometimes described as an intransigent militant against colonialism. Does this have to do with the fact that your father was an anthropologist?
I wouldn't call myself a militant for any cause — because I don't like the word ""militant."" I rather see myself as an advocate for the things that I find important in society.
What is your position regarding the return of looted works to Africa?
It is very clear that I would like to see the objects that were taken from Africans, Asians, Native Americans, or other parts of the world, returned to their original context. I would love to see a world where people are reunited with their sacred objects and their history.
What does this mean exactly?
It means that colonial history has really created destruction, all over the world. And that people have lost their history. ""Restitution"" means to return, but it also means to heal what has been destroyed. I think you can't do decolonization without healing, without restitution and without reparation and without rehabilitation. That's why I'm getting involved!
I repeat, I'm not a militant. But I'm passionate about it because we have to take our history into our own hands. To move forward in this world that is so destabilized, where there are a lot of imbalances, we have to restore harmony. And my project is a humanistic project to find harmony in the world.
Does the healing process also involve apologies?
Apologies are a starting point, but not the end.
When you give an apology, you look at the wounds you have made. It is an acknowledgment of what has been done. You can admit that you hurt people, that you recognize it and apologize. But that's not enough because the injury is still there.
What can we do to heal these wounds?
We need to engage in this process of healing, which really means restoring what has been destroyed. And in fact, restitution — I really want to emphasize this — is not only about returning works, but is also about the restitution of knowledge and the restitution of the dignity of human beings.
One of the greatest evils that has been inflicted in the context of colonization is the dehumanization of human beings. And we have to do exercises of re-humanization, of re-establishing this humanity that we have destroyed.
How can we restore this dignity in a very concrete way?
Very concretely, there are several paths that can be taken. We need to accept that there is no gradient between human beings, and that all human beings have the right to be what they want to be.

https://www.dw.com/en/how-supermodel-heidi-klum-built-a-multimillion-euro-empire/a-43901821,CULTURE,How supermodel Heidi Klum built a multimillion-euro empire 01.06.2023,"Working both in her native Germany and in the United States, Heidi Klum is one of the world's most successful celebrities. Her impressive career as a model has allowed her to venture into lucrative business and entertainment projects, and she shows no signs of slowing down as she turns 50 on Thursday.
""There aren't many world stars coming from Germany with that level of fame. It's Angela Merkel and Heidi,"" Thomas Hayo, a fashion photographer and one of Klum's judges on ""Germany's Next Topmodel"" (GNTM), told Forbes magazine.
Since 2006, millions of mainly young female viewers have been watching Klum host GNTM on the commercial broadcaster ProSieben. The reality TV show is based on the original ""America's Next Top Model,"" which her friend and fellow model Tyra Banks started in New York City in 2004. The German version of the show is currently the longest-airing ""Top Model"" adaptation.
As the central figure of the show, Klum makes it clear when she disapproves of a candidate's efforts, but will show her beaming, signature smile when a model performs well.
""I think most of the German people honor and admire Heidi's professionalism and huge success. They are proud of our only worldwide TV star,"" the fashion designer Michael Michalsky, who was on the judging panel of the show from 2016 to 2019, told DW in 2018.
""Heidi Klum has the image in Germany of the smart businesswoman. She's both self-confident and witty: the perfect host for 'Germany's Next Topmodel.' She represents success and discipline,"" said Franziska Frosch, deputy editor-in-chief of ELLE Germany. Klum embodies the stereotype of the self-made woman, Frosch said. ""If you believe Heidi Klum, it's not so much a gift from heaven that makes you attractive, but rather the result of hard work, self-control and personal evolution,"" Frosch added.
Klum's TV show is also widely criticized.
In a 2022 video, popular German YouTuber Rezo examined several cases of abuse, bullying, manipulation and misrepresentation on the show to back his claims that GNTM is ""toxic and harmful.""
Following the release of the video, Klum indirectly responded to it at the end of the 2022 finale: ""Unfortunately I will have to disappoint you, but we're going to continue exactly as before."" 
The 31-minute YouTube clip has been watched 4.2 million times. 
It's not just Klum's professional projects that the German media scrutinize. ""Despite all her perfection, her turbulent love life surely makes her entertaining and approachable. Again and again, her presence in the tabloids certainly generates sales,"" Frosch said.
To this day, Klum's love life is a theme of constant fascination. In 2018, she made public her relationship with Tokio Hotel guitarist Tom Kaulitz, who is now aged 33. They married at the beginning of 2019.
Before Kaulitz, Klum was dating Vito Schnabel, an art curator 13 years her junior. 
In the past, she was married to the singer Seal, with whom she shares three biological children; the musician also adopted Klum's first child.
Klum had her start in 1992 through a German modelling competition, landing on the covers of the international editions of fashion magazines. She caught the American public's eye when she appeared on the cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue in 1998, and became the first German model in the prestigious lineup of the Victoria's Secret Angels.
Klum leads a true trans-Atlantic life. When she isn't working on GNTM or on her fashion lines, she acts as a judge on  US TV shows.
From 2004 to 2017, she served on the panel of ""Project Runway,"" a cult hit reality TV series, where budding fashion designers compete against each other in a series of weekly challenges. She also has a producer credit on the show.
Klum was one of the original judges since the inception of the show, with ""Auf Wiedersehen"" serving as her famous catchphrase to bid farewell to the losing contestants. Similar to her GNTM persona, she is direct with her criticism and earnest, yet exudes warmth and encouragement.
Up until 2017, Harvey Weinstein was an executive producer for the show, and Klum opened up about how he lost that credit since the sexual harassment and assault accusations surfaced. ""I truly admire these brave women who are coming forward to share their stories because change cannot come unless there is a dialogue and people are held accountable,"" Klum told People magazine.
Klum has also regularly participated in determining the fate of contestants on various ""America's Got Talent"" shows. including ""America's Got Talent: All-Stars"" in 2023. As one of the judges on the panel, Klum's down-to-earth and girl-next-door personality comes through when delivering her feedback.
With her feet firmly planted on both sides of the Atlantic and jet-setting around the world, Klum remains a force in fashion and media, while also balancing motherhood with her busy life. For her birthday, the 50-year-old supermodel still flaunts her forever-young figure on the red carpets of the world.
As she once told Ellen Degeneres: ""I always think there are a lot of women my age, 50, 60, 70. What? Do we have an expiration date? Can we not also still feel sexy? I feel sexy.""
According to her legion of international fans, she definitely still is.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-left-wing-extremist-lina-e-found-guilty/a-65767893,POLITICS,German left-wing extremist Lina E. found guilty 31.05.2023,"A 28-year-old German student was found guilty of founding a criminal organization and committing six serious attacks on neo-Nazis, in an unusual case of violent left-wing extremism in Germany.
She was sentenced to five years and three months in prison but was later told she would only have to return to jail if she also loses an appeal. Her three male co-defendants were sentenced to around three years in prison each.
The defendants were greeted on Wednesday with a huge round of applause, many of them waving and smiling to friends and relatives in the courtroom in Dresden. When Lina E. herself was brought in, the applause was even louder and longer, with virtually the whole of the gallery, apart from the journalists, standing up.
As soon as the sentence was read, the gallery began chanting leftist messages of support. The judge called for quiet so he could read out his reasoning, saying: ""Anyone who is interested in hearing why the verdict was the way it was, can stay."" Someone immediately shouted: ""Because you're fascist friends!"" Others called out: ""F***ing class justice!""
The judge immediately called a 15-minute break, during which people who had shouted were to be removed by security.

There were loud groans of protest and tuts of disgust from the gallery throughout the reading of the court's reasoning. The judge said that, even if the political motivations of the defendants, such as fighting right-wing extremism, could be regarded as justified, that did not reduce the severity of their crimes. He also criticized the defense lawyers for describing the trial as ""political justice.""
The judge also took time to defend the German justice system, mentioning the number of convictions against violent far-right extremists that this court had itself handed down in the past few years. Again, this was greeted with scoffing and sarcastic laughter from the gallery.
However, late on Wednesday evening as the proceedings were drawing to a close, the judge gave the defendants' supporters in the courtroom a reason to cheer instead. 
After spending an exhausting day reading the court's entire reasoning (which took upwards of eight hours, including breaks), presiding judge Hans Schlüter-Staats did have one more surprise: By now audibly hoarse after recounting the details of the police investigation in painstaking detail, the judge declared in the evening that Lina E. would be freed until the conviction was upheld. 
Provided she gives up her passport and ID and reports to the police twice a week, Lina E. will be allowed to return home until any appeals are exhausted. If she does return to prison, she will have only around three years of her five-year sentence to serve, since she has been in custody since her arrest.
  
State prosecutors said Lina E.* and her three co-defendants — Lennart A., Philipp M., and Jannis R. — carried out a series of attacks on neo-Nazis in the eastern states of Thuringia and Saxony between 2018 and 2020, including two attacks on Leon R., a notorious far-right extremist who was himself arrested for allegedly forming a far-right extremist organization.
The group around Lina E. is believed to have raided a well-known neo-Nazi bar in the town of Eisenach in late 2019 and attacked Leon R. with hammers and batons. When the initial attack failed, the group attacked him again a few weeks later outside his car. Other neo-Nazis were left with broken bones and other injuries after the attacks.
Much of the prosecution's case rested on the testimony of a member of her group who turned state's witness: thirty-year-old Johannes D., who said before the Dresden Higher Regional Court that the four defendants had trained specifically for attacks on right-wing extremists. But later allegedly said that it was merely a matter of normal martial arts training for physical exercise. 
The level of planning was key to the prosecution's case, as the accusation that Lina E. was the leader of a criminal organization rested on arguments that the attacks were specially trained for. 
The case has created plenty of political tension, with the defense and far-left scenes in Lina E.'s home city of Leipzig saying that she has been scapegoated as a left-wing terrorist by both the media and the authorities. Many allege that the justice system is too lenient on neo-Nazi perpetrators.
""Free Lina"" signs and collection boxes for her defense fund have been put out in the Leipzig district of Connewitz, a left-wing hub where Lina E. herself lived. 
But Hendrik Hansen, a specialist in extremism and professor at the Federal University of Applied Administrative Sciences, argues that the media has, if anything, underestimated the dangers of left-wing extremism.
""This trial is a clear success,"" Hansen told DW. ""In the area around Leipzig we are facing the rise of clandestine structures that are very well networked in the left-wing extremist scene, and who are using methods that they have not used before.""
Hansen said Lina E.'s group could clearly be classified as a criminal organization, and could well be described as terrorist: ""This was a whole group of people planning attacks so minutely that they were using the appropriate technology, like disposable mobile phones. They had scouts, who spied on the victims. The tasks within the group were very precisely divided up.""
Hansen said that the evidence showed that the group was not merely planning street-fighting methods, but targeted assaults aimed at seriously injuring or even killing their victims. ""Terrorism is defined as using politically motivated violence to spread fear and horror either within the general population or within a certain group of people,"" he said.
Lina E. was born in Kassel, central Germany, she showed interest in a career as a social worker working with disadvantaged youth, and during her studies wrote about how to deal with far-right radicalization among young people.
Kassel is located in the state of Hesse, which has a large far-right scene, and in 2006 the city was the scene of one of the 10 murders carried out by the right-wing terrorist group the National Socialist Underground (NSU). Lina E. is reported to have become politicized by the uncovering of the NSU in 2011, which caused major controversy and investigations across Germany about law enforcement and intelligence failures.
She has now spent the last two and a half years since her arrest in the same prison in Chemnitz where the only known surviving NSU member, Beate Zschäpe, is also imprisoned.

https://www.dw.com/en/china-shenzhou-16-mission-reaches-tiangong-space-station/a-65767135,SCIENCE,China: Shenzhou-16 mission reaches Tiangong space station 30.05.2023,"China sent three astronauts, including a civilian, to its Tiangong space station on Tuesday as part of a crew rotation, according to state media.
This is China's fifth manned mission to its now fully functional space station since 2021. It's also the first time China has sent a civilian into orbit.
Officials from the space program announced that the spacecraft had docked with the Tiangong space station after a six-and-a-half-hour flight.
The crew included Jing Haipeng as the leading commander on the mission, as well as engineer Zhu Yangzhu and Beihang University professor Gui Haichao, the first Chinese civilian to travel to space.
Gui will be serving as the payload specialist on the mission and will manage experiments at the Tiangong space station.
The crew on the spacecraft, Shenzhou-16, or ""Divine Vessel,"" took off atop a Long March-2F rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre which is located in the Gobi Desert in northwest China.
The launch was a ""complete success"" and the ""astronauts are in good condition,"" said Zou Lipeng, director of the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.
The Tiangong space station is key to China's ""space dream"" and was developed after the US barred NASA from engaging with China.
China has been actively pursuing its plans to send a crewed mission to the moon and build a moon base by the end of the decade.
The station holds several state-of-the-art pieces of equipment, including ""the world's first space-based cold atomic clock system,"" state news agency Xinhua reported.
China has already announced that it will expand its permanently inhabited space station. In the future, the Chinese space program also aims to welcome foreign astronauts to visit the station. 
Tuesday's liftoff is the first mission to Tiangong since it entered its ""application and development"" stage, authorities said.
The Shenzhou-16 crew will replace the three-member crew of the Shenzhou-15 which was sent to the space station in November last year.
China is expected to send another manned mission to the space outpost later this year.

https://www.dw.com/en/stolpersteine-commemorating-victims-of-nazi-persecution/a-65770610,CULTURE,'Stolpersteine': Commemorating victims of Nazi persecution 30.05.2023,"""Stolperstein"" is a German word meaning, literally, ""stumbling stone,"" or, metaphorically, ""stumbling block."" 
Each of the brass plaques embedded in pavements recalls the fate of a person who was persecuted by the Nazis, deported, murdered or driven to suicide.
Gunter Demnig and his team place the plaques on sidewalks in front of the last address where victims of Nazi persecution lived voluntarily. So far, 100,000 Stolpersteine have been installed in 27 European countries.
The latest Stolperstein, installed on May 26, honors Johann Wild, a firefighter from Nuremberg. He was executed for writing letters in which he denounced the Nazi regime.
Demnig launched his project in Cologne in 1996, illegally, without official permission.
The first plaque was placed on the anniversary of the so-called Auschwitz Decree issued by Heinrich Himmler, one of the main people responsible for the Holocaust.
With the decree, the former Reichsführer SS ordered the deportation of all Sinti and Roma living in the German Reich. Demnig's Stolpersteine are a private form of remembrance, separate from the state culture of remembrance in Germany.  
""The Stolpersteine are my life's work,"" says the 75-year-old sculptor. He lives with his wife Katja in central Hesse, western Germany. His trademark is a wide-brimmed brown cowboy hat. In the beginning, he laid the 10-by-10-centimeter (4-by-4 inch) cubes himself, but now other people are getting involved. The names and fates of the victims are engraved on the brass plaques.
The artist remembers many of the stories behind the plaques. ""At one laying ceremony, two sisters came,"" he says. ""One came from Colombia, the other from Scotland. Both had been saved by the Kindertransport [an organized rescue effort for children from Nazi-controlled territory], but their parents were murdered. They hadn't seen each other in 60 years and said, 'Now we're reunited with our parents.'"" Demnig says, covering his eyes with his hand and fighting back tears. Such encounters have made him realize the meaning of his initiative, he adds.
These days, the new Stolpersteine are initiated by historical societies, citizens' initiatives, or school projects. A plaque costs €132 ($142), inclusing having it laid.
The idea behind the Stolpersteine is that people walking along will see the bronze plaque and stop, curious to know whom it commemorates and what happened to them. That's the effect Demnig hopes to achieve. The artist is convinced that ""there's a difference between a teenager opening a book and reading about 6 million murdered Jews, and them learning about the fate of a family while standing where they lived.""
But some people, including representatives of Jewish organizations, are critical of the project. Charlotte Knobloch, a leader of the Jewish community in Munich, says that by putting the plaques in the pavement, Demnig is allowing the victims' fates to literally be stepped all over.
The artist rejects that criticism out of hand, calling it an ""unspeakable counterargument."" He says that statements of that kind trivialize Nazi atrocities and mock the victims: ""The Nazis weren't content to simply trample their victims. They had a targeted extermination program,"" says Demnig.
The originator of the Stolpersteine won't let the objections to his project — which even go as far as death threats — deter him from continuing his mission.
Gunter Demnig says he wants to call attention to Nazi crimes, wherever they were committed. And he wants to give the victims of the Holocaust back their names and their dignity, and make sure they will not be forgotten.

https://www.dw.com/en/why-a-german-museum-is-putting-two-nazi-sculptures-on-show/a-64360206,CULTURE,Why a German museum is putting two Nazi sculptures on show 29.05.2023,"Nazi artist Josef Thorak created the two ""Striding Horses"" (known in German as ""Schreitende Pferde"") for Adolf Hitler's New Reich Chancellery in Berlin.
Now the sculptures will be shown again for the first time in the Spandau Citadel. One of the horses has been on display there for some time, and the second one is now being unveiled and examined by restorers.
On the Day of the Open Monument on September 10, 2023, it will be permanently presented again for the first time, according to the museum, along with other problematic works of art.
Commissioned by Hitler at the height of his power, the colossal twin ""Striding Horses"" had stood in the garden of Hitler's seat of government from 1939 to 1943. They were part of the thousands of bronze works crafted for the Nazi regime in its quest to transform Berlin into the imperial global capital of ""Germania.""
Josef Thorak was born in Vienna on February 7, 1889 and attended the Vienna Art Academy, eventually moving on to the Berlin Art Academy in 1915. After his studies he established himself as a sculptor of monumental works such as the 4-meter-high (13-foot) gable figure for the Reichsbank building in the western German city of Buer.
His style secured him numerous government commissions, and he became known internationally when he worked on, among others, the Security Monument in Ankara, Turkey, in 1934.
From 1937 onward, Thorak became one of the preferred sculptors of the Nazis, commissioned to create countless propaganda sculptures emphasizing the supposed strength and glory of the regime.
While Hitler and his regime persecuted Jewish and modern artists who they claimed produced ""degenerate art"" and looted the collections of Jewish art collectors, Thorak flourished. He divorced his Jewish wife and accepted a prestigious position at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts. After the end of World War II, he continued to create unchallenged until his death in 1952.
The ""Striding Horses"" were only rediscovered in 2015 after a spectacular raid on an underground art trading ring operating in Germany. Police secured the horse statues, as well as sculptures by Fritz Klimsch and Arno Breker, two more of Hitler's favorite artists.
The works were probably intended to be sold on the black market, because Nazi art remains taboo on the official market, as art historian Christian Fuhrmeister told DW in 2015. ""There are some private collectors in Germany, in the US or in Russia, there are people who are enthusiastic about it,"" he said.










According to the official website of the Spandau Citadel, a former Renaissance fortress turned exhibition space, the purpose of displaying the sculptures is to illuminate how ""the respective state powers wanted to shape the Berlin cityscape"" through the monuments they commissioned. The collection features monuments created from 1849 to 1986, covering the German Reich, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany and East Germany.
Stating on its website that the sculptures are ""testimonies to German history,"" the museum has deemed the featured monuments ""important symbols"" of German history. The adjective ""important"" may raise some eyebrows, but the museum explains it is aiming to transform itself into a center for the study of ""toxic"" monuments. The federal government has also supported the acquisition of the ""Striding Horses."" 
 
Previously, the display of Nazi art has led to fierce protest. Last year, the Pinakothek in Munich was slammed in an open letter for displaying a painting by Adolf Ziegler, another Nazi artist. Georg Baselitz, one of the world's most influential living artists, called for it to be removed. 
""It is shocking that Nazi propaganda is possible in this grubby way in a Munich museum,"" Baselitz wrote last October. He added that it was ""unbearable"" that works by artists who were persecuted by the Nazis hung next to the work of an artist responsible for their persecution.









In fact, plenty of Nazi propaganda sculptures remain in public spaces, such as in Berlin's Olympic Stadium, commissioned by the Nazi regime for the 1936 Olympics. Ahead of the World Cup in 2006, for which the stadium was one of the venues, some activists called for the removal of its statues. However, the city refused on the grounds that a removal would be a denial of Germany's history.

https://www.dw.com/en/reclaiming-the-history-of-ukrainian-art/a-65719217,CULTURE,Reclaiming the history of Ukrainian art 28.05.2023,"On a Monday afternoon in Cologne, Ukrainian curator Yuliia Berdiiaro­va meets me at the rear entrance of Museum Ludwig. The museum, next to the main train station and Cologne cathedral, is closed to the public on Mondays.
Berdiiarova, a 29-year-old art historian, worked at the Odesa Fine Arts Museum and the Mystetskyi Arsenal in Kyiv before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
In her role at Museum Ludwig, she has organized a school vacation program for Ukrainian refugee children and their parents. She also conducts research into Ukrainian modernism, which had previously been falsely attributed to the Russian avant-garde.
Berdiiarova offers to show me some of the artworks that will be displayed from June 3 as part of the exhibition, ""Modernism in Ukraine 1900-1930s."" The curator has been part of the Museum Ludwig team for almost a year, and she's helping to prepare this show.
Many of the works in this extensive exhibition, previously on show in Madrid, were removed from Ukraine due to the war, and had never before been displayed outside the country. The exhibition is completed by works that have been taken out of Museum Ludwig's storage.
We take the stairs to the first floor and walk through the museum, which is mostly empty. Berdiiarova says museums without people make her sad. ""A lot of museums (in Ukraine) are still closed,"" she says. ""It's a place for dialogue sometimes. It's a place for relief, to feel connection with history, to feel connection with other people.""
Even in Cologne, Russia's war in Ukraine is ever-present for Berdiiarova. But she knows she's one of the lucky ones. Her position at Museum Ludwig and her stay in Cologne are financed by three different foundations. But last June, when she left Odesa, where she'd worked as a museum curator for six years, she didn't know what was next. She took a step into the unknown.
""It was a very hard decision to leave Odesa,"" she says. ""I don't want to call it an adventure because adventure is something good, but it was not an adventure in a good way. It was just like a step into nothing. I had a really small bag. That was all.""
That bag contained nothing more than her documents, ID and the most essential clothes. Berdiiarova has since had some of her clothes sent to her from Ukraine, and before me stands a stylish woman all in black: A turtleneck top, a suit, sunglasses. She says, with a wink, that she tries to look the part of a typical museum curator, inspired by the famous Kasimir Malevich painting, ""Black Square.""
Berdiiarova would have preferred to stay in Ukraine. She says that in the first few months of the war, she and her colleagues initially took works from the museum in Odesa to safety, but then life there became impossible.
She fled across to Warsaw, from where she continued first to Berlin, then to Cologne. Ukrainian colleagues sent her information about a program for Ukrainian curators in Germany from the Ernst Siemens Foundation.
She hasn't abandoned her homeland in Cologne; on the contrary, she says she's fighting in her own way: with words. At Museum Ludwig, she's corrected all the names of Ukrainian artists. ""First, we freed the spelling of the cities from their Russian spelling. That was part of the Soviet Union's culture of appropriation, to Russify names of cities and people. We made Kharkov into Kharkiv again. The names were transliterated from the Russian alphabet into the Latin alphabet. And I'm very proud that Museum Ludwig agreed to the corrections.""
So, the Ukrainian artist Alexander Bogomazov is now Oleksandr Bohomazov and the Ukrainian capital is now spelled ""Kyiv.""
The war has now helped familiarize the public with Ukraine and its art history – thanks in part to Berdiiarova's work. She combed through the Museum Ludwig's collection and not only came across names of Ukrainian artists whose names still had the Russian spellings, she also corrected national affiliations.
Kazimir Malevich, for instance, ""had a Ukrainian passport during the Soviet era, where it was written that he was Ukrainian."" Berdiiarova adds that he spent a significant portion of his career as a professor at the Kyiv Academy of Arts, and published texts in Ukrainian magazines. She says that Malevich's Ukrainian identity was suppressed, so he was always considered a representative of the Russian avant-garde.
Other Ukrainian artists, like Vasyl Yermilov, were also co-opted by the Russian avant-garde. The artist was born in Kharkiv in 1894 but was considered a representative of the Russian Constructivist movement. Now, on the initiative of Yuliia Berdiiarova, his works hang in a new context – alongside works by Piet Mondrian and Kazimir Malevich. ""Late, but justice all the same,"" Berdiiarova says proudly. 
""We are trying to understand how the concept of the Russian avant-garde was part of the system of appropriation of culture in the post-imperialist area, and why it has so much power,"" she said. ""Why was the imperialist background of the Soviet Union overlooked for so long in the first place? These are all very long processes.""
So, along with numerous colleagues, she is compiling a list of all the Ukrainian artists in collections worldwide. The list is intended to prove how diverse the Ukrainian art landscape has been, and how Russian propaganda denied it a place in art history.
Even though she feels at home in Cologne – and the modern ""Crane Houses"" along the Rhine remind her of motifs from constructivist paintings, as she recounts with a smile – she also feels very lonely. So she wants to return to Odesa when her program ends, even though the war will probably not be over by then. ""Odesa is my home. It's just too hard to be so far away. Sometimes it feels safer to be with your people, even when bombs are falling.""",Arts
https://www.dw.com/en/museums-struggle-to-embrace-diversity-in-new-documentary/a-65740530,ARTS,Museums struggle to embrace diversity in new documentary 27.05.2023,"In December 2019, Rein Wolfs took over as director of the renowned Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam and quickly set about making its collection and staff more diverse and inclusive.
Along for the ride was filmmaker Sarah Vos, who for three years captured this pioneering effort by a major cultural institution to effect greater diversity in its halls.    
Her camera observed as Wolfs, formerly the director of the Bundeskunsthalle in Bonn in Germany, worked with museum staff to evaluate the range of the collection and the exhibition concepts.
The sobering conclusion was that less than 10% of works in the collection are by women. Works by artists who were Black, Indigenous or People of Color (BIPOC) were rarely seen.
The resulting documentary, ""White Balls on Walls,"" not only questions the level of diversity in the museum, but goes deeper to understand the function of art in society.
In the past, cultural institutions had ""not thought enough outside the box,"" Wolfs told DW.
By contrast, Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum  now wants to think more globally, and, for instance, align its diversity concept with the population structure of Amsterdam.
""After all, we want everyone to have the opportunity to also find their own history and their own moments of identification,"" he said. 
The discussion about a new concept raises questions: Can and should diversity be quantified through words or quotas? Should the origin and gender of artists play a role in the evaluation of art? 
The Stedelijk team agreed on a quota: From 2021 to 2024, at least 50% of the acquisition budget should be spent on works by BIPOC artists. There are no fixed quotas for works by women, but gender is a factor in the selection process.
Moreover, there is at least one large annual exhibition of BIPOC artists or a group exhibition that addresses diversity, Wolf said.
Diversity plays an inherent role in ethnological museums featuring artifacts and art from all over the world, including at Frankfurt's Museum of World Cultures. 
The museum focuses on the art of Indigenous people who are themselves minorities in their home countries, museum director Eva Raabe said. Works by women, children and queer people are a further focus of the collection and exhibits.  
Raabe said it wasn't not about specific quotas, but rather about the statement artists want to make with their works.
""Through their art, which is an expression of their opinions, their needs, their lives, they tell us about the reality of their lives,"" she said.
By including a wide variety of perspectives, the selection is inherently diverse, she adds. 
Meanwhile, Berliin's KINDL — Centre for Contemporary Art strives for a ""highly diversified exhibition program,"" director Kathrin Becker told DW. 
""I also have a personal mission here, which I share with many colleagues in Berlin and elsewhere, and that is to achieve a multitude of voices in the presentation of contemporary art,"" Becker said. 
Gender identity, as well as ethnic and socioeconomic background, are important in this regard, she added.

So how are artists responding to the debate about diversity in art and museums? Whom do quotas actually help?
""I would find it almost insulting if the Stedelijk were to do an exhibition of my work just because they are looking for BIPOC artists,""Surinamese-Dutch artist Remy Jungerman says in ""White Balls on Walls.""
Wolfs, however, said he was not aware of artists not wanting to exhibit their work at the Stedelijk because of the quotas. 
But the museum director is not surprised by criticism of Stedelijk's strategy for more inclusivity, and has heard accusations that the museum is putting its political agenda before art.
""We're seen as ‘woke,' and that's a dirty word these days. We get a lot of praise, but we also get a lot of criticism,"" he said. ""But that's kind of a part of this institution; we're a museum that's always very much on the front lines.""
The museum director sees a shift toward more diversity almost everywhere, not only in museums but in cultural policy and in social movements.
Kathrin Becker of Berlin's KINDL — Centre for Contemporary Art said museum directors were increasingly trying to counter ""very Western and Eurocentric"" collections with ""new ideas,"" including by ""inviting artists who don't represent Western art."" 
So how can museums become more diverse?
Whether diversity in the museum is ensured with quotas, is achieved through dialogue with artists or is created in multiperspective exhibitions, awareness of the issue appears to be driving change.
As Eva Raabe of Frankfurt's Museum of World Cultures surmises: ""You can actually always do more to give smaller groups a voice.""",Arts
https://www.dw.com/en/us-charges-2-over-chinese-plot-against-falun-gong-movement/a-65751437,POLITICS,US charges 2 over Chinese plot against Falun Gong movement 27.05.2023,"Two Los Angeles residents have been charged in connection with an alleged Chinese plot against the anti-communist spiritual movement, the US Justice Department on Friday.
US authorities accuse the duo of bribing an undercover agent posing as a US tax agent on behalf of Beijing to target the New York-based organization.
The two were arrested on Friday and charged with acting as unregistered agents of a foreign government, bribing a public official and conspiring to commit international money laundering. 
One of them is a 70-year-old US citizen and the other is a 43-year-old permanent US resident.
A complaint against the two was filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York, the Justice Department said.
According to the indictment, the suspects conspired to bribe an employee of the US tax agency IRS to get him to investigate the Falun Gong organization and revoke its tax-exempt status.
Prosecutors said the undercover officer, who was posing as the tax agent, recorded multiple conversations with one of the suspects, during which they discussed instructions allegedly received from Chinese government officials.
The suspect referred to these officials as ""blood brothers"" and expressed Beijing's willingness to reward the undercover officer for helping crack down on Falun Gong's non-profit status.
""The Chinese government has yet again attempted, and failed, to target critics of the [People's Republic of China] here in the United States,"" Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said in a statement.
Garland added that the US will ""continue to investigate, disrupt, and prosecute"" China's efforts to ""silence its critics"" based in the US.
Falun Gong, a movement that centers around meditation practices, was banned by China in 1999 after 10,000 members appeared at the central leadership compound in Beijing in silent protest.
The group has called for people to renounce the ruling Chinese Communist Party.
China's government has described the group as a cult organization that threatens national stability.
It has found refuge in a 400-acre compound called Dragon Springs in upstate New York.
In the US, it is primarily known for its ties to the Shen Yun performing arts group and The Epoch Times newspaper, which reports news from China often censored by the Chinese government.
The latest development comes a month after the US government charged two Chinese nationals with operating a ""secret police station"" in New York City on behalf of the government of China.
Around the same time, approximately 36 officers from China's national police force were indicted by federal prosecutors for utilizing social media platforms to intimidate dissidents residing in the US.
In 2020, the US government also filed charges against six individuals for acting on behalf of the Chinese government, exerting pressure on a New Jersey resident in order to compel his return to China and face legal charges there.

https://www.dw.com/en/political-visionary-or-warmonger-henry-kissinger-turns-100/a-65729851,POLITICS,Political visionary or warmonger? Henry Kissinger turns 100 26.05.2023,"After a visit to the Palace of Versailles outside of Paris in the 1970s, journalists asked Henry Kissinger what it was like in the majestic Hall of Mirrors, to which he responded it was ""wonderful"" as he was ""surrounded by genius.""
For supporters, Henry Kissinger is indeed a diplomatic genius who continues to master the art of discerning the politically achievable like no other. For critics, he is a  war criminal. For most, he and his political legacy fall somewhere in between.
During Kissinger's time first as a foreign policy adviser and later as secretary of state to Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, he contributed to ending the Vietnam War, entering a détente with the Soviet Union, opening US relations with China, overthrowing a democratically elected leader and redrawing the borders of several countries. After leaving office, he went on to offer ""geopolitical consulting"" to scores of undisclosed international leaders with his Kissinger Associates consulting firm.
Even 100 years after he was born Heinz Alfred Kissinger to a Jewish family in the Bavarian city of Fürth, Kissinger is seen as an international foreign policy heavyweight and contributes his views on geopolitical issues.
He has often warned of the dangers artificial intelligence pose for the world. Putting AI into the same league as the danger from nuclear weapons, he warns his younger peers that this is a ""totally new problem."" Quite a warning by a man who has seen it all.
On Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Kissinger created a furor by calling for a negotiated peace in November. His appeal came at a point when Ukraine's Western allies had only just started substantively ramping up their military assistance to Kyiv. 
While Kissinger argued imminent talks were necessary to avoid another devastating world war, Kyiv accused him of ""appeasing the aggressor.""
Ken Lieberthal, who worked with Kissinger on several occasions over the past decades, said the centenarian has ""a clear view of what needs to be done"" and ""how to get from here to there."" Kissinger's approach requires ""an unsentimental assessment of capabilities,"" Lieberthal explained. A devoted proponent of Realpolitik, Kissinger himself described his thinking about conflict in an even more straightforward manner: ""the ends justify the means.""
Ukraine's criticism leaves Kissinger unfazed. When it comes to dealing with Russia, Kissinger, who masterminded America's détente policy in the 70s, can point to having been at the edge of war with Russia himself. Later he described detente as ""a strategy for conducting the conflict with the Soviet Union"" that bought both sides time for diplomacy and avoiding a hot conflict.
In a rare change of mind, he now backs Ukraine's future membership in NATO after he concluded that ""the idea of a neutral Ukraine in these conditions"" was ""no longer meaningful.""
But his willingness to see principles of international law and human rights not as paramount, but simply one factor in his policy equations has human rights advocates around the world on edge as soon as they hear his name. US Senator Bernie Sanders, a leader of America's political Left, said he was ""proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend"" calling him the ""most destructive secretary of state in modern history"" over his policies in Asia in the 1970s.
Kissinger has described his often controversial take on strategic leadership as ""traversing a tightrope"" that is ""suspended between the relative certainties of the past and the ambiguities of the future.""
Kissinger has written extensively on his decision-making process. It saw him initially hide the bombing of Cambodia from the US public. The US aimed to defeat the Viet Cong there but ended up enabling the murderous rise of the Khmer Rouge, which is estimated to have killed more than 2 million people. He had aimed to secure a cease-fire that would end the Vietnam War.  Both, he and his North Vietnamese counterpart, Le Duc Tho, were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their plan. Only Kissinger accepted the award, and he tried to return the Prize when the attempt at a negotiated peace spectacularly failed with the fall of Saigon. Decisions he took along the way cost tens of thousands of lives in Vietnam, Cambodia and neighboring Laos. 
Whenever Kissinger speaks publicly, which he still does to this day, there is no doubt that he is aware and unafraid of the grave consequences action entails. National Archive documents from the 70s, released 40 years later, proved that he pressed Nixon into overthrowing the democratically elected President Salvador Allende in 1973 because he felt Chile's ""model effect can be insidious"" for US interest in the region. By doing so, Kissinger effectively enabled the rise of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet whose government killed and tortured thousands of people. 
""He always thought in terms of a kind of balance of power,"" Lieberthal said of Kissinger's support for interventions in what should have been democratic processes.
According to Lieberthal, Kissinger was driven by the calculation that ""dominance by one country would produce efforts by others."" Avoiding the instability such a chain reaction could produce led Kissinger to broker Nixon's historic recognition of China in 1972, a policy that continues to bind the US to a commitment that ""Taiwan is part of China."" 
The tensions currently playing out in the Taiwan Strait and the fear of a war over Taiwan mark the extension of  Kissinger's US foreign policy leadership from the 70s into the present day. Kissinger can claim to have recognized the trajectory of China toward a global power and systemic rival decades ahead of most of his peers.
While Kissinger celebrates his 100th birthday on Saturday (27.5.2023), politicians and scholars around the world will continue to debate the importance and impact of the policies passionately advocated by an American legend whose accented English continues to reveal his German roots.

https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-updates-scholz-will-speak-to-putin-in-due-course/a-65740385,CONFLICTS,Ukraine updates: Scholz will speak to Putin 'in due course' 26.05.2023,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed openness to speaking directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin in an interview published on Friday.
The remarks come amid strained ties between Russia and Germany following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Scholz and Putin held their last phone call in December 2022. The conversation lasted an hour, where Scholz urged Putin to withdraw his country's troops from Ukraine, while the Russian president accused the West of pursuing ""destructive"" policies in the region.
""My last telephone call was some time ago,"" Scholz told the Koelner Stadt-Anzeiger newspaper in an interview. ""But I plan to speak to Putin again in due course.""
Scholz also said Germany would continue to ""actively support Ukraine,"" but ""at the same time prevent a direct conflict between NATO and Russia.""
""And never to act alone, but in close coordination with our friends and allies,"" he added.
On the subject of a possible negotiation to end the war, Scholz said Putin had to understand that the war could not be ended by making ""some kind of cold peace"" that would turn ""the current frontline into the new 'border' between Russia and Ukraine.""
""It is about a fair peace, and the prerequisite for that is the withdrawal of Russian troops,"" Scholz said. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin is ready for a new telephone call with Scholz.
""It is necessary to talk,"" Peskov said. ""President Putin remains open to dialogue, but of course pursues the fundamental goal of protecting the interests of our citizens.""

Here are some of the other developments concerning Russia's war in Ukraine on Friday, May 26:
Ukrainian officials say at least two people were killed and 30 others were wounded in a Russian missile strike on a clinic in the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro. 
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the attack a ""crime against humanity,"" as his government deemed it a serious war crime under the Geneva Conventions. 
Rescue workers and a devastated building with smoke pouring out of it could be seen in a video of the attack's aftermath. Most of the upper floor of the building was badly damaged, along with nearby vehicles. 
""Another (Russian) missile attack, another crime against humanity,"" Zelenskiy wrote on Twitter.  
""The buildings of a psychological clinic and a veterinary clinic in the city of Dnipro were destroyed,"" he added. 
Russia did not immediately comment on the events in Dnipro. In the past, Moscow has rejected allegations that its soldiers have committed war crimes, saying its military does not target civilians. Russian airstrikes, however, often hit civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings and medical facilities. 

The European Union condemned an agreement between Russia and Belarus to allow the deployment of Russian nuclear warheads in Belarus.
""This is a step which will lead to further extremely dangerous escalation,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement.
Russia moved ahead on Thursday with its plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, whose leader said the warheads were already on the move. The plan was announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin in March.
Borrell said the decision contravened multiple international agreements. ""We call on Russia to abide by these commitments,"" he said.
""The Belarusian regime is an accomplice in Russia’s illegal and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine,"" Borrell added.
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said he had a phone call with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and reaffirmed his willingness to establish peace talks with both sides of the war in Ukraine.
""I reiterated Brazil's willingness, along with India, Indonesia and China, to talk to both sides of the conflict in pursuit of peace,"" Lula added, after also discussing the matter with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this week.
Lula tweeted he had also thanked Putin for an invitation to attend an economic forum in Saint Petersburg, but had to decline it as he ""can't visit Russia at the moment.""
The Kremlin confirmed the call and said Putin told Lula that Russia is open to dialogue over Ukraine.
Lula has pitched himself as a peace broker to end the war, which began when Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022.
His proposal, based on Brazil's tradition of non-intervention and neutrality, calls for a group of nations not involved in the war to engage both Russia and Ukraine in talks.
The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense said that it needs 48 F-16 fighter jets to free Ukraine from the Russian occupation. ""Four squadrons of F-16s (48 aircraft) are exactly what we need to rid our country of the aggressor,"" the ministry said on Twitter. 
Meanwhile, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that the Netherlands is ""seriously considering"" sending F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine but has not taken any final decision yet.
Rutte told a news conference no final decision had been taken on sending the jets, but added that ""if you start training it's obvious that is something you are seriously considering.""
Last Friday, US President Joe Biden cleared the way for a coalition of allies to supply Ukraine with the fighter jets at the most recent G7 summit in Japan. He gave the green light for Ukrainian pilots to start being trained on the jets. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the F-16s would send a clear signal of strength to Russia and promised to use the jets solely for defense purposes.

The German government has put in an order for 18 new Leopard 2A8 main battle tanks, manufacturer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) said. 
The framework agreement includes options for an additional 105 of the Leopard 2A8, the latest version of the tank. On Wednesday, parliament's budget committee approved €525 million ($562 million) for the order. 
The first batch will replace the 18 Leopard 2A6 tanks that Germany has given to Ukraine. According to Munich-based KMW, delivery is expected to commence in 2025. 
Twelve self-propelled howitzers were also ordered from KMW. An option agreement for the howitzers, which are also being used by the Ukrainian forces, was concluded in March.

UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi is set to brief the UN Security Council next week on his proposal to safeguard Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. 
Zaporizhzhia is Europe's largest nuclear power plants, located in Ukraine's southeast. Its safety has been a concern since Russian forces seized it over a year ago.  
The plant has been subject to frequent shelling, causing several power outages vital to cooling the plant's reactors. 
Fears have increased that a nuclear disaster could occur amid increased military activity, while both Kyiv and Moscow have repeatedly accused each other of attacking the plant. 
Grossi last visited the facility in March, and in a press release last week he urged that ""it is very simple: don't shoot at the plant and don't use the plant as a military base."" 
""It should be in the interest of everyone to agree on a set of principles to protect the plant during the conflict,"" Grossi added. 
Chinese Special Envoy for Eurasian Affairs Li Hui has arrived at the Russian Foreign Ministry for talks with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Russian media reported.
Prior to the trip to Moscow, Li had been in Europe to discuss possible a possible ""political settlement"" to resolve the conflict.
While Beijing has said it is a neutral party on the Ukraine war, it has been criticized for refusing to condemn Moscow's invasion.
European politicians have reacted with skepticism to China's list of proposals that Beijing claims would secure peace in Ukraine.
Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said the conflict in Ukraine could last for decades and that negotiations with Ukraine were impossible as long as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in power, Russian news agencies reported. 
""Everything always ends in negotiations, and this is inevitable, but as long as these people are in power, the situation for Russia will not change in terms of negotiations,"" said Medvedev, who is also a former president and prime minister.  
He also warned that the West was seriously underestimating the risk of a nuclear war over Ukraine. Medvedev said Russia would launch a pre-emptive strike if Ukraine were to obtain nuclear weapons.   
""The Anglo-Saxons do not fully realize this and believe that it will not come to this. It will under certain conditions,"" he added. 
As Ukraine became independent after the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union, it inherited  thousands of nuclear weapons from the Soviet stockpile.   
But Kyiv handed these to Russia under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in return for a guarantees of its security and sovereignty from Russia, the US and the UK. 
Ukraine said it shot down 10 missiles and over 20 drones launched by Russia in overnight attacks on the capital Kyiv. 
The defensive action was also carried out over the city of Dnipro and eastern regions, Ukrainian officials said on Friday.
It comes as Russia has increased its missile and drone attacks on Ukraine, seeking to cripple logistics and infrastructure facilities.
A total of 17 missiles and 31 drones were launched during the attacks, which started at around 10:00 p.m. (1900 GMT) on Thursday and continued until 5:00 a.m. on Friday, with several of them hitting targets in the Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, officials said.
The Manege exhibition hall near Moscow's Red Square has hosted an exhibition depicting Russia's military through the centuries, as the images intend to promote Moscow's campaign in Ukraine.
The Kremlin has encouraged artwork emphasizing Russia's fighting spirit and the message that Moscow is fighting a defensive conflict against Kyiv and its allies.
In one of the paintings, called ""We are Russians, God is with us,"" by patriotic artist Vasily Nesterenko, a young woman can be seen carrying Russia's flag and a bullet proof vest with the Z sign used by Russian troops in Ukraine.
The 56-year-old artist Nesterenko has received numerous awards from Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Being in the military is for life, like being an artist,"" Nesterenko said.
But at the same time, other artists who have been critical of Russia's war have faced repression, while many officials in leading state cultural institutions have chosen to remain silent over Ukraine in recent months.
Japan announced fresh sanctions against Russia targeting its military as well as the construction and engineering sectors.
Tokyo's latest round follows the G7 summit last week in Hiroshima, where the bloc's leaders agreed to ""starve Russia of G7 technology, industrial equipment and services that support its war machine.""
Included in the new package are ""an asset freeze of Russian individuals and groups, a ban on the export of goods to Russia's military-related organizations, and a ban on the export of construction and engineering services to Russia,"" top government spokesman Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters.
The freeze targets 17 individuals and 78 groups, including high-level military officials, while the 80 organizations hit with export restrictions include the Russian mobile phone operator MegaFon, officials added.
Ukraine announced another prisoner exchange with Russia, which resulted in 106 Ukrainian soldiers being freed.
""It is very important that there was no information about many of these 106 people at all — they were considered missing,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address. 
""But we found them. We brought them back home,"" he added. The soldiers are said to have been fighting in the Bakhmut region. 
""Everyone on the frontline should remember this: the more Russian prisoners of war we will take, the more of our people we will return,"" Zelensky said.
Belarus's autocratic leader Alexander Lukashenko has announced the signing of a decree that would allow Russia to deploy tactical, shorter-range nuclear weapons in the country.

https://www.dw.com/en/tina-turner-remembering-the-queen-of-rock-n-roll/a-65726509,MUSIC,Tina Turner: Remembering the 'Queen of Rock 'n' Roll' 24.05.2023,"A bundle of energy donning high heels, a miniskirt and a lion-like mane of hair: That's how fans knew rock queen Tina Turner. She also had that deep, smoky voice with which she wrote music history, and which secured her a spot as one of the greatest musicians of all time.
Celebrating her final world tour in 2009, Tina Turner gave her last concert on May 5, in Sheffield, England, naturally in front of a sold-out audience. Then, at the age of 69, her career in the limelight was finally over. ""It was a great show, really wonderful,"" she said years later in a rare interview with the BBC.
The next day she took a deep breath and decided: ""That was it. There's no way I'm going back."" For more than 50 years, she had spent almost every night on a bus, plane, in a car or a hotel. ""There was only that life for me. And at some point, I didn't want to dance and sing anymore. I wanted to be at home and be normal.""
""Home"" was a villa near Küsnacht on Lake Zurich, where she had lived since the 1990s. The over one-acre estate in Switzerland, which she named ""Algonquin"" after her Native American grandmother, was a place where Tina enjoyed her retreat from show business alongside her German husband Erwin Bach.
For a long time, it remained a secret that she had been seriously ill in her later years of life. She survived a stroke, suffered from colon cancer and received a kidney transplant. The organ was donated by her husband in 2017, but before that, she had been dependent on dialysis for many years.
Nevertheless, Tina remained confident and recovered. The self-confessed Buddhist was never afraid of death. ""I don't believe in God and the Devil; that there's someone there who tells you what you did right and what you did wrong,"" she told German weekly Die Zeit in 2018. Turner was convinced that every deceased person begins a new life at some point. ""We go and take a break. And then we come back — and start over again,"" she believed. It was at her secluded home in Switzerland where the songstress reportedly passed away aged 83. 
If she was right, she certainly deserves an easy start in her next life in reincarnation. Born on November 26, 1939, as Anna Mae Bullock, she grew up on a farm in the small town of Nutbush, Tennessee, where her father worked as an overseer of cotton pickers. Racial segregation still prevailed in the US, and as a child, she had to lower her glance when speaking to a white man: ""Yes Sir, no Sir"" was the expected way of speaking. On Sundays, Anna Mae sang in the church gospel choir.
In 1955, she moved to St. Louis, where her encounter with Ike Turner, a pioneer of soul music, was to change her life. The two met in a club where the then already popular Ike was holding court with his band, Kings of Rhythm. The then 17-year-old Anna Mae spontaneously grabbed the mike and sang a B.B. King hit. It was the beginning of an unprecedented career. Ike hired her right away as a background singer for his band.
She got her big opportunity in 1960 when Art Lassiter, the lead singer of the Ike Turner Band, was supposed to record the song ""A Fool in Love."" But he failed to show, so Ike sent the young Anna Mae to the microphone instead. It was their very first hit ever, which made it to number 27 in the US charts. For promotion reasons, Ike renamed the young singer Tina without further ado, finally pulling her out of the background choir and placing her in the spotlight. From then on, they toured the country together as the Ike & Tina Turner Revue.
Ike and Tina also became a couple. The musicians married in Mexico in 1962 and had two sons together. In the professional realm, their success rose steadily. Tina's impressive voice was also noticed in Europe when she contributed to Phil Spector's pop symphony ""River Deep, Mountain High"" in 1966 — for a fee of $25,000 (€23,200).
A joint tour with the Rolling Stones, regular shows in Las Vegas, a new lucrative record deal and higher fees for live performances marked the successful years of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue; each year, they played some 270 concerts.
The song ""Proud Mary"" catapulted them into the top 10 of the US charts for the first time in 1970. The single became a million-seller and Tina received her first Grammy Award as Best Rhythm & Blues Singer.
As an artist couple, Ike and Tina Turner were inducted into the ""Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"" in 1991 — even though they had long gone their separate ways.
In her 1986 biography, I, Tina: My Life Story, the singer described their marriage as hell on Earth. Ike constantly cheated on Tina and turned out to be a tyrant who put her in the hospital several times. In 1976, she pulled the plug: After a gig in Dallas, Tina fled the hotel suite with a swollen, bruised face and just 36 cents to her name and never returned. In the divorce, she renounced all rights and joint property, only taking her stage name with her. A name that would later bring her world fame.
But at first Tina had a hard time keeping her head above water. She was in debt due to the cancelled tour with Ike, who took all the royalties. She sang in bars and at business events, and also worked as a cleaning lady: ""To be free ... well, that was wonderful! I didn't care that I didn't have any money, that I had to clean other people's houses to earn a living,"" she later recalled of this challenging period.
The big record companies had written her off at that time as an old star who could hardly be marketed. But music producer and manager Roger Davies supported Tina. He believed in her and pulled her out of her career doldrums. With the album Private Dancer, Tina stepped back into the spotlight again in 1984 at the age of 45. The released single ""What's Love Got To Do With It"" became her first No. 1 hit.
From then on, the Queen of Rock could only move upward. In the course of her more than 50-year career, Tina Turner sold around 200 million albums and won 12 Grammy Awards. In 1988, she performed at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro in front of 180,000 people — this huge audience earned her an entry into the Guinness Book of World Records.
In 1985, she met music manager Erwin Bach, who was 16 years her junior, in Cologne, Germany. Even though it was love at first sight, the two of them did not get married until 2013, in a Buddhist ceremony. That was 51 years after her marriage to Ike. The wedding guests are said to have included David Bowie, Eros Ramazotti and Giorgio Armani. In that same year Tina Turner also took on Swiss citizenship.
After her retreat from the stage, she recorded Buddhist texts for a spiritual music project. In 2018, she was a consultant for the creators of the Tina Turner Musical. That same year, her memoirs My Love Story were published. That book shows that Tina Turner was not only a wonderful singer, but also a tireless fighter.
TV star host Oprah Winfrey, Tina's longtime friend, put it in a nutshell: ""Tina, you not only sing and dance. When people see you on stage, they know that you have fought your way out of the worst despair. That means no matter how far a woman has fallen, she can make it, just like you did.""

https://www.dw.com/en/rock-icon-tina-turner-dies-aged-83/a-65651482,MUSIC,Rock icon Tina Turner dies aged 83 24.05.2023,"Tina Turner, widely known as the ""Queen of Rock 'n' Roll"" died on Wednesday at the age of 83, her representatives announced.
The US-born, Swiss-naturalized singer passed away in her home near Zurich after a long illness, her representatives said in a statement.
She was among the biggest recording artists of all time. Among her biggest hits were ""What's Love Got to Do with It"" and ""(Simply) The Best.""
Tributes have poured in from all over the world, with the lead singer of the Rolling Stones, Mick Jagger, tweeting to say he was saddened by the news.
With such a long career, Turner influenced generations of fellow musicians. Beyoncé praised the late artist with whom she performed, writing a tribute on her website.
""My beloved queen. I love you endlessly. I’m so grateful for your inspiration, and all the ways you have paved the way,"" Beyonce wrote. ""You are the epitome of power and passion. We are all so fortunate to have witnessed your kindness and beautiful spirit that will forever remain.""
Singer Lizzo dedicated her performance on Wednesday night in Phoenix, Arizona to Tina Turner:
Turner’s contemporaries have also been honoring her memory, with Dionne Warwick reflecting on a personal loss that will be shared by many:
Turner moved to Switzerland in the 1990s with her German partner Erwin Bach, whom she married in 2013.
Her official Facebook page announced her passing on Wednesday evening.
""With her music and her boundless passion for life, she enchanted millions of fans around the world and inspired the stars of tomorrow,"" the post read.
Further tributes were posted on social media by denizens of the arts and politics.
Former US president Barack Obama honored the star’s resilience on Twitter. 
That sentiment was echoed by the current president, Joe Biden:
Actor George Takei honored Turner in a Twitter post, using the lyrics from some of her most popular songs.
""She showed us that love really does has everything to do with it, and that we really did need another hero. And she was it,"" Takei wrote.
British model Naomi Campbell wrote on Instagram: ""Rest in peace and power [...] There will never be another. Cherish my times with you.""
The US space agency, NASA, said Turner ""sparkled across the stage"" and that her ""legacy will forever live among the stars.""
Turner came from humble beginnings, born in the US state of Tennessee as Anna Mae Bullock in 1939.
Her first encounter with fame came during performances alongside her former husband Ike Turner. During the 20-year relationship, she was physically and emotionally abused — later leaving the relationship and becoming one of the first celebrities to speak frankly about domestic violence.

She then became a superstar as a solo artist in her 40s, enjoying even wider success — known for her electric stage presence, powerful voice and shimmering costumes.

https://www.dw.com/en/architect-david-chipperfield-wins-2023-pritzker-prize/a-65709216,ARCHITECTURE,Architect David Chipperfield wins 2023 Pritzker Prize 24.05.2023,"The Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Japan Art Association's Praemium Imperiale, a knighthood in his native Britain: The list of honors and awards is so long that it's surprising David Chipperfield had yet to receive the Pritzker Prize.
But that will change on May 24, 2023, when the Briton receives the award — considered the Nobel Prize of architecture — for the first time in Athens, Greece.
Sir David Alan Chipperfield was born in London in 1953 and grew up on a farm in the southwest of England. He originally wanted to become a veterinarian, but his passion for architecture was ignited when his father converted another farm into vacation apartments. As young David assisted his father, he became fascinated by the design possibilities.
After studying architecture in London, Chipperfield worked at the office of legendary architect Norman Foster in the 1970s. In 1985, he founded his own company, David Chipperfield Architects.
Today, the architectural firm has offices in London, Berlin, Milan, Shanghai and Santiago de Compostela.









Chipperfield made a name for himself internationally, especially with the renovation and reconstruction of old buildings while taking into account their history and environment.
His offices have completed more than 100 projects in Asia, Europe and North America, including the reconstruction of the Procuratie Vecchie in Venice, the Museo Jumex in Mexico City, and the Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach, Germany.
David Chipperfield has realized only a few projects in Britain and has felt a certain estrangement from his homeland since Brexit. But he has developed a close connection with Berlin. In 2009, he completed the reconstruction of the German capital's Neues Museum located at the city's Museum Island, which had been severely damaged during World War II. 
Chipperfield Architects also designed and built the visitor center for the Museum Island, namely the James Simon Gallery, which opened in 2019. Its completion took seven years longer than planned.
The fact that the project ended up costing €130 million ($140 million), twice the original sum, prompted Berliners, with their characteristic irreverence, to dub it ""the most expensive coat check"" in the city.

In addition, the office was responsible for renovating the Neue Nationalgalerie from 2015 to 2021. The building, inaugurated in 1968 and built according to plans by Bauhaus master Mies van der Rohe, had significant construction defects.
When the Pritzker jury announced its choice in March 2023, it praised Chipperfield for his ""timeless modern design that confronts climate urgencies, transforms social relationships and reinvigorates cities.""
Speaking to DW, the 2023 Pritzker Prize laureate emphasized the social responsibility of his industry. 
""Architecture takes, it takes land, it takes resources, it takes energy — so then the question is, what does it give?"" He added that sustainability for too long has played a secondary role in architecture.
In 2017, Chipperfield founded the Fundacion RIA in Santiago de Compostela. Based in northern Spain, the foundation aims to harmonize construction and the environment through planning control.
He told DW that it's more energy-efficient to preserve existing buildings rather than demolish them. His stance aligns with the philosophies of previous Pritzker laureates, such as the French architectural firm Lacaton & Vassal.
Architecture must not simply work to make the world more beautiful, said Chipperfield, but also to make it more just and sustainable: ""This is the moment in the planet's history where we really have to think about how we aspire society to be.""

https://www.dw.com/en/german-diversity-day-how-inclusive-is-the-cultural-world/a-65697444,CULTURE,German Diversity Day: How inclusive is the cultural world? 23.05.2023,"









Disabilities are multifaceted. From psychological to physical disabilities, there are many variations. In film, television and the arts, people with disabilities have become increasingly present in recent years and many artists who have a disability themselves are now open about it.
From ""Game of Thrones"" star Peter Dinklage who has achondroplasia, a genetic disorder that affects bone growth to pop icon Billie Eilish, who has Tourette's syndrome, to painter Yayoi Kusama, who lives with obsessive-compulsive disorder — more and more famous actors, artists and musicians with physical or cognitive challenges are garnering space in the spotlight.
In Germany, too, things are changing in the cultural world. Jutta Schubert, a project manager at Eucrea, an association focusing on art and artists with disabilities in German-speaking countries, sees some progress. She notes that diversity today is no longer limited to people with a migration background or people's sexual orientation but also includes people with disabilities.
""In Germany, people with disabilities were completely forgotten or overlooked for a very long time,"" Schubert told DW. Part of the reason, she says, is that most federal funding programs for cultural institutions focused on other groups. ""People with disabilities have really only been at the center of the diversity issue for, I would say, one or two years.""
Today, she says, it is clear from calls for bids for artistic projects, such as those of the ""Performing Arts Fund"" or the German Federal Cultural Foundation, that the issue of diversity is being perceived more comprehensively.
""Institutions understand that they can secure financial support if they hire people with disabilities or promote accessibility,"" Schubert explains.
A new program called 'pik' was recently launched by the German Federal Cultural Foundation with the specific aim of promoting projects in this area. It aims to facilitate long-term collaborations between theaters and inclusive groups and also includes a mentoring program. ""Such a development would have been unfathomable eight or ten years ago,"" Schubert explains.
In addition, more and more cultural institutions are taking their own initiative in the area, especially in the theater sector. Schubert referred to the Munich Kammerspiele theater company, whose ensemble includes six people with disabilities. Other theaters are also showing interest in hiring people with disabilities for productions or even employing them permanently and integrating them into the ensemble.

The film industry is also paying more attention to diversity. To generate realistic portrayals, German production companies such as UFA are now using actors with disabilities. In doing so, they are referring to the EU Platform of Diversity Charters, created in 2010.
""When German production companies look for actresses or actors for roles that portray, for example, a person in a wheelchair with a migration background or someone with brittle bone disease, more attention is paid to not casting with actors without disabilities.
The German film industry has been inspired by developments in the US, where actors such as RJ Mitte (from ""Breaking Bad"") and Peter Dinklage (""Game of Thrones "") have made careers for themselves. 

Even if they do not act as activists for people with disabilities, Schubert considers them role models. ""Peter Dinklage speaks very openly about his disability and also sometimes expresses himself in interviews about what changes need to happen."" According to Schubert, this openness has a positive influence on the acceptance of people with disabilities in general society.
Apart from the theater and film industries, the museum landscape is also undergoing change. The 2017 exhibition ""Art and Alphabet"" at Hamburg's Kunsthalle is one example. It showcased the work of Harald Stoffers, a successful Hamburg painter with a cognitive disability. ""This painter, who works exclusively with writing, designed an entire room there,"" says Schubert.
A special award was created in Germany in 2000 for people with cognitive disabilities who create art. The Augustinum Foundation bestows the ""Euward"" — a made-up word combining ""Europe"" and ""award"" — every three years to European artists. The three honorees receive, among other things, an exhibition of their work at the Haus der Kunst in Munich, which gives their work visibility. This year, an Euward will be awarded again.
One of the biggest hurdles for people with disabilities is getting into the arts and culture business at all. ""For drama schools, disabilities were an exclusion criterion until a few years ago,"" says Schubert.

But the schools are becoming more and more open, she adds. The association she works for has initiated its own program to promote inclusion in arts education. So far, universities with visual and performing arts programs from five German states are participating. In 2024, the program is to be expanded to other German states.
When Schubert compares all the inclusion efforts in the cultural sector that have been undertaken in Germany in recent years with those in neighboring countries or even in Great Britain, she nevertheless concludes that there is ""still a great deal of catching up to do"" in this country.

https://www.dw.com/en/worlds-oldest-hebrew-bible-sells-for-38-million/a-65666539,RELIGION,World's oldest Hebrew Bible sells for $38 million 18.05.2023,"A leather-bound, handwritten Hebrew Bible believed to be around 1,100 years old sold for $38.1 million (€35.1 million) in New York, auction house Sotheby's said on Wednesday.
The Codex Sassoon's price surpasses the $30.8 million paid in 1994 for Leonardo da Vinci's Codex Leicester manuscript but is below the world-record $43.2 million paid in 2021 for a first edition of the US Constitution.
Its price tag ""reflects the profound power, influence, and significance of the Hebrew Bible, which is an indispensable pillar of humanity,"" said Sotheby's Judaica specialist Sharon Liberman Mintz. 
Mintz said she was ""absolutely delighted by today's monumental result and that Codex Sassoon will shortly be making its grand and permanent return to Israel, on display for the world to see.""
Former US ambassador and president of the American Jewish Committee Alfred H. Moses bought the codex on behalf of the non-profit American Friends of ANU. It will be donated to the ANU Museum of the Jewish People in Tel Aviv, Israel.
""The Hebrew Bible is the most influential book in history and constitutes the bedrock of Western civilization. I rejoice in knowing that it belongs to the Jewish People,"" said Moses.
Before the auction, which Sotheby's said lasted for 4 minutes and was between two buyers, the manuscript was exhibited at the ANU Museum in March as part of a worldwide tour.
The codex, which was named after its previous owner David Solomon Sassoon, is believed to have been written between 880 and 960. 
Sassoon, who assembled a private collection of ancient Jewish texts, acquired it in 1929. After his death, Sassoon's estate was broken up, and Sotheby's sold the codex in 1978 to the British Rail Pension Fund for around $320,000, or $1.4 million in today's dollars.
In 1989, the pension fund sold it for $3.19 million ($7.7 million in today's dollars) to banker and art collector Jacqui Safra, who sold it on Wednesday. 
According to Sotheby's, Safra had recently had the manuscript carbon dated to confirm it was older than the Aleppo Codex and the Leningrad Codex, two other major early Hebrew Bibles.

https://www.dw.com/en/german-court-hands-sentences-to-dresden-green-vault-suspects/a-65632556,CRIME,German court hands sentences to Dresden Green Vault suspects 16.05.2023,"The district court in the eastern German city of Dresden on Tuesday sentenced members of a criminal syndicate over the theft of priceless display items from one of Europe's largest collections of treasures.
The theft of artifacts from the Green Vault was one of the most spectacular heists in German history.
The court handed down several prison sentences — ranging from four years and four months to six years and three months — to five members of Berlin's Remmo organized crime family.
They were convicted of aggravated arson in combination with dangerous bodily injury, theft with weapons, damage to property, and intentional arson.
A sixth suspect, who had an alibi and pleaded not guilty to taking part, was acquitted.
The highest sentences were against Wissam R. (26) and Rabieh R. (29), who were given six years and three months and six years and two months in prison respectively.
Four of the six defendants had admitted to involvement in the crime as part of a plea bargain, and another confessed to helping procure objects for the raid. 

The theft saw two thieves break into the vault through a window at Dresden's Royal Palace at dawn on November 25, 2019. They smashed a display case and escaped with treasures dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries.
The team had carried out reconnaissance at the premises several times and took apart a section of cast-iron guttering in advance to be able to break in more easily later, prosecutors said.







They stole some 4,300 diamonds and other precious stones from 21 jewelry items which, despite being valued at some €113 million ($122 million), many view as priceless.
Estimators place the damage caused by the break-in alone at more than €1 million.
The men started a fire to cut the power supply to street lights outside the museum just before the break-in. They also set fire to a car in a nearby garage before making their getaway to Berlin.
The suspects were caught several months later in raids in Berlin.
A large part of the loot was returned to the state collections, partly damaged, after preliminary talks in the plea bargain. 
Prosecutors suspected from an early stage that members of the Remmo family, a notorious organized crime gang of Arab heritage known as a ""clan"" in German media, were behind the Green Vault heist. A court also found the family responsible for stealing a giant gold coin — weighing 100 kilograms (220 pounds) — from Berlin's Bode Museum in 2017.
The vault is within the Royal Palace of Dresden and is home to the treasures of the Elector of Saxony and King of Poland Augustus the Strong, who first placed his family dynasty's collection of Renaissance and baroque treasures on public display in the early 18th century.
It gets its name from the green-colored columns and green velvet wall coverings in many of the museum's rooms. 
The artifacts remained on display until World War II when three of the Green Vault's eight richly decorated exhibition rooms were destroyed during an Allied air raid on Dresden in February 1945.
Fortunately, portable exhibits had already been removed beforehand and stored for safekeeping at a fortress in the nearby Elbsandstein mountains.

These items were seized by the Red Army Trophy Commission and shipped to the Soviet Union after the war and remained there until 1958 when Moscow passed a resolution providing for their return to Dresden.
Parts of the collection were placed on display in the city's Albertinum Museum because war damage made a return to the palace itself impossible.
It wasn't until more than half a century after the war that the world-famous treasures reclaimed their place at the Royal Palace in 2004 when 1,080 masterworks were placed on view.
Two years later, then-Chancellor Angela Merkel officially reopened the vault after a major multi-million-euro renovation.
Among the treasures on display are jewel-encrusted figurines, a ring that belonged to Protestant reformer Martin Luther, gold-mounted ostrich eggs, and rhinoceros-horn goblets.

https://www.dw.com/en/five-lessons-from-meron-mendels-talking-about-israel/a-65579092,CULTURE,Five lessons from Meron Mendel's 'Talking about Israel' 15.05.2023,"Meron Mendel's new book, ""Über Israel reden"" (""Talking about Israel""), examines how Israel is debated in Germany. 
A descendant of Holocaust survivors, Mendel was born in 1976 and grew up on a kibbutz in Israel. He emigrated to Germany in 2003. Since 2010, he has been the director of the Anne Frank Educational Center in Frankfurt.
Here are five ideas from his book.
In his new book, Mendel analyzes various debates and controversies about representations of Israel in Germany. 
For example, he revisits the controversy around Cameroonian historian and political scientist Achille Mbembe, who was invited to open the Ruhrtriennale music and arts festival in western Germany in 2020, but whose keynote was canceled when he compared the state of Israel with South Africa's apartheid regime. 
Other debates that are analyzed in the book include the German Bundestag's resolution against the anti-Israel Boycott, Divest, Sanction (BDS) movement in 2019, and the scandal surrounding antisemitic art displayed at the international Documenta art show in 2022.
Mendel describes how he, as an Israeli and a Jew, has been used as a tool for very different purposes. In Germany, he writes, the focus is taking a stance on Israel-related issues as opposed to a nuanced conversation — or even critically questioning one's own stance.
Every German's position on the Israel-Palestine question is ""an identity-forming question par excellence."" It comes before any other discussion, virtually as a kind of ""psychological test,"" he says.

Mendel asks how the antisemitic representations at Documenta could be better recognized and discussed rather than just scandalized? He feels there should have been more space for debate and differentiated perspectives in reaction to the controversy. Without this approach, he fears, the same story will repeat itself in a similar setting. 
Mendel portrays his own experiences throughout the book. Having emphasized that antisemitism in Germany is not merely a Muslim issue, he has become the target of pro-Israel groups who accuse him of ""relativizing Muslim antisemitism."" Some have described Mendel as a ""notorious antisemitism denier.""
His criticisms of Israeli policies have not been well-received either. 
While Mendel remembers his friendly welcome when arriving in Germany over two decades ago, he recalls that: ""When it became clear that I was much more critical about current politics in Israel and discussed that in my view, the Muslim minority is not the main threat to Jews in Germany, I was instantly declared an enemy.""
Mendel criticizes this ""black-and-white thinking"" where you can either be for or against Israel. For him, instead of trying to determine which side is right or wrong, a more central question should be trying to determine how moderate forces from both the Israeli and the Palestinian side can be supported.
Mendel urges self-reflection as a first measure when questions arise in Germany about Israel and the Middle East conflict.
For example, in the current heated discussion about Israel's settlement policy, where comparisons with the Nazi regime are sometimes made, it seems for many Germans ""to be a relief to be able to label Jews in an unfamiliar reversed role as 'perpetrators'."" This, he says, can allow Germans ""to distance themselves from their own responsibility without having to deal with it.""
He adds that reversing the roles of the victims and the perpetrators can offer some relief from a German perspective: ""After all, the Jews are just as bad as our own ancestors!""
""This exoneration strategy, which first emerged among right-wing radicals, is now also found in well-educated circles of people who see themselves as historically conscious and left-wing,"" Mendel adds. 
As a trained historian, Mendel sees comparisons as a natural means of observation and analysis.
But equating the Shoah and the Nakba — meaning ""catastrophe"" in Arabic, this is remembered on May 15, the start of the Arab-Israel War in 1948 when some 700,000 Palestinians were displaced from their homeland — is not historically tenable, says Mendel.
""Behind the claim is the urge to delegitimize the very existence of the state of Israel,"" he argues.
Mendel repeatedly emphasizes the importance of recognizing the suffering of different victims of violence (not least that of Palestinians). ""The call for more empathy toward the 'other' is in itself to be applauded,"" he says. ""But it is significant that it often goes hand-in-hand with a lack of empathy toward Jews, who are seen as the privileged others.""
Critics accuse Israel of treating Palestinians with the approach of an imperial colonial state. This diminishes the significance of the Shoah as the event leading to the founding of the Israeli state, Mendel believes.  
Empathy is not created by comparing the death toll in Auschwitz to the death toll in the Omaheke desert — when German colonizers massacred local Herero and Nama people in Namibia in the early 1900s in what has been called a genocide. 
According to Mendel, such comparisons are based on the ""desire to 'normalize' the German discourse on Israel, to condemn Israel harshly without having to take into account its historic origins."" In other words, to present Israel as just one colonial state among many.
Other injustices do not have to be understood by way of comparison, he says. ""The suffering of other groups or individuals and their commemoration is not affected by the memory of the Holocaust.""
Mendel concludes that German accountability for Israel today could involve taking a clear stand against right-wing extremism, ""even if it occurs in the Israeli cabinet.""
""Talking about Israel"" could become a new German virtue, an art of ""criticizing without negating one's own responsibility,"" he suggests.
